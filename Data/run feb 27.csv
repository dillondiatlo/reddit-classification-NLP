1,1415039693.0,Morning run happened to cut through a 50 mile ultra ... hilarity ensues,"Saturday morning I went out at about 9am for a 10 mile run along the lake. I'm not particularly fast, I averaged an 8:45 pace.

About 5 miles in, I see a cone marking the turnaround point for what appeared to be a small 10k fun run or something. As I ran past, I asked one of the guys standing at the turnaround if I can use the path. They say sure, there aren't that many people in the race, no problem.

So I keep running, and start to see more and more people running with bib numbers. It was fairly cold out, and some people's bib numbers were barely visible if they'd put on a jacket or had it pinned somewhere not so prominent. As I pass an aid station, they start cheering me on saying to keep going and I'm doing great. I assume they just thought my bib number wasn't visible, and I was too cold to really stop and say anything otherwise.

Now I'm starting to pass people left and right. They really look in poor form, most of them pretty raggedy and just staggering along. I think to myself, man I am CRUSHING these guys, this must be the worst 10k I've ever seen. Note to self, look this race up later and dominate the next one!

After passing ~20 people, I see a sign up ahead marking the mileage... **""50k turnaround, 50 mile turnaround ahead.""** *WHAT???* Turns out I stumbled upon an ultra, and these poor runners I was passing were likely about 20 miles into their run.

I felt like a complete idiot, but still had a few miles to go on my route, so I kept going. Passing the next aid station, the workers yell to me ""Keep going! You look incredible!"" No shit, relative to someone running an ultra.

I try to reply ""Sorry I'm not actually running in this race, but thanks!"" But being about 40F outside, my mouth dexterity is all but gone, and I manage to slur ""I'm not running!"" The aid workers look at each other with a puzzled look on their faces, and must have determined I was delirious or something, because they responded, ""Yeaaaaaah you're running! You look amazing! Keep it up!""

I'm too ashamed at this point to correct them, and just keep running past. About a mile later I duck off the course and quickly run to a coffee shop to hide my head in shame.

TL;DR - Unwittingly join an ultra, pass other runners, realize they are ~20 miles into an ultra, aid station thinks I am wunderkind of ultras.

edit: Haven't had access to reddit most of the afternoon... to answer questions - the race was the lakefront 50/50 in Chicago, which is a 50k and 50 mile race on the same course just more laps from what I can gather on their website. I saw the 50k turnaround sign, so I guess the first one I passed was for the 50 miler crowd. Also my bad for cringe worthy title, I don't internet good.",running

 February 15, I came home from work, to find my fiancee u/weeleigh, was not home. Thinking nothing of it as our Devil Dog was also gone I figured she was out for a run, which is very normal. I assumed she would be back shortly as she just got over a toe injury. 30 minutes later, I figured she was going for a bit longer. Boy was I wrong.

An hour later, I started to get worried. I then received a call from her father. My world came crashing down. She was struck by a car while running in the heart of Baltimore City, the Inner Harbor. She was crossing a major intersection. My worst fears have come to. They took her to Shock Trauma where she was fighting for life. They took the Devil Dog to the pet er. There was massive trauma to her head, but I knew if there was any chance of survival she could. Luckily, she was at the best Neurohospital in the nation. We were told 2 weeks to see what the damage would be.

The next day the doctors called for a family meeting. And I knew. I didn't want to go to the hospital. I didn't want to lose her, my fiancee, my best friend, and my running partner. The damage was too severe. They literally did all they could to save her. In short, we donated her organs and it saved at least 3 peoples lives. 

I held her hand as they took her off life support as I promised her I would never leave her until the very end. I can't believe such a wonderful woman was taken from me, from her family, from her friends. I can't believe that someone who worked so hard to be healthy, to extend her life, was gone.

u/WeeLeigh was so committed to life and to running that she was, when struck, doing her 351st run in a row. She was excited to get to 365, to train for Ultras, and of course to plan our wedding. On March 1st, what would have been her 365 day of running I restarted my own streak, with my friends and the Devil Dog recovered from her own injuries (I ended it 280 days while staying at the hospital.) I figured I would continue what she cannot do anymore.

On a general PSA, please, please, please, check both ways while running across intersections. We are 100% sure that she was in the right, something tragic happened. I will make another post about a memorial run for her.

19,1603483850.0,"I lost my job, I'm depressed, and it's been a terrible year all round (for many of us), but I just ran my first sub 1:30 half marathon, and honestly? it feels amazing.","**Race Information**

* **Name:** Ryan's Half Marathon
* **Age:** 27
* **Date:** October 23, 2020
* **Distance:** 21.1 km
* **Location:** Battersea Park, London
* **Time:** 1:28:15

Hello again guys!

**Intro:**

So I recently lost a job I deeply truly loved due to the big C, and the feelings of worthlessness, self pity and general apathy have hit me like a freight train, running has been a safe constant during the last 6 months, the one thing keeping me 'moving', though I like to joke that I'm just really good at running away from my problems. That all culminated in a time trial today that has left me feeling good about myself for the first time in a while, but enough of a pity party here's the lowdown:

I began running at the start of April and managed some pretty quick noob gains; I posted back in August after hitting a sub 20 minute 5k, and got some good feedback about my goals which were a 40 minute 10k in September and a 1:30 half in October. (Generally this being increase easy distance + fast workouts, alongside some ""that's going to be really really tough, but good luck to you""). Still, I tapped into my masochistic side and decided to persevere in getting this done. I managed a 40:02 10k in September almost by accident - I had revised my expectations so just set a tempo on my watch of between 4:00 and 4:10 per km and wasn't too focused on the time, if I had been I definitely would have sprinted that last 100metres to knock the 2 seconds off! I know it's not officially sub 40, but it was a moral victory for me and I wanted to keep going for another 4 week cycle with a half marathon time trial at the end of it.

**Training:**

If you're interested in what a typical week looked like for the previous 3 weeks it consisted of 3 easy ish runs between 10km and 15km at around a 5:00/km pace, one long run of 18km+, one tempo run at half marathon pace that I gradually built up from 12km to 15km (this run gave me a LOT of confidence in my ability to smash the time trial), and intervals of either 10x500m with 45 second walk rest at 3:30/km or 6x1km with 90 seconds rest at 3:40/km (these were sorta with a >18:30 5k attempt next month in mind as well as hopefully making 4:16 pace seem *relatively* easy).

This week I tried to ease off my training, same number of easy runs but for shorter distances (and only a smallish tempo with no workouts). Yesterday I did a short run (for me) of 7km, but with 6 sets of strides to just wake my legs up.

**The Race:**

Honestly, pretty painful. I had a very good idea of the total distance around Battersea Park which is a little under 3km so knew 7 and a half laps would do the trick. A bit like my 10km PB I cheated a little by basically setting a workout on my watch of 21x1km with a pace aim of 4:10 to 4:15 per km, I know it's a bit naughty but honestly my pacing is awful, and this is hopefully something I can develop as I gain more experience running (the more I run, the more I realise 6 months is *nothing* in running terms). This helped massively and I'm honestly super proud of the median range of my splits, with the majority coming between 4:11 and 4:16 with only one 4:17 and one 4:18, I also threw in some quick km's at the start, and finished off the last 2 in 8 minutes so a great kick too!  I definitely knew I was good for the sub 1:30 but it was absolutely brilliant to see 1:28:15 pop up at the end, smashing my previous best of 1:36 something from early September (though that was a hilly route and I wasn't going utterly all out).

**Post-Race:**

Thankfully I had enough left in the tank for 3km jog home, but let me tell you, it was not fun. Otherwise today has been about relaxing and eating good food. I think I'll take tomorrow off then a really easy 15km run on Sunday to keep up my 70km+ weeks (more a point of pride than anything else). Up next as I mentioned will be a 5k in 4 weeks time, I tend to do my time trials in 4 week cycles alternating between 5,10 and 21.1 kilometres. I'm hoping after the next 3 month cycle I'll have times that fall relatively in line with a 3 hour marathon predictor, after which I'll work on increasing my distance and eventually get that Boston BQ late next year when hopefully Marathons are back!

Honestly I'm absolutely thrilled with how far I've come since I started running. I am not a naturally gifted sportsperson at all, my parents reaction was essentially ""are you sure it didn't glitch the distance? because you certainly didn't get any sports genes from us"". I'm proving others, and more importantly right now, myself wrong in what I can accomplish and it feels pretty good. I don't have many friends that can conceptualise what this result means, so I'm hoping a few of you lovely redditors might appreciate it!  


Edit:  Honestly I was not expecting a response like this, I want you guys to know I appreciate each and every one of you, for the upvotes, your comments and the awards, I've gone through a really tough time recently and to get this level of support from the community is so inspiring, I definitely have no choice but to keep running now!",running
20,1617129072.0,What has been the most embarrassing thing that’s happened to you while running?,"Last night I ran on a trail section at a local park where I had by far the most embarrassing moment of my long running career several years ago. So I was reminded of that moment and honestly wanted to read about your embarrassing moments so I don’t feel quite so bad. 

Mine was just at a local park. It has a crushed gravel trail around a lake, and during the week, especially in the mornings it is very remote and sparsely used. You can often see wildlife, and it’s nice to just put on your headphones and chuck away some miles. Well it was on one of these mornings where I was lost in a song, and found myself a little gassy. Well.... I was all alone in a remote park, so I passed gas over a number of strides and IMMEDIATELY was passed by an entire high school cross country team that was apparently out training, and they all had emphatic comments like.... “sweet”, “that was impressive”, “taco Tuesday?”, etc.

22,1613392573.0,Saved by pepper spray,"I've been running in my neighborhood for 15yrs and bitten by 5 dogs.  The last one was a vicious pit bull attack that left scars on my right arm.  After the attack, I purchased pepper spray gel for runners and always carry it.  Well, yesterday was the day.  The day I won.  The day a pitbull mix came after me and I was able to spray the dog at about 4 feet as it charged.  He shook off the first spray and came in for a second charge but this time I really got him in the mouth and eyes.   The owner came out during the commotion and was upset that I sprayed her dog.  She said, ""he just wants you to pet him"".  BS, as I said, I've been bitten 5 times so I know what it looks like when you're about to get munched on.  At this point, I lost it and started yelling at her about controlling her dog and if she can't control it she should own it.

If you have issues with dogs in your area, I highly recommend pepper spray gel.

Edit:  Wow.  I never expected this to blow up like this.  Interesting side note, every time I was bitten it was in a cul-de-sac and the owners were close by believing they had their dogs under control.  I believe part of the reason for the high number is the law of averages, I run 5 days per week and it's a 3.5-mile loop so I pass each house between 1-3 times depending on the run distance.  These dogs see 100's of times so when they get a chance to grab me they go for it :).   The pit bull that attacked me in the fall was put down for being a vicious dog - apparently, it had done it before.

2011 miles, four states, three pairs of shoes and one half marathon later, I want to share some of the things I’ve learned through this endeavor. 

Please share yours in the comments!

1. A year is a long time. 365 days is a lot of days.

2. Discipline is more effective than motivation. 

3. I have never regretted a run. 

4. Runners high is real. 

5. Sunscreen and Vaseline are important in the summer. Gloves are clutch in the winter. 

6. Goals and boundaries are important: no relationships or work have been irreparably harmed in the pursuit of this goal. 

7. Running in the rain isn’t so bad. Running in the cold rain is pretty bad. Running in the wind sucks. 

8. Very few people want to talk about running. In fact, even less than you’d expect. 

9. Many terrible seeming problems and conflict can be minimized with space and distance. 

10. Movement is integral to my mental health and happiness.",running

28,1622992814.0,I Ran A 5K Within 40 Minutes!,"A lot of people here can easily do this, but for me it’s a goal I’ve had since 2013. 

I’ve ran plenty of races, and all of them have been in the 40’s. I could never run the entire thing without walking a little. I include the treadmill and running at a park with decent elevation gain. Every time I’d focus on losing weight and improving my cardio, I’ve got serious about running. I’d sign up for a bunch of 5Ks, quarter marathons, and so on. I’d use them as motivation and do my best to get in shape for them, running some at the low 300’s (pounds), most of them between 250 and 300. I’ve completed the couch to 5K more times than I can even remember. 

My mom died in April of 2019 and I have my first child, a daughter, less than four months later. I stopped going to the gym immediately after she died. On the road trip to her funeral, I started drinking pop again after quitting for years and bought candy and snacks as we stopped at gas stations. I was 260 pounds. By the summer of 2020, I was 400 pounds, the highest recorded weight I’ve ever been.

I decided to get gastric sleeve surgery because I was terrified of not being there to raise my daughter and see her grow up. 

This time, I told myself I wasn’t going to sign up for any races, going at a comfortable pace, progressing on a timeline I could control. I started in March and could barely jog at 4mph, no incline on the treadmill, for 30 seconds. Every week, depending on how I felt, I would add 15-30 seconds to my run. 

Four weeks ago, I went to my first Orangetheory class. I’ve only gone once a week. I was nervous. In the weeks leading I was vomiting every day, had to run outside of the gym to vomit once. I showed up to the first class and three more. I am the fattest guy there but I don’t let that slow me down. Suddenly, my cardio was getting rapidly better. I can’t eat a lot of calories, so getting a good balance has been difficult. I found out I went from prediabetic to hypoglycemic, and that’s why I felt terrible. I’ve dropped my metformin as directed by my doctor and that’s taken away most symptoms but they still pop up with less severity.

Anyway, every week I’ve shaved a minute or more off of my time since I’ve started Orangetheory. I finally got a sub 40 5k. It was on the treadmill with an incline. I don’t care that it was on a treadmill. I couldn’t do it in any of my journeys until today. I was 400 pounds last fall. Now I am 255 and ran my best 5K. I tacked on another mile, which I got in 53 mins. I broke my rule and signed up for a 4 miler a couple weeks ago. I want to get within 50 mins by August, when the race is.

If you read this, I appreciate you. This is a huge accomplishment for me!",running
29,1619368891.0,"The joy of running broken,old and fat.","In October of 2018 my wife and I where informed by our daughter that she was going to run the Houston marathon.  I was 54 years old and 320 pounds. We were so proud of her determination to take on such an endeavor and decided we would drive down to see her cross the finish line in support. Becky and I had been talking about getting into running to better our health and shed a few pounds. We also decided to sign up for the Houston 5K that was to happen the morning the day before our daughter's marathon. We downloaded C25K. Our first day of using the C25K app left us winded and sore after logging a 32 minute mile walk. We persisted and on January 13 2018 we ran our first 5K along with thousands of other fellow pavement pounders. We finished in a time of 48 minutes and change. We decided to sign up for the half marathon in 2019. In September of 2018 I tore my meniscus on my right knee and had surgery to repair the damage. In January of 2019 we ran the Houston half marathon and finished in just under 4 hours. We have since logged numerous 5K runs both community and virtual, but have never bettered our time of 48 minutes. (danged covid) In May of 2019 I had a knee replacement of my right knee. After recovery and therapy we resumed our running and began a diet plan to get my weight off. Today I am 70 pounds lighter and this morning we decided to run a 5K distance at a local park trail where we run every Sunday. We pushed to get our time under 45 minutes and damned if we didn't do it. 44 minutes 49 seconds. I know that seems pretty pathetic in the eyes of some, but for me the accomplishment of that 5K time meant more to me than losing what weight I have over the last year. I hope to continue to improve and enjoy running with my wife until they have to put me down.",running

31,1591281501.0,Running doesn't suck; Being out of shape sucks.,"I think this was one of the main thoughts that turned me from a couch potato to a complete running addict, and I share it so that someone else may benefit. For me it proved to be subtle but powerful.

At my first football tryouts (in 6th grade), the coaches had us jog, maybe a half mile. After a lazy summer, it felt horrible. I thought what most people think when this happens: ""I want to avoid this situation as much as possible for the rest of my life."" There are two basic approaches to that. You can avoid physical activity as much as possible or you can embrace it so you are ready next time. I chose to embrace it. After every practice, I ran a lap around the field. When the season ended, I said that now's the time to stay in shape and continued working out. By 8th grade, I was so addicted to running that I did both XC and football practices back to back. The idea is that once one gets in shape, it's way easier to maintain than to fall off and get back on the wagon.

Has anyone else been through something similar?

Disclaimer: HIIT is tough no matter how in shape I get. I live in the Maffetone zone unless my day is really boring-then I crave the adversity and accomplishment feeling from HIIT.

Edit: Disclaimer #2 as a response to comments: There are people out there who are in shape and still don't like running. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that! I understand how this post might come off as discouraging, and that is the exact opposite of my intention. The main idea is that a lot more people would enjoy running if they gave it a proper chance by 1 getting through that first absolutely miserable phase of getting into shape 2 understanding good form and 3 pacing themselves. I think a more accurate statement would be ""Getting in shape is very hard, but staying in shape is very fun so long as you find an activity that you enjoy. Once in shape, you may find yourself loving activities that you used to hate. Also, don't go hard unless you feel like it or you feel like doing something that you don't feel like doing. You'll like any activity more that way"".

It's about how you talk to *yourself.* We all have those days where a run isn't what we want to do but if you've already conditioned yourself that you're a runner, guess what? You're going to lace up your sneakers, because that's what runners do. 
We all have different running goals. Mine are being healthy, looking good in shorts, being able to outrun a bad guy and refusing to go gently into my 40s. Do I have interest in running a marathon? Not really. I admire those who do but it isn't for me. I don't think I'm less than a runner for that. (It's all about outrunning a grizzly for me.)",running
33,1664145801.0,"An OWL grabbed my head while running, UPDATE ONE YEAR LATER","Hello r/running!

It's been awhile, so just in case you never read my two other posts, you can find them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/lfpwgx/a_hawk_grabbed_my_head_while_running_update_it/). Long story short, I live in an area known for aggressive/territorial owls. I run early in the morning and during the winter I have had to deal with owl swoopings/head grabs. I've been attacked a total of four times (twice actual contact, twice very close swoops). I was desperate for a solution and reached out to this community and the bird subreddit. 

A few users suggested sewing eyes on the back of my hat. I purchased giant googly eyes but honestly they were tough to adhere (I hot glued safety pins on the eyes then attached them to the hat) and a pain to take off when I wanted to wash the hat/not run with googly eyes. [Including a pic for your laughs.](https://imgur.com/a/YKIGu7X)

I thought this was just going to be my kind of annoying solution until my sister sent me [this mask](https://imgur.com/sNQ7yeJ) as a funny ha-ha-you-have-a-bizarre-owl-problem joke. 

Well joke's on her because the mask was exactly what I needed!! With it's easy elastic band and flimsy plastic front the [mask easily fits on the back of my head.](https://imgur.com/bpamMp9) It's also easy to remove so if I'm on a long run that seeps into daylight I can take it off instead of being that weirdo runner lady with the backwards mask on. And you know what?? IT WORKS. I started wearing the mask in September/October of last year and I haven't been attacked by an owl since. I was [just featured](https://westseattleblog.com/2022/09/reader-report-one-solution-for-deterring-swooping-owls/) on my local blog about my solution.

A big thank you to everyone for coming up with some great ideas like peeing on the owl to mark my territory, making sure I'm not a Disney Princess and moving. 

A big F U to everyone who told me to watch the HBO show The Staircase because the scene with the owl WAS SO TRIGGERING. Also maybe that was a crazy aggressive owl but in the 4 times I've encountered one they hit then fly away so yeah he def killed her.

34,1597064887.0,Yesterday I ran my first half marathon and since they were all cancelled my family and friends made me a “finish line.” I feel like I’m floating with joy,"Two years ago I had some pretty severe postpartum depression. I started to train for a 5k and little by little I started to feel alive again. I completely came off my medication and now I enjoy life with my son. Flash forward to when COVID hit and I needed something to look forward to so I signed up for a half marathon!

It’s been an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling process for me but I was so disappointed when every race in my area was cancelled due to COVID. Instead of cancelling or waiting until next year, I decided to make my own route and do it alone. I told my friends and family and they all came together to make me a “finish line.” 

The run itself was my hardest run because it was so hot and humid. I wanted to quit so many times because I felt like I could faint at any moment and my hamstring was so tight but I just kept focusing on everyone I loved waiting for me and how 2 years ago I really didn’t want to live anymore but here I am today doing the hardest thing I’ve ever done.

As soon as I turned the corner and saw my son and the people I love most waiting for me I burst into tears. I never expected to feel so accomplished and elated in this process but it has brought me so much joy and fulfillment. 

I was shooting for an under 2 hour time, but I finished at 2:15 with an average pace of 10”25. I am still proud of this time though because it was by far my hottest and hardest long distance run!

I could already feel my pace picking up simply because I didn't have to fight harder to keep cool.

36,1529888235.0,Acknowledge Fat Runners,"In November of 2016, I went to the doctor for a minor sickness. As one does at the doctors office, I stepped on the scale. 299 pounds. I was speechless. Not because I was shocked I was fat, I knew I was. I was simply overcome by the fact that the next time weighed myself, I’d likely weigh over 300 pounds. 

I promised myself that would never happen. I changed my diet and started walking. I walked all winter. Dropping the first 20 pounds was pretty easy, but I ran into a wall at 280. As the snow here in Indianapolis started to melt, I decided to start running. 

My first attempt I made it less than a quarter of a mile. I was gasping, my knees hurt, wanted to quit. I walked 100 yards and ran again. Over the next couple of months, with the help of my wife, Ashlee, I started running longer and longer distances. 

I can’t tell you how intimidating it was to venture out on greenways and trails with “real” runners. Everyone seemed so fit, so effortless, so powerful. Being fat and jumping into running around others can feel really lonely. 

Being acknowledged made all the difference. As I gasped along the Monon Trail here in Indy, I noticed something special: complete strangers pulling for me. Sometimes it came in the form of “hey keep it up” or “good job runner”, but usually, it was simply making eye contact and a quick smile. It meant the world. It made me feel part of something. It made me want to be a runner. Runners are kind, generous people who want others to excel and grow. At least, that’s my experience. But hey, I’m a runner so maybe I’m biased :) 

As the summer wore on, the pounds dropped off. In October 2017 I ran my first 13.1 in 2:17. In January 2018, I got down to my current weight of 235 and ran my first sub 2 (1:59:53) in Chicago at the F^3. In March, I hit my current PR of 1:54:57 at the Carmel Half Marathon. 

My big goal this year is to break 1:45 and complete my first marathon in November in 4 hours. 

I’m not a fat runner anymore, just a chubby one on my way to crushing my fitness goals. 

I probably wouldn’t be anywhere close to where I am today if it weren’t for the existence of kind strangers who had the empathy to look me in the eye and believe in me.

Would’ve been fine with 3.50 or 4. NOT 3.96! 🥴

Editing to say: I don’t run “seriously” or train for anything, nor do I run to burn calories or track steps, or anything like that. I just run because it’s fun and it helps lessen anxiety.

I’ve been running since the end of March. I started doing it because the gyms were closed and I’ve avoided cardio like the plague so I wanted to get better at it. Also I was finally recovered enough from my second ACL surgery that I felt comfortable running outside. For the first 2 months I would just go out and run hard and get exhausted after 45 seconds and then grind out the rest of the run, usually ending my runs with low 13 or high 12 minute miles. 

I started to get better but I never really had a goal or plan. After chatting with coworkers I learned that I should do different types of runs like shorter, longer, quicker, or slower. I did that for a while and ran my first 5k ever in about 39:00. I was pretty happy but still knew I had a lot of improvement ahead of me.

I eventually started using the NRC app and wow. That completely changed my mindset. I learned that running could be relaxing, enjoyable, and even fun! With slowing down I actually started getting faster and faster. This totally blew my mind. I was always looking at everything as a sprint type of thing, “if I don’t run fast at the beginning, I’m not running hard enough.” Well I’m so happy I’ve realized this and the guided runs have been a huge help.

Back to this morning. I got ready, stretched and went outside. Turned on my music (Run The Jewels if anyone was wondering). I decided to see how fast I could run a mile. I started running very slow for a quick little warm up and then turned on my app timer. While running I felt pretty good about .4 miles into it but definitely started hitting that part where your brain just keeps telling you to stop. I thought back to some stuff I learned and did a maintenance check. First focused on my breathing, then my shoulders, arms, legs, and feet. I felt better once I calmed myself down and started to pick it up a little again. I ran for a while longer and then looked down and saw that I was at .83 miles, almost there! I focused and pushed until I heard the app say, “Distance: 1 Mile, Pace: 9 minutes and 32 seconds.”

Your life can be taken away in a matter of seconds.,"Last Thursday I put on my running shoes for an easy 10 mile recovery run. I was especially tired that morning as I was coming off another high mileage week and I wasn’t getting great sleep as a result of a stressful work week.

I left my house and prepared to cross the only major intersection on my typical route. As I looked to my right I saw a steady line of traffic on the other side of the road. I looked to my left and didn’t see any incoming cars. It was still dark out as it was just before 6 AM.
As I waited for the last car to pass from the line of cars I entered the intersection. I then heard a loud screech and looked to my left and saw big bright headlights.
I tried to retract back to the sidewalk but did not make it in time.

The truck swerved and hit me with the front end of his bumper. The collision sent me rolling  and skidding on the asphalt. I got up quickly and made my back to the sidewalk. I stood on the sidewalk hunched over trying to figure out mentally what had just happened. I was in complete shock, however, I was. not unconscious or disoriented. Once I recollected myself, all I could think about was all gear (watch, hat, phone) laying in the street about to get run over. The driver of the vehicle got out to ask if I I was okay and told me he called the cops.

It seemed like hours but the cops finally showed up. They told me to walk about 500 feet to sit down on a bench so I could give distance between myself and the driver and wait for an ambulance. This was a terrible idea. Up until that point I hadn’t moved an inch and stood like a statue hunched over. The hip pain was unbearable and my foot was a bloody mess but somehow the adrenaline got my legs to move and I made my way to the bench. The ambulance arrived and I was rushed to the hospital. 

I received x rays and a CT scan. Outside of some lacerations and road rash I had 1 broken toe and a bruised hip bone. My foot did get ripped up pretty bad as you can see in the link below and my Boston’s were shredded in half.
My body was bruised and swollen but I did not have any serious or life threatening injuries. 

When I say I’m lucky to be alive I do not say that lightly. The driver was going 50 in a 45 and driving a Ford F-350. Had the driver not swerved upon seeing me enter the intersection he would have hit me head on and most likely killed me. In that split second he reacted and saved my life.

Now on to the embarrassing things I am ashamed to admit. I didn’t wear reflective gear that morning. Actually my clothes were dark.
I did not thoroughly check both sides before crossing. I did not get enough sleep the night before and as a result started my run groggy and seemingly half asleep. All of these poor decisions compounded into what could have been a fatal mistake. As a result I would have left behind my wife, my three year old son and a three month old baby. 

Being that close to death shook me to my core. I haven’t slept well since leaving the hospital. I close my eyes and see the headlights coming at me. I know we all hear these stories and think “oh that dumb runner or cyclist!” It’s almost as if it makes us feel better thinking of them as dumb so we can rationalize us being smarter than that and never making these mistakes. But now I AM the dumb runner who made the mistake that could have cost me my life.

My plea in all this is to just be smart. Wear reflective gear, get good sleep so you can be sharp mentally, avoid listening to music with cars around and always look both ways. I feel like I get a second chance at life again so I want to share this to help people not make the same mistakes I made. As for now I will be recovering and preparing myself for the day I will once again hit the roads. Pictures of my accident are below (blood alert) and a link to my activity of the run on Strava.

52,1618780027.0,Was wholesomely “catcalled” today,"Obligatory not really a catcall but what I was bracing for. 

So it’s spring and getting warmer so I wear shorts and a sports bra for most of my runs. Running seems hard enough without having an extra piece of sweaty fabric clinging to me. Plus I always used to run mostly in a rural area with not much traffic so I never thought about what I wore except what would be the most comfortable. But, I’ve moved to a busier spot so my normal warm weather running outfits get more comments than I’m used to. I’ve been averaging about one catcall per run since it’s gotten warm out, which isn’t too bad given what some have to deal with, but not what I was used to. I try not to let it bother me too much. Mostly I try to view it as entertainment for my group chat as in “you’ll never guess what someone said today!”

So today, when a car in the other lane started to slow down and the man rolled down his window, I braced myself for the inevitable sexualized comment coming. But instead, he said, “you’re doing great! Keep it up!” and gave me a thumbs up. I actually smiled and felt myself pick up the pace! The one comment actually made me feel better for the rest of my run rather than tense and on guard! I just felt so grateful someone took the chance to lift someone up rather than put them down with their comments so I wanted to share!",running
53,1610490999.0,"I improved my mile time by 30 seconds (8:10 to 7:40) by running at an 11 min/mi pace for the past few months. I thought you guys were joking when you said running more miles at a slower pace is what improves your times, but I was wrong!!","I've been a lurker on this sub for the past few months since I took up running as a hobby this summer. Prior to that I only ran what was required of me in middle and high school PE

When I first began running I read through tons of comments on here looking for advice on how to get faster, everyone just said, ""Run more, at an easy pace.""

I honestly thought you guys were all just playing a joke on me, because in the past I'd spent years in high school trying to improve my mile time just by doing random sprint or HIIT drills in some futile effort to get faster. Nothing worked so after maintaining around an 8:10 mile PR since my freshman year in high school I just accepted that was my mile time, and that I probably wouldn't be faster unless I lost some weight to be lighter. This is what happened previously when I lost about 15lbs and my time went from 9:50 min/mi to 8:10 min/mi in high school, so I thought if I lost 15lbs more I could improve my time again.

But the past month I actually listened to what people said on here. I've been running SUPER slowly, at what sometimes feels like a snail pace or a granny jog around 11 min/mi. But what made the difference was that at this pace, I began to be able to put in more time actually running! 

The slower I went, the longer I could sustain my pace, and the better I got at being able to go up hills without stopping to walk. I found that as soon as I began focusing on ""how long can I run for"" and trying to increase my endurance, my mileage during those periods of running naturally increased. So I was able to put down 3mi in 33 min rather than 2.7mi in 33 min, and over time I got slowly faster and improved my endurance.

I didn't lose any weight, and actually gained a couple pounds these past few months, so it wasn't me being lighter that made me a better runner. It was just spending more time running :)

I just wanted to post this because I was actually shocked at this huge improvement in my time. I feel that next time I go for a new record I will actually be able to break this PR, because I slowed down a bit toward the end when I could have kept pushing.

Thanks to everyone on here that gives advice, and I'm sorry that I thought you guys were joking for so long!",running

57,1640220480.0,A year ago today I ran a marathon on zero days of training and it put me in the hospital through Christmas.,"Long Version:  

I’ve been a runner my whole life, including a D3 National Qualifier in Track. In my mid 20s, after the horrific Boston Marathon Bombing, I decided to get into marathons. I ran one a year starting in 2013, totaling 9 completed marathons through 2019 including Boston twice and a PR in Chicago at 2:53. 

When the pandemic hit in 2020, I had let the year slip away and had not completed nor even trained for a marathon. I told my wife I was going to just wake up one morning and run it, no training, even if I had to go slowly. Even if it took me all day.  I was out of time and I had to just go for it. 

So on December No22nd, 2020,  I woke up early and ran the first half of the marathon through my town and local state park arriving back to my house for the halfway mark, some Gatorade, GUs, and an adorable sign from my daughter. I remarked to my wife that I couldn’t believe how great I felt. 

The second half went as most of my marathons have, getting progressively harder each mile leading up to the finish. The last 5 miles I pushed my daughter in her jogging stroller and was able to cross the finish line having just run a sub 4 hour marathon on zero days of training. I was blown away! I celebrated with a beer and a cookie just as if I had crossed a real finish line. I couldn’t believe what I had just accomplished! 

As the day progressed I started feeling more and more lethargic and barely had the energy by dinner to even enjoy my celebratory burger. My wife asked what was wrong and I told her (being that I’m an ICU nurse and had a pretty good idea) that it was quite possible I was in rhabdomylosis and that my kidneys were shutting down. (Rhabdo is when muscle tissue breaks down and releases a protein called myoglobin which then in turn damages the kidneys.) This was the straw that broke the anxious camel’s back, and she begged me to go to the ER. I decided she was probably right and so I drove myself, around 11pm, into the local ER. 

After arriving in the emergency department, with adrenaline now coursing through many veins, I was convinced I was actually just fine and that I didn’t need to be there, but agreed to stay for some IV fluids and blood tests.  When the ER doc returned with the results he said we had made the right call and sure enough I was in rhabdomylosis and had an acute kidney injury. I spent the next 3 nights getting constant IV fluids trying to flush out my kidneys and avoid total kidney failure and dialysis. 

The amount of IV fluid it required to flush my kidneys led to severe edema (swelling) and pleural effusions (water at the base of my lungs). Despite all this my kidney function began improving by the afternoon on Christmas and I was discharged that night. 

Lesson learned. Always train for a marathon.",running

Where as in the cold, I can always layer up. And I find it motivational, cause if you stop running in freezing temperatures, you’ll probably just die. So you gotta keep moving. The air when it’s cold is nice and crisp, almost refreshing.

59,1599145038.0,1st time running without a shirt,"I 28F have been running for the past 4 years on a regular basis, and I really love it. I was never overweight, but had a soft stomach. Even now after 4 years of lifting/running, my stomach is still the softest part of me, and I've always been a little self conscious about it. I also have 3 scars on my stomach where i had surgery when I was younger.

Yesterday was another humid day in Georgia. I met one of my running partners downtown on the beltline, which is a crowded trail in the city. When we got out of the car, I removed my shirt, leaving just a sports bra and shorts on. We walked to the trail, passed a few restaurants. Not going to lie, i was feeling self conscious and exposed. One lady was standing on the side walk and she looked me in the eyes, then she looked at my stomach. For some reason, it actually made me feel good. Made me feel like she was admiring my stomach and my confidence!

So we get to the trail and off I go. I play some amazing music, pass other runners, im feeling great! And when i finished running, I felt so good feeling the sweat roll down my stomach, no hot wet shirt attaching to me. I felt free. I felt self love. I didnt care about people looking at me, I was feeling so good it didnt even matter!

I went running again today shirtless and will continue to do this until the weather changes. Next step will be shirtless in the gym. I wanted to share this because regardless of your size, flaws, scars ect, lifes too short. Do what you want to do regardless of what people might think. YOU ARE WORTH IT!

60,1606071741.0,Losing 100 Pounds With Running,"On December 22nd 2019, I told my parents that I was going to complete a half marathon in 2020. At the time, I was 266.6 pounds at 6'. They were very supportive and loving, but (rightfully so), I think they were  skeptical. I chose running because it was the one thing I was the worst at. I couldn't do it for any extended period of time, I hated the way I looked while running, and I hated how my lungs burned. By challenging myself to do the thing I was worst at, I wanted to prove that I could do ""anything"". My first run was January 1st 2020, and I was on Week 1 Day 1 of C25K. I nearly vomited after only ONE minute of running. My fitness was absolutely horrific, and I turned that disgust for myself into motivation. Despite shin splints due to my weight, I continued pushing with running (taking a month off to heal) while continuing to lose weight. This morning, (10 months later) I completed an 8 mile run for my half-marathon training plan. My race is December 13th, and I am 169 pounds. I wanted to share this so that people in my situation know that it can be done, because I was very skeptical about my chances of success in the early stages. Thanks for reading!

He didn't care about my pace. He didn't care about the shoes I wore, or my race times and distances, or how long I've been a runner. He saw my dedication of getting out five days a week for months on months to pound the pavement and respected that.

Anyone who's been around runnit for a while sees Those posts from beginners. You know the ones; they're laden with fear of judgment and ""am I a real runner if my pace is slow?"" But the reality is, you're the only one who knows you're ""slow."" Everyone watching just sees a runner, and the vast majority have zero idea of what your pace is and if it's ""good."" What they actually notice is that you're out day after day, building the dedication to taking care of yourself and reaching your goals.

(In fact, the only time I ever got a comment on my pace, it was a hearty ""look at you! Taking it at a nice easy pace! That's how you stick with it."") 

That's my rant of the day. Yeah, I'm a ""slow"" runner, and I'm not going to put any caveats on that. I'm slow. I don't need to justify it, because I get out there consistently, to better myself and take care of my mental and physical health, and that's something to be respected as much as any winning race time.

64,1658709642.0,Young eyes are always watching.,"So tonight on a 4 mile recovery run in 90 degree weather, I ran past 3 young girls (two were around 6 or 7 and one younger, around 4).

“I’m running” I replied with a big smile. She locked eyes with me and asked why. 
I had a moment to respond, without breaking a stride I said “ because it makes me feel good! I’m running 4 miles!” 
She was shocked and said “four miles!! Wow!” She was smiling as I ran away.

I don’t know it just felt so good. What if that small interaction sticks with her? If it makes her want to join a cross country or track team in school? Or pick up running when she is stressed in young adulthood?

66,1607543778.0,Thick Girl Runner Rant,"First things first, I (29F) am 5'5"" and about 170 lbs.  Large boobs, wide hips, and I got some stomach on me.  Overall, I look pretty proportional though.  Hourglass, just a little wider.  Wear a Large or a size 12 in most women's clothes.  (Just trying to paint the picture here lol)

I also eat very healthy.  Fresh foods only, everything home-cooked, never frozen processed foods, etc.  Mostly veggies because I love veggies.

This is the body I was given.  My weight doesn't really fluctuate.  I don't gain weight easily, nor do I lose it easily.  I've been a thick girl since puberty and because I run often and eat healthy, it doesn't seem like that will never change, which is fine with me.

I've been running for many years, somewhat inconsistently.  I might be consistent for 2 years before falling out of my routine for a few months.  Get back into the groove again and something eventually throws me off my game again.  Throughout all this, I still consider myself a RUNNER.  I love the sport and even if I'm out of a weekly routine, I still try to find time to run here and there.  3 miles minimum.

Because of the above things, people never really expect me to be a runner.  My body type doesn't fit the runner mold.  I don't post every run and race on instagram, which as everyone knows, is what truly makes it real \*eyeroll\*.  (No shade to people who do post all of their runs and races!  My problem is only the people who think if you DON'T post, then it didn't happen).

My fastest 5k was at an 8:02 (min/mile) pace.  I am aware that this isn't SUPER fast, but it's fast enough that I've placed in my age group in all of the 5Ks I've ever done.  I'm from a pretty small area so many of the 5Ks were fairly small, maybe only a couple hundred people attend.  I'm aware that in bigger cities, I would probably have a little more trouble placing.  But regardless, I still think an 8:00 to 8:30 5k pace is something to be proud of.

Anyways, my complaint is this.  Since my body doesn't fit everyone's vision of what a runner should look like, people love to assume I'm slow or new to running.  Or people think I'm lying when I mention that I got 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in my age group at whatever 5k.  If they don't make an actual comment about it, I can sometimes even see it in their eyes that they're skeptical.

Even worse, people who don't realize I've been running for most of my life sometimes put their foot in their mouth by saying something along the lines of ""have you started running to lose weight?"" ...No, why?  Should I be losing weight?  I think I look pretty damn fine, if you ask me.

After moving to a new city, I decided to join a running group.  The town I lived in previously didn't have such groups.  I showed up to my first group run and met everybody.  As we waited for everyone else to show up, a girl from the group said to me ""I'm in recovery mode, I'll be running slow so I can run with you.""  I just politely smiled, although I was quite offended.  What exactly makes this person, whom I met 3 minutes ago, think I plan on running ""slow""?  What makes her think that her ""recovery"" pace is equal to my comfortable pace?  I chalked it up as since it was my first time joining the group, maybe she assumed it was my first time running?  I don't know- but I still think about that little comment sometimes.

I am not negative towards my body.  I have a great figure that I love, but it's still upsetting to know that people make assumptions on what I can and can't do physically, which should not be the case.  Weight and health do not ALWAYS go hand-in-hand.

&#x200B;

Any other runners on the thicker side experience this kind of judgement?  How do you deal with it?

Thin-framed runners or even non-runners, do you find yourself judging others in this way?  Be honest, I would love to hear multiple opinions!

27, F, fat (but shrinking, ever-so-slowly)

In March, I picked up running because I simply couldn’t bear to sit inside my apartment any more while quarantining. And by running, I mean mostly walking while forcing myself to jog for a minute at a time, and occasionally bending over to hack up half a lung. 

I’m still not great now, but I run 3-4 times a week, averaging 3-4 miles each time. Still run/walk intervals, but more running than walking, and my pace has gone from about a 21:00 mile (hardly faster than walking) to about 16:00, although it dips closer to 13:00 when I’m really feeling myself. Nowhere near the elite folks you see in this sub, but a far cry from the kid who couldn’t run a full mile in high school.

When I started running, I laced up a clearance pair of Adidas I’d bought at Marshall’s months prior and tossed in my closet. They sucked - it felt like there was nothing between me and the pavement, which I hated, and they pinched my toes something awful - but the pain in my chest and legs was always worse, so I could tune it out. Not the case anymore; I can run long and steady enough that when I got a groove going, it would be my foot pain that would make me slow down, and it got to a point where it was unbearable for any longer.

So, despite being terrified of being judged for being a fatty in a running store, I sought out some help in finding a better pair at a local storefront, and the experience was gamechanging! It was so helpful, I learned a lot, and for the first time in about 6 months, I’m actually excited to run (rather than begrudgingly lacing up because I know it’s good for me). After trying on about 10 pairs - all of which fit better than my existing pair - I ended up leaving with a pair of amazingly comfy Hoka One One Bondi 7’s, and a pair of custom insoles - I couldn’t help but chuckle to myself realizing that I’d never believe it if you told me 5 years ago that I’d drop $230 at a running store. 

I went for a very easy run when I got home - just 2 miles, between 15:00 and 16:00 mile pace - and OH MY GOD. What??? I was faster without even trying? My stride feels longer? It actually felt like I was running on magical trampoline clouds? And best of all: my feet didn’t hurt at all!! I just wanted to keep going, which has never, ever happened; I felt like I was completely and totally jazzed - is this the mysterious runner’s high I keep hearing about? 

Thanks for reading my nonsense ramblings, but I’m just so happy and excited to actually enjoy running - is this what people go nuts about? Because I’m completely sold.",running

71,1615552305.0,If you're considering running. Go for it,"Running is NOT always fun. I used to watch runners and think ""how do they love running so much?"". The thing is, sometimes, runs are rubbish, they hurt, getting motivation to go isn't always easy, and at times the elements outside can knock you off course. I've been running for a couple of years now and am as self critical as when I first started.

That is why I have a MASSIVE amount of respect for ANYONE who runs. Especially those starting out, on their 1st week of couch to 5k etc. To put yourself out there takes bravery and courage. For some it will take a great effort just to quiet those inner voices of self doubt, worries about what others will think. Dont let those thoughts beat you.

When I first began running my back ached within the first minute, and I barely made it through my first run despite it being mostly walking. At the time I was also dealing with one of the toughest emotional times in my life. It is all too easy to get demotivated.

But I hopefully speak for all runners when I say that if you're getting out there, starting off on your running journey, no matter what you think you might look like, how unfit you think you are, what troubles you're dealing with, I personally think you are awesome and my message to you is DO NOT GIVE UP. You can do it!

Because I have not once got back from a run and regretted it. I've explored, got lost, discovered the wonders of nature (even locally) got muddy like a kid again, met some lovely people on the way, and feel really good and positive about life.

Its not always easy  everyone is on their own journey and life can be tough sometimes. But for anyone who's thinking of running, I say be kind to yourself, be brave and go for it.",running

Due, in large part, to the fact that I stopped running for a year when I was 20. After that, I got shin splints every time I tried to get back into it. 1 or 2 attempts a year. Shin splints every time. My body couldn't keep up with my mental game, and I'd run myself into the ground.

So when COVID hit, I decided to do something I always knew would fix it, but had a serious mental block against. Stubborn.In order to build my legs back up from a sedentary lifestyle, I walked. For 3 months, I went on a long walk 5 times a week.

My first run was in May.2 miles. I wanted to do more, but I was cautious. I limited myself to about 12 miles/week.Sometimes I'd run 3 miles, and even had some nice 4 milers. I'd just walk for a bit when I noticed my form breaking down. I'd get home from long runs feeling rough, but satisfied.

Today, I ran 3.55 miles with no walking, and experienced something that I forgot existed - or at least forgot how insanely powerful it could be.

It had been so long. I didn't even recognize it at first. I thought ""woah, easy there tiger, don't want to go up too high and crash"".

But the smile on my face just wouldn't go away. Then the realization of what was happening crashed over me like a wave. I almost cried happy tears mid stride, because I was experiencing a true, uninhibited runner's high for the first time **in over 7 years**.

The  feeling of pure freedom and oneness with the present moment was truly breathtaking.

I've gone through so much pain as an adult. Depression, alcoholism, suicidal ideation. The list goes on. All of that has honestly warped me as a person. As a kid, I never understood why adults always looked so....guarded. As an adult, I've often envied how kids look so....free - not bowed over with the weight of all their failures, not insulated from hurt by walls thicker than fort knox.

Today, I remembered how kids do it - how I used to do it. I ran home unashamed of the goofy smile plastered across my face.

I am so insanely grateful to be able to feel this again. I hope that you guys can appreciate your ability to run.

And if you're injured, or often get injured, take this bit of advice: the thing that might fix it is often the last thing you want to do. If I'd just taken 3 months to walk when I was 21, I'd probably never have forgotten what a runner's high feels like.",running
73,1629147775.0,I ran my first under-45min 5K today! How do y’all celebrate PRs?,"Super slow, I know (43:10), but it’s taken me forever to get to this point and I’m trying to be happy about this win. It’s hard for me to feel happy, that’s just how I’ve always been, but lately I’ve been trying to take more time to pay attention to wins.

What are some things you guys do to celebrate wins?

74,1586273112.0,Are there things you wish you knew before you started running? What are they? Here's my comprehensive list.,"Feel free to comment your best tips and advice guys. This is for the greater good of the running community. Let's compile our best personal advice, tips, insights and experiences. 

Here's a list of things I wish someone told me 4 years ago before i started running: 

1. Combining running and walking is an awesome way to build your endurance... ESPECIALLY at the BEGINNING of your running journey. 


2. Running consistently over weeks and months matter so much more in terms of improvements in racing performance rather than the specific paces and distances you run during ur training. The time on your feet will add up. You can literally keep using the same training schedule and not change the frequency, paces and distances for ur runs and you will still keep improving and getting fitter for another 4-8 weeks. 


3. It's better to take a week off from running to let a small injury or strain fix itself rather than running through it and end up not running for a month or few months because you made it worse.


4. Eat more, be in a slight calorie surplus, sleep well (deeply), drink a lot of water, take multivitamins and follow the protein guidelines for athletes, which is eating roughly 1.2-2 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. Do EVERYTHING you can to recover. 


5. Running is a high-impact sport, we'll need everything we can to help our bones and muscles to recover. I weigh 70 kilograms (154 lbs). That means each of my legs need to support  AT LEAST 70 kilograms (686 Newtons) of force every time they hit the ground and since I take 180 steps per minute during my runs, you can already tell that the strain experienced by our legs add up very quickly when we run. So it's very important that we do everything we can to recover. 


6. Fixing your running form as EARLY as you can is important to preventing injuries and becoming more efficient. If your feet land on your heels at each step, you'll be more prone to knee injuries. If your torso swings too much when you run, you'll wind up wasting too much energy. If your shoulders (trapezius specifically) are too tight, you'll be wasting energy too. Find a way to record yourself running on a treadmill, and get a coach, physio or an experienced runner to comment on your form and ask them for areas of improvement. 


7. If one of your legs is more powerful/stronger than the other and you're not careful enough, your stronger leg will be doing most of the work and taking most of the force when u run. This means that one leg will become more prone to getting injured. You can fix this by adding UNILATERAL (one-leg) leg exercises like lunges, step-ups and one-leg glute bridges to your routine which will help strengthen your weaker leg overtime and prevent a lot of muscle-imbalance related injuries. Not to mention strong quads = less knee pain. 


8. Core exercises like front planks, side planks and supermans prevent your torso from rotating or swinging too much while running. This will help you waste less energy and become more efficient when you run. (A strong core will also help fix most lower back pain problems) 


9. Dynamic stretches after every run increase the flexibility of your joints and also stops your muscles, tendons and joints from becoming too stiff. Helps prevents a lot of tightness-related injuries. 


10. Adding push-ups, pull-ups, rows and overhead presses will help you gain FUNCTIONAL strength and enough muscle to look ripped without slowing you down. If anything, we can argue that they're helpful to our running because these exercises actuallly indirectly train our core and other stabiliser muscles. 


11. Add cross-training. Mix up your training with some cycling, hiking, swimming, rowing or any endurance sport. You'll still get aerobic, endurance and stamina benefits from them because the physiological demands are similar. Keep in mind though, that if your focus is running, make sure most of your training revolves around running. 


12. You won't lose fitness by missing out on one session, but you will start to lose it after not running for two weeks in a row. 


13. Monitoring ur heart rate first thing in the morning is a good way to check if you've been overtraining or if you're about to get sick. If it's more than 10 beats per minute higher than your resting heart rate, feel free to take a day off 

14. If you didnt sleep well the night before, didnt eat well, drink enough water or felt really really stressed throughout the day... fell free to take the day off from running. 


15. Long-Distance runners still need to be decent at sprinting. If ur racing competitively, you wanna be the guy with the most devastating final sprint or 'kick' at the end of any race. It also looks cool and dramatic in a very very good and epic way.


16. Joining a running club or creating your own running group makes running so much more fun, relaxing and emnjoyable...


17. Unless if running is your designated personal alone time 😂

18. Running without music and just listening to ur footsteps, the wind, the birds and your environment is very therapeutic. 


19. If your goal is to run a specific time for a specifc distance, make sure that your training is specific to that goal. For example, let's say you're goal is to run a 5k in 25 minutes. 


You're training should focus on: 


- Becoming comfortable with running for 25 minutes at a time on a regular basis


- Becoming comfortable with running at 5:00/km which is the pace you need to break 25 minutes for 5k 


In this case you're training schedule can look like 


Mon:   30 minute run (easy-moderate pace)
Wed:   30 minute run (easy-moderate pace)
Sat  :   Warm-up jog + 5x 1km intervals at 5:00/km pace with 5 minutes rest in between


You can rest or add cross training on the four other days of the week. 


For the Saturday interval session, try to slowly shorten your rest periods between intervals as you get fitter. Maybe take 4 minutes 30 seconds rest next week, and then only 4 minutes the week after. 


TRAIN HARD but TRAIN SMARTER 


That's all. I love this sport and our community. I've become much faster and smarter than I was 4 years ago. I've had drawbacks. I couldnt run in 2019 because of an injury. But I'm glad I can save you guys time by sharing these lessons I've learnt along the way. 

I've gone from dying after running for 200 metres (March 2016) to running an 18:05 5k in October 2018 (17 years old). I'm probably in sub 18-shape now (19 years old), started running again from scratch on December last year. But eventually I want to see how fast I can get before the 2032 Olymp...😉

75,1653352512.0,I feel like I unlocked a running secret for myself!,"I'm currently overweight and like to run for exercise. In the past, I always tried to run a mile and then promptly quit after one mile and obsessively looked at my fitibit while running to see how close I was to a mile the entire time.

For whatever reason after picking up running again last week, I decided to put my Playlist on shuffle and run for 5 songs instead of a mile.

Every single time now I always run a little over a mile and this method has helped me so much! As I get more fit, I hope to eventually up it to 10 songs!",running
76,1600558593.0,"(21f) Constantly harassed on runs, what to do?","Haven’t ran in a few days and currently eating sweet tarts sitting on my lazy ass. I live in TX and run in leggings and a sports bra. It seems every time I run some man or group of men (usually landscapers) will do the extreme. Howl, yell, honk, etc. 

The worst experience I had was landscapers run and chase me from the other side of the street while yelping. Disgusting. Made me want to throw up and was scared. I’m not confrontational esp against 15 men or men inside their big ol trucks but on the inside I’m crying. 

I have too much anxiety to go out. It’s not just running, it happens when I walk my dog or anytime I’m not with my SO. SO doesn’t understand the depth of it since he’s never been cat called. 

Truth be told when I was fat and depressed a year back, I got less attention. So my child brain is thinking how to look disgusting as possible to not attract any attention? The adult brain is here asking for advice that’s non treadmill related. 


Thank you.",running
77,1599084018.0,37F here - a rando dude made my night run,"I live in a big city and I like to run alone at night. I find I don’t get harassed nearly as much at night simply because there are fewer people around to do the harassing. Plus, night runs were my salvation during hottest part of this bizarre pandemic summer. Running through the dark city makes my world feel a little bigger and my problems feel a little smaller. 

I was out for a run and saw another runner, a pretty big man, coming towards me. I’ve never had issues with fellow runners so I wasn’t nervous, but I try to keep my wits about me whenever any unknown person is approaching and I’m aIone. 

As he passed, he quietly gestured 🤙 and ran on. 

It was the absolute perfect way to say “fuck yeah, nice job” — the perfect way to acknowledge me without making me feel weird or second guess the interaction. I didn’t feel intruded upon, hit on, or pressured to respond. I felt seen in a way that didn’t make me feel vulnerable. I smiled for the rest of my run. 

Thanks man. 🤙",running

80,1601574307.0,Please don’t take for granted being able to run,"Hi guys! 

My name is Jacob, I’m a 21 year old guy in the prime of my life. Or so I thought. I was running a lot back when this pandemic started, upwards of doing 50-60 miles a week and absolutely loving it. I did cross country in high school and always had a knack for running. I would do half marathons for fun just by myself and I was so excited to use this pandemic as a time to improve even more. 

But then... I got pleurisy. Basically what pleurisy is is the muscles along the inside of your lungs get inflamed and it’s really painful/hard to get a deep breath, which of course halted my running. This happened back in June I was diagnosed. So I haven’t been able to run since June with serious lung issues. 

And now it is fall, the perfect running weather and no better time to get the shoes on and hit the road. My lungs are feeling a little better and I thought it would be time to ease back into running. Nope.

I sustained a concussion last week and am out for at least another few weeks until I can even think about running. 

So please, don’t take for granted being able to run. Enjoy it while you can because I’m jealous of all you guys who can run during this gorgeous fall weather. 

Thanks for reading this far :) 

Tl/dr: got pleurisy in June, a lung issue which stopped me from running. When I started to feel better I got a concussion. Don’t know if I can run at all the rest of the fall. Please, enjoy your runs for me.

Any one else here struggle with this? Is there any advice for a larger runner to improve form and performance over time?

84,1622869321.0,I ran with out a shirt for the first time,"Now I know this might not be a big deal for some but to me it is. I have always struggled with my weight and have been self conscious about my body. I always hated going to pool parties as a kid or even going to the beach. Today I was on my run and it was super humid and I was sweating more than usual I have had problems with nipple irritation (man here by the way) so I generally always wear bandages over my nipples to help today they kept falling off and I was in tremendous pain. I stopped around 4 miles in my 11 mile run and came to a decision point. Call my wife and tell her to come get me or run without a shirt for the first time ever. I don’t know if it was the music or how I was feeling or if it because I am training for a marathon and I don’t know what is going to happen on race day but I should be prepared. So I took my shirt off tucked it in my shorts and went on for the next 7 miles with out it. It was such a freeing experience I really didn’t care what people thought of me or my body. I am proud of the weight I have lost and how I look. If they don’t like it that’s their problem not mine. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.

87,1609423771.0,A hawk grabbed my head while I was running and now I’m scared to go back out there,"I was running early in the morning like I’ve done for years. I had on a day glo yellow beanie and a headlamp (but the headlamp was turned off because I was on a well lit neighborhood street). 
As I was running on the sidewalk I felt a big whack/scrape on my head and it took me a few moments to figure out it was a hawk. He swooped, tried to grab my head, then flew back up before landing on some nearby telephone wires. 
Needless to say I screamed my head off and ran as fast as I could. I turned my headlamp up to the sky and turned it on but still felt pretty freaked out. 
I’m not hurt at all, the beanie is pretty thick. I’m also totally aware of how ridiculous this story is. 

But that being said I can’t help but be nervous about getting back out there! I’m afraid to wear my day glo bean which has been keeping me warm on these cold runs. 
I can’t understand why the hawk went for my head. Anyone have any ideas?

89,1407278621.0,An interesting coincidence between Kilometres and Miles,"Okay, bear with me, this involves some math:

The Fibonacci Sequence, for those who don't know, is this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, .... Starting with 1, the two neighboring numbers added up equal the next number. One interesting aspect of these numbers is that their ratios all approach being what is called the golden ratio, 1.618....

So, for example, 3/2 is 1.5, 5/3 is 1.666, 8/5 is 1.6, 13/8 is 1.625, 21/13 is 1.615, 34/21 is 1.619, etc.

So what does this have to do with kilometres to miles? Well, the ratio of km to mi is 1.609 to 1. Since 1.609 is so close to the golden ratio, you can use the Fibonacci numbers to convert between kilometres and miles! For example, 5 km is quite close to 3 miles (3.1 mi). 8 km is almost exactly 5 miles, 13 km is 8 miles, 21 km is 13 miles, etc! I think this is awesome.

90,1587992806.0,I just want say I'm here for the slow runners!,"I've been seriously contempalting running a marathon the last six months or so. 

I've always thought of the running community as supportive, but I've been doing lots of research and forum reading regarding marathons and found so many runners up their butts about slow runners.

I've seen lots of horrible comments: 
• How anyone under six hours is walking (walking marathon distance in six hours or even eight hours is bloody impressive!)
• How slow runners waddle (wtf? I feel like its a choice of words to deliberately imply slow runners are fat)
• Slow runners don't deserve to be in marathons (if marathons are only about running fast, why isn't everyone competing for the win)
• Slow runners don't train as hard (everyone has different training methods, slow and fast. I know some fast runners who train twice a week, I know slow runners who train daily)
• Slow runners should be shot/decapitated to encourage them to speed up (I get this is a joke but really?!)
• Slow runners are fat f*cks (slow =/= fat, even if a slow runner is fat who cares, and if you get that offended by fat people you have bigger problems)

I just really don't get it, and I'm really disappointed in some of the running community.

What do they gain from belittling slow runners? The pace of slow runners does not invalidate the pace of fast runners. It doesn't make it shameful to be a runner if some other runners do it slowly. It doesnt make faster runners better.

~~

On a personal level: 

My target time would be about six hours. That's a slow time, around when most marathons cut off. But I think its still pretty cool.

But I also understand there will be people who are aiming for lower times, or achieve them accidentally, and that's cool too. 26 miles is a feat whatever way you put it and anyone competing will need to train hard -  walking or running - which should be respected.

People might run slow for various reasons - physical impairment, disability, hot weather slowing them down, race not going as planned (injury, bad day, dehydration, headache etc), people who want to power walk it.

As a community I don't think we should ever belittle anyone trying to take on exercise. As a society we really need to do more of it and we should always encourage any sort of exercise - even if it's someone walking a marathon.

I agree that there should be cut offs because you can't close roads forever and marshalls have places they want to be too, and I think there should be a certain level of minimum fitness in place for most marathons (because its a big challenge and you'll only injure yourself if you don't have some level of fitness). But otherwise I don't see a problem with cutoffs of seven or eight hours.

Anyway, I just want to rep for the slow runners. Keep doing what you're doing, keep pursuing fitness, keep running your snail pace cos you're doing great!

92,1594050390.0,Ran my first 5K!!!,"I just did it! My first one, without walking or stopping! Oh how I wished I could do it three months ago but doubted that I could! Now, it’s done!

I’m 44M. About a year ago I was overweight, had finally enough. Went on a diet, primarily CICO. In 8 months I dropped 30 pounds and hit 20% body fat. About 4 months in, started lifting weights to maintain some muscle. 

When the pandemic hit, I stopped going to the gym and instead started running. Boy was I out of shape! Couldn’t run three minutes without wheezing and doubling over, after years of neglect. Then I started reading this sub. Thank you all the kind strangers generously sharing their advice and the newbies posting their milestones. Between the directions and the inspiration, I’ve kept at it. And just ran my first 5K in 36:10! 

For those who may find something to follow here, here are my lessons learned:

1) ok, it’s a cliche but it’s true: run slow. Slower than you think. And slower than that! When I first started, I was trying 7 mph. That was too fast for me. I finally found my stride down at 4.8! 

2) then keep at slow for weeks!  This was hard, I wanted to go fast. And I sure thought two weeks and 8 sessions was enough 😂. About two and a half weeks in, I went for 50 minutes. It felt ok at the time, but the next week was brutal. I was sore, my knees ached. I clearly wasn’t ready and lost about a week as I recovered.

3) run frequently but allow yourself to recover. I listened to my body, if I didn’t feel right, I skipped a day. Mostly, I ran every other day. Most of my runs were 20-30 minutes, and my longer ones 40-45 minutes. I ran the long ones once a week and rested two days afterwards

4) keep at it. It took me about 8 weeks to truly feel comfortable. But I got there. Your body needs time to adjust especially if you have been out of shape. Years of neglect doesn’t get fixed in a couple weeks. Heck, maybe not even in a couple months. But you do start seeing progress quickly enough. I could climb a flight of stairs without running out of breath, started not to sweat until 10 minutes into my runs, and my heart rate started declining! Slowly but surely.

Well, I think that’s it! If this out of shape middle aged man can do it, so can you! If you need one last push to get you started, I hope this is it. Go get your shoes on and start running.

This was my first ever half marathon. As far as races go, I've done a couple 5ks and a marathon relay where I ran 6.7 miles on my leg. As the title mentions, I used to be almost 400lbs, progress pic here - http://imgur.com/gallery/uYiS1xm

As I dropped weight, I gave running a try, started couch to 5k and fell in love with running since it was something I never ever thought I'd be able to do.

I worked my way up to the 5k, and then gradually got to 10k and stayed there for awhile. I didn't think I'd go further than that but I started feeling better on longer runs, finding more runners online, discovering the ten junk miles podcast, and I've decided my ultimate goal is to become an ultra marathon runner. This half is my first stepping stone.

**Prep**

I looked at like 5 different training plans, tried doing the zen labs one since I used that for couch to 5k, but I didn't like the start/stop method they used. I just wanted to run miles. So I found one I liked and I kinda modified it. I work 50 hours a week and have 3 kids so I had to find a plan that wasn't too time intensive. I would run 3 times a week, 2 runs between 4-6 miles, and my long run would increase by a mile each week until I got the 13. I would bike to work sometimes for cross training, and my job is super active so I often would be at 20-30,000 daily steps.

Training plan worked great! I had to stop myself on the last two weeks, once I got to 11 miles I reallllly just wanted to add those two miles but I figured I'd save myself for a special occasion 😉.

**Race Day**

I set 6 alarms from 430-515am. The shuttles across the street from the hotel left at 5-6am to take us to the Fargo dome. I wanted to get up early enough to complete my morning dooties and be early to take it all in. I didn't want to believe the weather reports but sure enough. Pouring rain and 40 degrees. I typically love running in the rain, it's a spiritual experience for me. It makes me feel unstoppable, EFF YOU MOTHER NATURE YOU CAN'T STOP ME!! Buuut typically it's warmer.. And it starts when I'm about two miles into my run. I went back and forth between my thermal 2.0 baselayer and just a long sleeve dryfit, I settled on the thermal with my run the year 2019 challenge dryfit tee-shirt. Shorts with thermal leggings, my underarmor face mask which I took off about mile two, and my big winter gloves. Since loosing weight, I get cold all the time now.. But especially my hands. I have super wimpy hands now. I have to wear gloves in anything under 50 degrees or they just get so cold.

I board the shuttle and start walking around the Fargo Dome. So many people! It's awesome! I meet a guy I met on instragram and that was pretty cool, do some stretching, more morning dooties and before I know it it's time to line up!

I start making my way down the race shoot. The Fargo marathon starts and ends inside the Fargo Dome, which is a big event center. There are thousands of people lined up so I make my way to about the middle of the pack, a little past the 2:30 pacer. The race starts and the line slowly starts to move! We run out of the dome being cheered on by about a thousand people which is super freaking cool, and directly outside into pouring rain, oh and suprise the wind picked up too! NOT TODAY SATAN! I hate treadmill running, so I was one of the crazy people out in sub zero weather getting my miles in. This was nothing compared to those conditions ☺

We looped around the Fargo dome and starting getting into residential areas. Miles 1-4 we winded around some streets which helped with the wind since we weren't going the same direction for long. They had live bands playing under tents and in garages along the whole way. Super cool! I'm sure if the weather was nicer there would have been more, but there was a few hundred people along the way cheering everyone on and giving high fives which I absolutely loved!

5-8 miles we went down some underpasses and looped around some more residential areas. I felt like I was going slower than I normally do but my strava said I was at a faster pace that I was during training. I felt just fine so I kept it up! I took my first gu around mile 7. I didn't feel like I needed it, but I wanted to make sure I didn't change too much from my training and that's when I usually took it. Grabbed my first drink around mile 8 as well. It's still raining and windy, but I didn't even notice at this point.

Past mile 8 we run down Broadway which is a historical street in downtown Fargo, more people, more bands and the atmosphere is just awesome! Mile 9 and 10 I start feeling a but sluggish. I pop my other gu and find another drink at the next station. I never once thought about dropping, I even told myself heck even if I have to walk the rest of the way I'm finishing. I felt super slow but then strava said I was at a 12:00 pace.. Which was normal during my training so I was like well heck let's go!

The last few miles seemed to take forever, but I kept trucking along. I texted my wife who had been waiting in the dome with our children that I was almost there. Finally we turned a street and I could see the Fargo dome! So close! I tried picking up the pace a bit but legs weren't having it. Until I turned the last corner to go through the tunnel and saw the finish line. I felt full of energy and like I just started the run fresh. I basically dead sprinted, passed 4 people and barreled through the finish line! I DID IT!! I almost started crying but I wanted to find my family so focusing on that helped. I got my medal, pushed through all the food lines and gave my kids and wife a big hug!! (to which my oldest replied, Daddy you are soaked!!) I forgot all about being wet and the conditions, but heyI FREAKING DID IT!

We all celebrated and we went to the local donut shop for a victory donut afterwards!

My next goal is to hopefully run the full marathon in September in Bismarck. I'm hoping I can continue my training plan I used for the half, keeping my two shorter runs and increasing the long run by a mile each week. Should bring me to the end of August/early September and ready to rock out the 26.2 miles!!

So excited to keep going, I might find a race or two in between for training. Dropping more weight between there is going to help tons, as well as more milage! I feel I can definitely break the 2:30 mark next time I run a half ☺

I did get kinda discouraged looking at the results, I finished about 75%, so hey not last! I got over it pretty quickly, I reminded myself how far I've come and hey I've only been running 3 years! Just gotta keep at it and rack up the medal count! It'll all come in due time!",running
94,1583864864.0,I started running a year ago because people told me my dog was fat...,"This time last year I got very tired of hearing people tell me I had a fat dog (he was 77 pounds and ideally would look best at 65-67 pounds, according to the vet). I am a very anxious person and guilt was born before I was, so basically my brain thought that if people thought my dog was fat that meant that I don't exercise him enough and I'm a terrible dog mom. The more I reacted when people told me the more they said it (jokingly, but still - behind every joke is a little truth). 

Wanting to do better by him I decided to start running. We lived in a one bedroom apartment so to exercise him more meant I needed to exercise myself more, too. I originally had a goal in mind of running a marathon by the time I was 26 (I started running on my 25th birthday) and that my dog was going to be my training buddy. Well my birthday is tomorrow and I will be 26 and while im not quite ready for a marathon, I am signed up to do a half marathon in May and my dog and i go for a 10 mile run every Saturday.  

For the first few months I ran 7 days a week. I never worried about how long I was running, just that I did it, so some days I ran one or two miles, others I ran five. (I didnt take him on all my runs because 7 days a week is excessive and I wanted him to have rest days too, even if I wasnt giving them to myself). 

Interestingly, my endurance was getting way better and my dog's was not. He was starting to get super tired after about 2 miles so I brought him to the vet and explained the situation. His weight was increasing, he was getting tired easily and I wanted his thyroid checked. She didnt see any immediate warning signs that something is wrong but she did a blood test anyway and found out that he had anaplasmosis, a rare blood infection from a tick (that isnt protected against flea and tick meds that he gets regularly) and it was slowing his metabolism down and draining his energy. I likely would not have realized the difference if I wasn't running with him several times a week. I feel like I knew his behaviors better and just knew him better from running together, as silly as that sounds. 

Flash forward several months, hes doing tippy taps at the door waiting to go on a trail run, hes down to 67 pounds, I went from 177 to 157, size 12 to a size 8 and we are both so much happier! We run 3 or 4 times a week and he gets to run with me off leash in the woods near our house (we moved into a house with a yard in August). When the weather is bad and I run on the treadmill in the basement he aggressively chews his toys next to me, not quite sure what his role is but happy to be part of it. Honestly, running has made me so much better. Happier, more confident, driven, and a better dog mom. I don't feel (as) guilty anymore because he has a pretty damn good life and I made that happen for him. 

I'm hoping this doesnt read like a rant, this is just the first time I've set my mind to something challenging and I feel like I've accomplished it and I've done better for my dog in the process.

95,1599270977.0,"Holy crap, please learn about “exercise-induced anaphylaxis”","So there I was, going for my typical, non-strenuous, flat 5-mile run in beautiful 70-degree weather. I was hydrated and had eaten my usual breakfast a couple hours prior. About a half-mile in, I notice my palms are bright red and super itchy. I had just treated our hot tub prior to leaving, so I figured maybe I had gotten some of the chemicals on my hands or something. Another half mile in, I start getting something resembling gas pains in my stomach. Weird, I think to myself, but figure it’s just a quick run and it’ll pass. I continued for more than a mile and a half as the pain kept growing and growing. Finally I had to stop and walk the last mile—the longest mile of my life as I was now shaking, lethargic, and experiencing tingling in my hands and face—not to mention the now extreme abdominal pain. I ended up basically collapsing on my porch swing—my partner ran out to help and said my lips were blue. I was disoriented and had trouble opening and closing my hands. I wouldn’t let him take me to the ER (wasn’t really thinking clearly, should have gone) but symptoms resolved after about 20 minutes of him giving me water and putting ice on my neck. I was freaked out enough to go to Urgent Care and their diagnosis was “Exercise-induced anaphylaxis” which is a sudden allergic reaction to freaking exercise! Most commonly happens to women runners, and may strike once or twice and never again—but it can actually be fatal. The worst thing you can do is to try to push through the pain as I did—had I stopped immediately it probably wouldn’t have gotten so scary.

97,1598368321.0,upsetting encounter with a Karen on my run,"I (17 F) was on my run this morning when I had a very irritating experience.

Because of covid, whenever I pass someone, I step off of the sidewalk and a bit into the road, just to make sure people have plenty of space because I don't wear a mask when I run. The last thing I want to do is make people uncomfortable. People usually wave and say thank you or good morning. But one particular woman was NOT having it. She was on the sidewalk, coming up the street while I was going down. I did what I usually do, kept my distance and headed out into the road (safely). As I approached her, she forcefully pointed away from her. I assumed she needed even more space so I stopped and waited for some cars to pass before I headed out farther into the road. Then she lost it, and screamed ""CROSS THE F\*\*\*ING ROAD!!"" I was absolutely stunned, and crossed. Technically, she was on the wrong side of the road, I was on the correct side and she made me cross onto the wrong side. If she didn't want to cross, she could have moved onto the grass on the other side of the sidewalk if she felt that she needed more space. She also **wasn't wearing a mask**. I didn't care that she wasn't wearing a mask, because we had plenty of space between us. But if you're that uncomfortable being around people who are 6 feet away from you, you should at least wear a mask. I also think it's wrong that she swore at me. I'm 17, but she has no idea how old I am. I didn't think I deserved that. I was very upset and on the verge of tears for the rest of my run. :(

So a guy runs in the Boston Marathon, things don't go quite as well as he had wanted to. When he finishes, he snags a second medal because he felt his wife ""deserved"" one for supporting him in his training. Puts it up on social media, and as expected, outrage ensues.

102,1605713549.0,Running is saving my life,"Recovering alcoholic here (and 15 year smoker) with 3 weeks sober/no smoking this Saturday. Not a terribly long time, but its something! 

I picked up running over the summer and did my first 10k trail run in September. I was surprised I even finished because my ""training"" was not even close to being consistent due to my drinking and smoking habits.

Running has helped me tremendously in staying sober. Not only is it my healthy new hobby, but I know that if I want to improve my distance/speed and if I want to be able to have a good run tomorrow, I won't be able to drink. 

Since I'm giving sobriety a go, im training for a half marathon in February! I've done really well these past couple of weeks and finally got my average mile down to 11:30 on my long runs, which right now is about 7 miles.

I had my first ""bad"" run today. It was supposed to be my long run (aimed for 8-9 miles), but only made it 3. I knew it was bound to happen as every run these past 3 weeks have been great, but its still discouraging. 

Really not much of a point to my post- just ranting lol! I really feel like running is saving my life and giving me something positive to look forward to instead of looking forward to my next drink.

103,1600778643.0,Running has Changed My Life,"6 years ago, I was a fat piece of crap.  I'm 5'7 and back then I was pushing 300 pounds.  I was a regular smoker, and I drank more than I should.  I was most definitely on a path to an avoidable premature death.  I was depressed, and didn't care to or believe I could change.

Fast forward to last week, I'm meeting with my new primary care physician after moving.  155 lbs.  ""Perfect"" blood pressure.  I just got my lab results back and literally everything from my bloodwork is in a healthy range.  To top it off, when he checked my heart rate, my doctor said ""Your resting heart rate is good.  Really good.   Are you a runner?""  The word ""Wow"" was used.  I had not discussed running or any exercise at that point. I was (still am) beaming.

What changed?  I assume you know where this is going.  I started hitting the gym.  Eventually I gravitated from the weight room and the elliptical to the treadmill and the trails.  Currently I hover around 50ish miles per week - I've lost the weight, kept it off, quit the cigs, and I can be honest with myself when I say I'm unwinding on the weekend and enjoy the taste of a good porter, rather than getting blasted because I feel like doing nothing else.

Running has cured me, physically and mentally.   It went from a joy to a passion.  I have a hobby that is good for me, that I can look forward to.  Now, I think I've created the opposite problem - I'm addicted.  Possibly unhealthily so.  But I can learn again to moderate. 

Can I still improve?  Of course I can.  That's another thing I love about running - there's always room for improvement. I should still cut back on the booze, and quite frankly my diet is shit.  But that's not the point.  My quality of life is dramatically better, and I have running to thank.

Admittedly, this is a rather self aggrandizing post.  I'd like to think I can offer encouragement though.  I have friends and loved ones struggling with a myriad of issues, physically and emotionally (I think we all do), and my experience helps me sympathize with and encourage them.

What about you, runnit?  What's your story?  How has running helped change your life?

Since recovering from the coronavirus, I ran my first 10 mile run ever. For some context, prior to covid, my longest run was 8.5 miles and I was running at the most 20 miles per week. I didn't even set out to run 10 miles today, but the weather was about 15 degrees cooler than it's been, and it was the most perfect day. I was training for the Broad Street Run in Philadelphia, which got canceled and went virtual due to Covid. When I tested positive for Covid in April, I was devastated and I had to sit out running for 3 months. But in July, I started running again. First, just very short runs, with lots of rest in between. Then little by little, I did my first 5k since recovering, then a 10k, then a 7.5 miler. For whatever reason, today, the run just felt easy. The wind was perfect and I decided to do an awesome running route, and then it just turned into 10 miles!

106,1598305369.0,"Self-proclaimed ""slow runner"" finally broke 30:00 in the 5k","I started running with Couch to 5k when I was in middle school, because I was tired of not being able to run down the block. I was slow, but I improved my endurance to the point where I could run for three hours (11.5 miles, but still). It was frustrating to be passed by run-walkers during the local 5k, but I was proud to finish: 12:51 pace! I adopted the identity of a ""slow runner"" and doubted that I'd ever break 30:00.

I joined cross country my freshman year of high school and ran an average of 11:22 for a 2.8 mile course. The next year, my PR was a 5k at 11:41 pace. That was my last season of XC, thought I kept myself moving with road biking and rowing.

Two years later, in the fall of 2017, I averaged 10:52 for a local 5k. Two years after *that*, after walking onto my college's rowing team, I averaged 10:02 for a 5k (PR'ed during a 4 mile run). When crew got cancelled this spring, I applied the intensity it had taught me to running. The past few months, I've PR'ed multiple times in the mile, 5k, 10k, and half marathon, and I even ran my longest run (20 miles!).

Today, in 65 **°** F and 95% humidity, I broke 30! I huffed and puffed my way to a 29:39 5k (average 9:33), knocking almost 50 seconds off my previous PR from early June. I keep seeing people running at my pace on Strava, and it's starting to sink in that while I'm not winning races against anyone else, I'm not so much of a ""slow runner"" anymore.

So for my fellow ""slow runners"" -- stick with it! It took me 7 years, but I finally achieved something I thought I just wasn't cut out to do. The key was learning to push myself. Collegiate rowing raised the bar for the kind of discomfort my mind and body can sustain. From 2013-2017, I was running hard on race day, but I wasn't training hard enough throughout the week. (I used to run the same 4 mile route every day at around the same pace! No wonder I broke up with running for a few months in eighth grade.) Lately, I've been pushing myself to hold moderate pace for 4 and 5 mile runs (that's 11:00 miles for me), and I've thrown in some track workouts (1 minute sprints or 400m repeats) to spice things up. It keeps things interesting, and it's making me faster!

Now what? Should I give myself another 7 years to break 25:00? ;)

Edit: Thanks for all the awards and kind words! I want to add a few things. 

I agree that there's nothing wrong with running slowly! My line of thinking is that slow runners should be celebrated for pushing themselves just as hard as fast runners over the same distance, but for, like, twice as long. For me, it's always been about beating my previous records, not anyone else's. 

Stories of new runners chopping their times in half in just a few months weren't encouraging to me when I'd been running for years and had never seen such quick progress. I wrote this for those of us who are chipping away, slowly and steadily, at our current times. 

And sorry for the km/mile confusion! Here in the US, 5k and 10k are commonly used distances, while we rely on min/mile for pace. My races weren't all exactly the same distance, so I wrote pace instead of total time. ",running

I hope I can be selected in the sweepstakes to run one of the majors, either Berlin or Chicago. This sport has given me a second shot in life and I am grateful I can be a part of the running family.

**Background**

I've played various sports (mainly Football/Soccer and Aussie rules) most of my life (28M/173cm/74kgs/AUS) but I've always relied on my short distance running and always hated the idea of running non-stop for more than 5 minutes. People would say I was ""fit"" because of all the sports I love playing whether its a pick up game of indoor or a proper outdoor game. However I always held a belief that I wasn't truly fit though because I couldn't/wouldn't push myself to run to improve my fitness.

I didn't play outdoor football in 2019 because I wasn't enjoying it so I basically did no exercise whatsoever until September when I realised I needed to get back into gym. I had always liked the idea of doing a C25K program but I had not completed it at least 5 times but I tried again last October, lasted 3 weeks before I stopped and stuck with weight training because gains is life.

I had made the decision to get back to play outdoor again for 2020 (due to heaps of persistence from my old teammates) and got stuck into preseason and boy, I was blowing out of my ass real easily. Enter COVID in March and the ensuing lockdowns that we all partook in obviously put my return to a sudden halt. I thought, I literally have no excuse to not work on my fitness anymore so I found a C210K program on an app and completed that in 8-10 weeks. Getting through all the milestones of going from walk run intervals to being able to run for 40 minutes straight in week 7 is still one of my biggest highlights. By the end of that program, I ran 10K in 1:02:46 which I was 50/50 about as I was aiming to crack under an 1hr but ecstatic that I ran 10K straight with no walking.

&#x200B;

**Training**

My mate and I were both hooked on running (he is doing a separate program written up by his physio because he got shin splints from running too much too early) so I was looking for what to do next whether a 10K program or a HM program. Started going through this subreddit and came across a few posts mentioning u/free_running-plans and his plans on his website so I had a look, liked what I saw and downloaded the HM program. I got 3 weeks into it and then Melbourne decided to enter a second wave of COVID infections and we were placed into Stage 4 lockdown where we are only allowed 1 hour of outdoor exercise a day. Seeing as my long runs on Saturday were close to an hour for 6 miles, I knew the added miles in the following weeks would push me way past my hour so I made the decision to drop to the 10K program.

I followed the plan as best as possible as it was set out in a way that was easy to understand. The intervals were heaps of fun as it was a great change up from regular running. The week 4 5K TT arrived and I was nervous if I could actually run it under 30 mins as my PR at the time was 30:50 but I had a bit of confidence due to the fact I ran a 2 mile easy run balls out by mistake in 18 mins. That 5KTT was completed in 27:15, I was spent but over the moon with that time. 

I think from there, that TT gave me the full confidence in the program and in myself as a runner. The biggest ""OH"" moment though came when I was finally able to get an answer about what the difference between an easy pace and tempo pace as I was always confused by the answers online. Once I got my answer in week 5, I realised I had been running my easy runs at 6:10 min/k when I should have been running them at 6:50-7:20 min/k lol

The drop in pace made a massive difference and for the first time ever, I was enjoying my long runs on the Sat mornings (I run at 5pm during the week) when previously I had always had my least enjoyable runs on Sat mornings. By workout 7B (4x1 mile with 4 min recovery), I was confident I could beat 1hr for my 10K. 

I ran my 10K TT yesterday in the same 3.5K walking path I've walked basically everyday since mid March. 

I got my Spotify playlist optimised with some absolute tunes for the last 20 mins of the run, tried to eat lunch which I didn't finish due to nerves (i've never been able to eat much before a game due to nerves). 

The first 2 kms were fine as they were a bit quicker the my tempo pace, the hardest part of my run were splits 3-6 where I felt I was unable to get into a rhythm or actually try and maintain a negative split (btw I decided to do negative splits for the first time ever on this run, just more overthinking for myself haha). By the 7th and 8th split, I had got comfortable as I was over the hump and I knew that I could run this out. The 9th split started well but I clearly died in the ass by the end as my legs were getting even heavier. I made a decision in my last split to run balls to the wall and it hurt but I knew that if I did I might be able to beat my great outcome goal of 58 mins. Seeing under 57 mins on watch made my legless walk home feel amazing. 

&#x200B;

**Take away**

* Even if you think your easy pace is easy and you've been able to maintain conversations with your running mate, run even slower! I can't begin to tell you how much more enjoyable my long runs have become!
* You do you! I see a lot of people running on the same track as me and my pace is clearly below average as most people run past me but I know that I'm competing only against myself from yesterday.
* Thanks to the worst lockdowns since WW2, I have gone from not being able to run more than 5 mins straight to running 10K in under 57 minutes in 6 months and running has become something I really love doing.
* This subreddit has a lot of gold and I've picked up little tips and advice by searching for answers in this sub, so thank you everyone!
* Definitely give u/free_running-plans and his [website](https://freerunningplans.com/) a look, I highly recommend it!

Now that it is spring, I'm leaning towards doing the HM program next now that we roadmap to reopen Melbourne but I might give myself a week of recovery easy runs before I start the new program.

117,1530457133.0,I broke the 40min mark on a 5K for the first time today!,"I have fibromyalgia. I started running again more seriously and more regularly back in September last year. I am running a 5K with work colleagues next week and I put myself in the 45min group because I decided that it was a reasonable objective considering my shape at the time. I posted here [a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/7kegcx/tips_to_build_my_base/) as I was still working on being able to do 20min in a row on the treadmill. At the time, doing half an hour on the treadmill, I was walking/running a total of about 2.5km.

I ran my first 5K to have a baseline and see how much work I needed to do to reach under 45min on the day of the race on May 8th. It took me 46:30 to complete the 5K.

I gradually started running longer and longer, occasionally adding 2.5-3km runs to do some speed work. Nowadays most of my “workout” runs are 4km.

On June 19th, I did another 5K to see if my speed work and longer distance “normal” runs had helped. I finished in 42:26! I was stoked.

Recently I started doing a bit more work on my speed by using a metronome to increase my step count during my first km of running in every workout.

Today, one week before the race, I did another practice 5K and I [finished it in 38:28](https://imgur.com/a/rUocUoY). I can’t believe how far I’ve come!

I was always that slow kid everyone would mock and tease by stealing their stuff and run away with it when I was in primary school. I can officially say that I’m no longer that kid. Even with fibromyalgia, a little tenacity and some humility has paid off greatly in making me feel more comfortable in my own body.

Thank you to everyone who gave me recommendation and encouragement in my last post. I really feel happy about being part of this community.

I was out for a late evening 9k run like 2 hours ago in dark Sweden and i was about 3km in on my run. I was running on asphalt in my town and i got around a corner and what do i see...a calf and a mother moose like 50m away. I stopped and just started walking backwards slowly out of shock and the mother was looking at me and then she started running towards me. I panicked and started running the otehr way. I felt the adrenaline pumping and i´ve never run this fast in my entire life and i´m quite fast on a normal day. Been playing football my entire life. I looked back as there she was closing in and thought i was gonna die but then an old man came to the rescue in his pickup truck. He obviously saw me running for my life and the moose so he started flashing his lights while honking and he somehow scared the moose away, thank god.

I still ran past him and i didn´t stop for another 300m. He then found me down the road and we talked it out and i thanked him for rescuing me and he also drove me home(i knew who  the old man was from before).
At the moment i don´t think i want to go out running in the dark ever again.

There is no one ""good"" pace for a certain distance. It all depends on your fitness level, how long you've been running, your age, your local competition, if it's hot or cold, if it's hilly, if you've tapered and properly fueled and hydrated, etc. And things change. You get older, you get injured, you take a break, etc, and someday, even your own PRs will seem impossible.                      

The only time pace *really* matters is if you're doing this for money and/or in the Olympics or trying to qualify. In which case you'd be over in /r/advancedrunning anyway.

It's not race day.  There were no personal bests.  No achievements.  No outstanding segments.  No fancy routes.  Just a routine mid-week lunchbreak run.  Still, it was wonderful.  Perfect.

To have the freedom to run on my lunch break, to flex time when I felt so good that I wanted to take another loop.

133,1623508247.0,A huge THANK YOU to all of you runners who donate your shoes to thrift stores after you are done with them. (explanation in comments),"This post is to say thank you to all of you who already donate your used running shoes to thrift stores, and encourage others to do the same.  


I live in Central America, and brand new, legitimate running shoes here are very expensive. Pretty much double the price what you would pay in the US, even though income here is much less.  Another big problem is how many counterfeits there are.  In the US, there are very strict laws that prevent the import of counterfeit items, whereas in other countries like mine, it is a huge issue.  In fact the majority of the stores here sell knock-off name brand counterfeits and it is hard to find real name brand shoes.  To own 'originals' is symbol of pride.  When you donate your shoes to a thrift store or charity, there are certain groups that ship them overseas and they get sold at thrift stores down here.  I was lucky enough to find a pair of not too worn out Brooks at a thrift store the other day for only $20! Normally they would be close to, if not more than $200 new.  They were a size too big, but now I have a great pair of running shoes, thanks to someone like you. 


So when you donate your used shoes, please know that you are making it possible for someone less fortunate to enjoy the same hobby that you love. Even if your shoes are worn out, you could even just be providing a pair of 'originals' to a poorer person that will still last longer than the knockoffs.    



For those of you that don't donate yet, I would just like to encourage you to do so, because no matter how worn out they are, they are still useful to someone! 


With that said, do you donate? Why or why not?  Are you someone who has benefited from donated shoes?


EDIT: Just remembered a point that will help demonstrate just how rough it can be.  So even after you donate the shoes and they are picked up by someone like me and used for a while, there is a further market after that.  In my personal experience, there is a homeless guy who goes around and will offer to get me wheelbarrows full of black dirt for my garden for $5. Whenever I am done with the shoes, he is more than happy to take them and use them until they physically can't be used anymore.  Besides that, there are less fortunate people who go around on garbage day and will pick through the garbage looking for things to sell, and will grab any shoes they can find. They will bring these shoes to a local flea market and sell them to others who are in need.  So just remember, no matter how used they are, your shoes can always be useful to someone.",running

Yesterday 3.10.2020 I ran the race in which you run first the half and then a full marathon in which you get 3 medals for it, the half, the marathon and the double medal to show that you did the ultra.

It´s crazy to self reflect back and think how I was like 2,5 years ago. I was obese and even depressed prior to that, but then after a dozen attempts and watching a video called ´the why 100 miles´ by billy yang which moved me to tears is the day I gave weight loss another attempt, and I succeeded, in 13 months I lost 1/3 of my weight and began running and training for my marathon, with 10 months of training I finished it.

To the race now however, I finished it in 6:11:34 which is a slight bummer since I wanted a sub 6, I just had a big problem with my heart rate which I all I can blame is on diet, eating those damn burgers the day before. 

But the unexpected before finishing happened. To be honest after 43k I was starting to feel tired, 50k in I was even more so, now to 55k I was starting to get seriously tired I was pretty much done. I was hitting 6.30 min per km, 61 and 62 I was hitting 7+ min per km. However once i saw that last km sign I just asked my self a simple question, what if I can run it fast and bolt it? Well to this point I was seriously muscled fatigue, I was tired in ways I couldn´t imagine, I was hurting even, so the most obvious answer would be no. But no as soon as I bolted it I was running fine, no fatigue no nothing I was over taking people left and right, people running among me and being passed by me where looking like zombies, but here I was bolting it like no other and people cheered for me like mad. 
I enter the stadium and finish there, I literally ran almost a sub 4 min km, while also hitting sub 4 km speeds at some points of the surge. Crazy how much the brain can tell you how you´re supposed to feel but just a second of energy can fuel you so much more.

138,1669150649.0,Cardiologist resuscitates two fellow runners during half marathon,"[Link to Article](https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a42039130/cardiologist-rescusciates-two-fellow-runners-at-monterey-bay-half-marathon/)

Two runners collapsed and needed mid-race medical attention at the Monterey Bay Half Marathon on November 13. Until help arrived, runner and local cardiologist Steven Lome, D.O., administered life-saving measures to both male runners.

Lome, a cardiologist with Montage Medical Group in Monterey, California, tweeted that around mile 3 a runner went down, suffering cardiac arrest.

“Started CPR…people called 911. Defibrillator arrived in about 6 minutes, and rhythm was ventricular fibrillation (fatal arrhythmia). One shock and normal heart rhythm restored,” Lome tweeted.

Race medical director John Ellison, M.D., also with Montage Medical Group, told the Monterey Herald that after the runner’s heart rate was restored to normal, he “miraculously woke up,” and by the time he was brought to the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula he was awake and talking.

Lome continued running, tweeting he’d never catch up with his teenage kids who were also running.

Ellison told the Herald that after the first incident he thought, “that was our once-in-a-decade event at the half marathon.”

Yet at the finish line another male runner collapsed. And who was there to administer CPR?

Steven Lome.

“I crossed the finish line and threw my arms in the air…and another runner goes down right in front of me. Completely out. No pulse. Started CPR. Within 1 to 2 minutes a race volunteer brought a [defibrillator]...One shock and I restart chest compressions. He opens his eyes and says, “Why am I down here?” then proceeds to stop his Strava on his watch and wants to get up,” Lome tweeted.

That runner was also taken to Community Hospital.

Ellison told the Herald that a local cardiologist who happened to be finishing the race at the same time, performed the life-saving measure. It’s unclear if Ellison knew Lome was the same good samaritan at the beginning of the race.

Ellison said both runners were middle-aged and experienced who felt “like they were prepared to run.”

Lome, who did not treat the runners in the hospital, tweeted: “Both had undiagnosed heart disease, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and made full recoveries. What are the odds that two people have a cardiac arrest in one race? What are the odds they both make a full recovery (normally only 5% survive out of hospital cardiac arrest?) What are the odds that the same cardiologist happens to be right behind them both???”

Lome told Runner’s World by e-mail that he walked much of the race between the first and second incident because he was on the phone with medical personnel at the hospital.

Lome gave the second runner he assisted his own race medal when he visited him in the hospital.

“He did not receive one at the finish line and he crossed the finish before his cardiac arrest, so he clearly deserved it,” Lome said.

Lome, who has a half marathon PR of 1:42:04, finished the race in 2:30:32. His kids? 1:48:31 and 1:48:58. But they didn’t save any lives.

139,1619117882.0,4 hour solo run this morning.,"Currently feeling pretty accomplished as I sit in an epsom salt bath. 
What: goal was to just run for four hours this morning in preparation for my 24 hour race in May. 
Total miles-34.2
Passed the marathon in 3:07:xx
Passed 50k in 3:42:xx
Overall pace 7:02 per mile

Where: Wissahickon park in philadelphia, I wanted a relatively flat place that I could park my car near and use as an aid station.

Went with the alpha fly’s. I was apprehensive due to the surface of forbidden drive, which is a mix of packed dirt and gravel, but they really held up and didn’t need to change socks or shoes.

Started around 8:20am, weather was clear about 40 degrees when I started and slight gusts of wind but nothing too bad.

Nutrition- I use the Maurten gels on the hours as they passed with the 2nd hour being a caffeinated one. Additionally salt cap pills once an hour. 

Course-basically went back and forth on a section of the road/ trail never going more than 2.5 miles total from the car, when the hours came up I would hover around my car, pop the trunk and have a gel while doing small circles so I could throw them away afterwards. 

Nothing ground breaking, but my first time doing that type of distance completely solo with no support. Really happy with the pace and the performance of the shoes.",running
140,1619430546.0,Low heart rate training has been the most humbling running experience thus far,"I have been running for \~10 years, forever in what I now know is the ""grey zone"". I thought of myself as a pretty good runner- dripping sweat, panting, pushing myself to my limit every single time. 2:00pm would roll around and I would be lethargic, low energy, needing more coffee to keep me going. I'm lucky I didn't get worse injuries - just some knee pain here and there. All of this is part of running!"" I would tell myself.  Finally breaking the 25 minute 5k I've wanted for so long and no races to look forward to, I thought, ""what's next?""  

I've been practicing low heart rate training for about 4 weeks now, and wow. It's like being a new runner again. Runners who I previously would have passed are now passing me. I'm stopping to take walking breaks to get my heart rate back down. Maybe I am not as good of a runner as I previously thought! Some days are disheartening when I look at my watch and see how long it has taken me to do 10k when I compare to my previous times. But I was over-worked and over-training week after week.  For the past four weeks,  I have felt energized, ready for the day, no pain whatsoever. And the best part, I am enjoying running again. No one else on the road knows (or cares) what you're doing. This is for me to continue running for the long-term and it has been the most humbling experience I've had since being a new runner.  


I just wanted to share my experience and see if anyone else has felt the same way!",running
141,1594535993.0,I ran my first 5k without stopping and it felt amazing!!,"For the past two years I  have been dealing with anxiety and depression mostly due to grad school and more recently, exacerbated by family conflicts that I am being put in the middle of.  Due to my subbornness I didn't want to admit or accept that something was wrong so I continued along experiencing what felt like the highest of highs with sudden transitions to the lowest of lows.  During this time I was completely overwhelmed by work and definitely let myself go, resulting in a 30 pound weight gain which only made me feel worse about myself.  After 6 months of on and off stints in the gym, Covid rolled around and shut everything down, which forced me to find some other way to get active without access to any weights.  After what felt like the worst 2 months of my life, with the support of my extremely supportive fiance I finally admitted I needed help and sought out a counsellor.  One of the main things she recommended was trying to incorporate exercise into my life on a regular basis, even if it was just a 30 minute walk.  Around the same time I stumbled across Ben Parkes' youtube channel (a runner from the UK) I somehow ended up down a rabbit hole of running videos.  After about 5 hours of watching all sorts of videos amazingly positive people making running look fun, for some reason I felt inspired by them to finally make a change in my life.  I decided to set a goal of working towards running 3 km without stopping.  When I started out I could barely make it 1 km without walking, but I just decided to keep going even if I had to walk parts of the run.  Reaching that goal gave me something to be proud of that no one could take from me, and made me want to repeat that feeling.  Fast forward one month, and I've been running 4-5 a week and I've increased my distance to 5 km.  Today I was finally able to go the entire 5 km without stopping!!  I know it's not much, but I honestly thought it would take me months to be able to comfortably run a 5k, so I'm still blown away by reaching this goal.

Somehow the activity I hated the most has maybe saved my life.  Running has given me a reason to get out of bed every day and motivates me to do things that make me feel good about myself.  Some runs are harder than others and there are days where I feel so incredibly awkward during my run, but I never regreat a single one, and I always feel better once they're done.  I know I'm not out of the woods yet, and there are still good days and bad days, but for the first time in what has felt like a lifetime, I feel like I can deal with the negative emotions when they show up.  I've lurked this subreddit for a while and I'm constantly inspired by the amount of encouragement and positivity in the community.  So I just wanted to say thank you to all the great people in this subreddit, whether you know it or not, you are helping many people change their lives.

**TLDR**: I have been dealing with depression and anxiety related to grad school and family issues and started running during quarantine because I was sick of being so sedentary and unhealthy.  Today I ran my first 5k from start to finish with no stopping and I feel amazing!

**EDIT:** Wow!! I did not expect this post to be so well received! Thank you everyone for all your support and words of encouragement! I'm looking forward to seeing where running takes me. :)

142,1590885848.0,"Ran my longest run today of 9.24 miles, while pushing my son in a stroller!","Some info about me - M/30/6’0”/~190lbs. 

I have been running for about a year now and before last year, never really saw myself as the running type. Ive always struggled to run so i would stick to biking mainly. Early lasy year my brother convinced me to do the Rocky Run (i did the 5k portion) so i had to start running. 

Up until this point the longest run i ever did was 8 miles and i was not pushing a stroller. The longest run besides that was around 5.5 (my typical running route). 

I didnt intend to go so long today but man i was just feeling great. I managed to get a personal record of 9.24 miles! The fact that i was able to do that while pushing my almost-3 year old was the icing on the cake. I’m just really excited and wanted to tell people! 

Usually my pace is around 9:15/mile but the hot (and very humid - pennsylvania) weather lately has put me in the low 10s. Today my overall pace was 10:28. Again, super thrilled considering i was pushing my son the whole time. 

I gotta say, it was great. The last 2 miles i dropped to 10:45 because i felt like i hit a bit of a wall but i pushed through and ran the whole thing. 

One question though, anyone else here run with strollers? I didnt notice until now, about 8 hours after my run, but my shoulders are SHOT! I noticed the one was a little tight because of having my arms fixed the whole time but its very sore now. Is this something you get used to? Or do people typically only hold with 1 hand on the stroller at a time and switch back/forth? 

Just wanted to share that, and thanks for the great community here! This is one of my favorite subs on reddit, everyone is always so nice and helpful. 

Happy running!",running

My husband plays Dungeons and Dragons late on Thursday nights so I try to let him sleep in as much as possible on Friday but I strongly considered calling him to come get me.  I decided to tough it out (was actually kinda nice at first) but sure enough, I heard a thunder-clap, followed pretty quick by lightning.  Again I thought about calling but decided against it.

About a minute later, around the bend in the road, all ""Knight-in-a-Blue-Toyota-Tacoma"" style, comes hubby.  (He didn't know my route, just guessed and found me.)  He checked in with me to make sure I was ok, we assessed that we thought I could make it back on foot before it got real nasty, and then he helpfully leap-frogged my route back, driving ahead but staying with me to make sure.

Crazy to think 2-3 years ago i used to frequent this sub reddit in hopes to get back into running, but felt so hopeless as i was so heavy and it just felt incredibly painful to run.

Last week i achieved 100 km of running in a single week and i shed a tear for how fortunate i am to run without worry, no injury, and no pain whatsoever. I teared up, because it wasn't always like this, it used to hurt bad, really badly to the point where i would chafe up a couple of km in a walk as i used to be obese, it hurt, and it bled.

Never in a million years would i have imagined to be capable of running a sub 20 5k this year, nor run a 100 km in a single week. Hell even early this year i was still losing weight, so i wasn't even focused on running completely. I had simple goals for 2019, but i far exceeded them, and i'm incredibly happy to be capable of running.

Here is the sub 20 5k run that i had, Strava: https://www.strava.com/activities/2924276441 I reckon that it could have been a much faster 19 minute 5k run, as i had a few hiccups for the prep and during the run on the final 1 km the laces on my right shoe came off, but i gave it hell.

148,1606863545.0,I ran a mile every single day of November!,"MILE 1–9:17
MILE 30–7:57

I’ve run off and on for a few years now. (Definitely more off than on, but...) I’ve done a handful of 5Ks and that’s about the farthest I’ve gone. I enjoy running and always feel amazing when I’m doing it, but staying consistent for more than a few months has always been a struggle for me. On a whim I decided to run a mile every day in November. 

To be honest, I really thought I’d burn out halfway through and not finish. But I did it. I ran a mile a day for a whole month. 30 whole miles. I know a mile isn’t much, I know 30 miles isn’t even that much, but it was less about distance for me and more about sticking with it. It didn’t matter if I worked late, if it was sunny, if it was dark, if I felt great, if I was exhausted. I just did it. And those few minutes I was running each day became the best part of the day. Before I knew it, I was looking forward to running and planning routes in my head while I was still at work. It became a great stress reliever and an overall mood booster. Running no longer feels like a chore. It feels like a drug and I can’t get enough of it! 

So, do you have any suggestions on where I should go from here? I think some good goals may be to work up to a higher weekly milage and get to a point where I can run a 5K a few times a week. I feel like I’ve laid some good bricks in my running foundation and I’m hoping to build on it and keep running—long-term this time. The power of running is truly amazing!",running
149,1565385811.0,D1 college runner with some advice,"Relatively new to reddit, I had no idea the communities are so in depth, let alone a community for something I revolve my life around. Here's some stuff for people to make their runs easier or better for themselves, especially for beginners

\-go to the bathroom religiously before every single run. Every. Single. Run.

\-Think your're hydrated enough? You're wrong. Down that extra poland spring an hour before the run and then refer back to the previous tip. You'll be amazed how much hydration has a factor on your runs.

\-always eat breakfast. And when I say breakfast, I mean a light breakfast. Running on an empty stomach means running with no fuel

\-gatorade is ok to some extent. You did a solid 2 miles? 50g of sugar isn't worth it then, grab a water. 15 miles? Your glycogen and blood sugar is very low by this point, go ahead and chug it 

\-on a treadmill? tired of looking at the time and distance every 20 seconds which makes the run feel like an eternity? grab a towel and put it over all the gauges so you cant look at them at all. Just zone out and go for it  

\-the cold is your friend. Winter is your best friend if you are a distance runner. Those summer runs where you nearly pass out thinking you are putting in awesome work is false. Aim your summer runs for early morning or after sunset, basic common sense

\-long laces on shoes? tuck the rabbit ears of the knot into the laces of the tongue in the shoe. Seems like common sense but I myself had to be told about it

\-if you have the money, buy two pairs of running shoes and alternate the pair every other day. Using one pair every day wears them out much faster

\-don't be ashamed of those short shorts. Your body will breathe better and your range of motion is a higher priority than what that old person giving you the evil eye across the street thinks

\-do not finish every single run at a faster pace or an all out sprint. The average ""run"" or training day not on a track should be finished feeling like you could have done another mile or two. This is how you make sure you do not ""burn out"" during the season and it trains your body to have a reserve when it matters during a race

\-diet and weights are incredibly helpful. I would even go as far as to say it is half the battle to achieving great times and low body fat. Just because you burned 800 calories on that long run doesn't give you the right to an ""award"" for eating like shit.  

\-Running with others or in a group is the by far the greatest motivation. I don't know where I'd be without my teammates. This eliminates the self motivation factor and the temptation to ""skip a day"". Find some friends or other runners and you'll be amazed the routine and ethic it makes

\-quality over consistency is bullshit. just because you had a bad training day does not mean it was worthless. You did it. You got through it. You'll gain something from it. It's far better than not doing anything and waiting until you ""felt better""

Good luck my dudes

EDIT: thank you for the gold and platinum! Never thought this would help so many people

Also to clarify: the 2 pairs of shoes are in order for the foam to have time to rebound, and therefore have longer quality. And breakfast applies for people who run very far and burn significant amount of calories per day. It all comes down to preference though",running
150,1585499239.0,13.1 miles at 18 weeks pregnant. Hormone fueled tears were shed.,"Up until the moment I started this run this morning, I doubted my ability to do it. But here we are! For reference, I have been running regularly for about a year and a half. My PR for a half marathon is currently 2:04. When my husband and I decided to try for our second baby last Fall I knew I wanted to go into pregnancy maintaining as much of my running progress as I could. As soon as I found out I was pregnant in December I registered for a half marathon that was supposed to be today. I cleared it with my Dr. at my first appointment, and trained while completely disregarding the clock. This has been a wonderful relief, not checking my pace or feeling disappointed in being slower. I was even ready to transfer my race bib to somebody else if unforeseen events kept me from running. And then the coronavirus made its way here. When the race was canceled I told myself I could still run it on my own, but then spent the next few weeks building doubt in my mind.

Then I hit the pavement with hours of one of my favorite podcasts downloaded, and let the rest melt away. The weather was less than ideal, mid-40's, strong wind, and a constant drizzle. The way out had the wind at my back, so my celebration at the turn around point was short lived when I turned into the wind and drizzle straight in my face. Then between mile 8-9 my right knee started to protest pretty adamantly. I walked for a couple minutes, then continued to limp along, the pain a little less. At 11.5 miles I was passing our local library and decided to switch to some pump it up music for the last 1.6, and danced with my reflection in the library windows. This is when the hormone tears threatened to start. I couldn't believe I had made it that far!

My husband and 3 year old daughter came outside and cheered me on for the final .1 stretch, and while it's sad to be without the big crowd and the announcer saying your name as you finish, they are my absolute favorite cheerleaders, and more hormone tears were shed.

Finished in 2:24, and am pleasantly surprised by that, as I thought I would go over 3 hours for sure, toting this cucumber sized fetus along.

Thanks for reading my blubbering, and I hope everybody here is staying healthy and safe and not going too stir crazy! We can get through this together for sure, and I love reading everybody's running updates every day. Keep it up my fellow runners! Someday, I'll see you out there again.

Five months on from his stroke my husband's strength and resilience has astounded me.

He was discharged from the hospital after just a week and has improved near every day. The biggest obstacle has probably been fatigue which we've studiously treated with regular napping :-)

Last week he started running again using C25K to keep the build-up slow and controlled and he's really enjoying being active again (with ID this time!). We're looking forward to hopefully participating in some (gentle) events later this year, pandemic willing.

We've been extremely fortunate; everyone's journey is different but this one at least has a happy ending. Thanks everyone for the kind wishes and support, and, please, take ID with you.

ETA: thank you everyone for the awards and the well wishes, they are genuinely heart warming. But best of all is hearing how many people his story and the other stories shared here have inspired to carry emergency contact info.
Just yesterday we mapped out his plan to his first 50-mile race for 2022, the game is afoot!

\### Pre-training

Back in 2015, I moved cities for work and realised I was fat and miserable.  These are understatements.  I had a BMI of 45, and was struggling so much with my mental health that simply leaving my flat was incredibly hard to do.  I decided that fixing being fat would be easier than fixing being sad, so did some googling about how to lose weight and discovered it was free to calorie count so cracked on with that.

&#x200B;

It was not easy, although it is simple.  Losing weight is about denial - in the same way I'll tell my toddler cousins not to touch the stove, I have to tell myself that the food I want is not actually good for me.  But slowly the weight chipped off.  During this I plucked up the courage to go to my GP and ask for help, and then tell my family I was struggling, and then some friends.  It was harder than any other thing I will ever do.  I was put on quite a lot of medication, and into therapy and group sessions, and as my weight dropped my coping mechanisms improved. 

&#x200B;

I started running in January 2016, at a BMI of 40.  I'd lost 50lb by then!  I started couch to 5k, and then ran my first 5k in April that year in just under an hour - I was over the moon and immediately cracked on with building up to a 10k. I didn't are about speed, running was making me fall in love with my body in a way I had never been before.  Because weightloss isn't pretty - I have lots of loose skin, and lots of insecurities over it.  But running showed me my body was amazing - I can ask it to do mad things and it tries! I put it through so much and all I get is yet more effort.  

&#x200B;

Anyway.  That's the backstory.  I now have a BMI of 23 or so, and I'm actually off all mental health related medications.   So goals have been achieved - I am no longer always fat and miserable!

&#x200B;

\### Training

I am in a running club, and my level leader put together a plan for me.  It almost immediately began falling apart as I went through about 4 health issues in quick succession.  But by mid-January I had all sorts of prescriptions to my name and I was regaining some functionality.  I managed to do long runs of 14 miles, 16 miles, 18 miles and 20 miles, a half marathon and a 20 mile race in the run up, and although I didn't think I'd be fast I felt secure in my 5 hour goal being achievable.  Based on my half marathon time, I also set a second goal of 4 hour 41 minutes.  But all I really wanted to do was finish an not cry til I was away from any photographers!

&#x200B;

\### Pre-race

Nervous wreck. That is all.  I hate pasta too and have spent 4 years on a deficit, so trying to eat at maintenance during the taper really messed my head.   But potatoes and bagels are life, and I got through it.  

&#x200B;

I decided to start with the 4:45 pacer and see how I felt at mile 20 and try and kick on for my stretch goal.   For me, the starting crowd was a lot, so having someone to focus on and follow made it less overwhelming.  I also met some lovely ladies who heard it was my first and immediately took me under their wing and told me how amazing I'd be.  Loved them and they made a hard situation a lot easier.

&#x200B;

\### Miles \[1\] to \[5\]

The pacer was amazing and I loved him.  He was essentially running a party and everyone was invited.  The first 5 miles just flew by and I felt so good and happy.  Stopped through a water station and then carried on and just everything felt so good.

&#x200B;

\### Miles \[6\] to \[10\]

I found myself pulling away from the pace group.  I kept slowing down again but my legs wanted me to roll on and so I did!  I got a bit of a cramp in my hip at mile 7 but told it no and kept trucking on.  The pain went away so I refused to dwell on it, but focused a bit more on running well.

&#x200B;

I didn't really chat on this race.  Normally I like a good natter but I was so busy taking in the crowds and the support and the fact I was running a marathon I just didn't.  Mile 10 was a bit of a struggle but only mentally for some reason.  I think I managed to convince myself that 10 miles was halfway there and then had to accept it wasn't.  

&#x200B;

\### Miles \[10\] to \[18\]

Between mile 11 and 13, you did a loop round and then came back on yourself.  You also ran up over the overpass.  I've run plenty of hilly races, and this overpass felt like bloody Everest.  The crowd support was unreal through these towns though and it was awesome seeing so many people coming back - it made me realise soon enough that would be me and, soon enough, it was!  I also saw two guys in giant Bert and Ernie costumes and thought, mad I have to catch them up.  

&#x200B;

Somewhere between these miles I also saw an enormous tortoise going up and down the pavement alongside us runners.  It felt like he was taunting me, but also he was super cool and it made me happy to see!  I was having an absolute blast at this point, the miles were ticking by and I felt carried along by the support and the other runners.  I caught up to the 4:30 pacer, and also overtook Bert & Ernie, a man dressed in a HUGE rhino outfit and Batman.  

&#x200B;

\### Mile \[19\]

Alpacas!  In a field next to us!  I love alpacas and got super excited but no one else did so I just bounced along in silent glee.

&#x200B;

\### Miles \[20\] to \[23\]

At mile 20 I stopped for a loo break, because while the queue would make me lose at least 5 minutes, I'd rather be slower and retain some dignity.  I'm no Paula Radcliffe.  At this point I became aware that my quads were incredibly sore, but it was only 10k to go so I cracked on.  

&#x200B;

The next two miles lumbered by, and I became increasingly aware that I also had blisters forming on my toes and my thighs were chafing.  The loose skin on them sometimes just seems to catch all wrong some runs, and this was one of those runs.  At mile 22 there were some St Johns paramedics handing out globs of vaseline and I gratefully took one and tried to relieve some of the soreness.  Then wiped my eyes and spent the next 600m trying to stop looking like the twat who'd just smeared vaseline all over their face and couldn't see.  Some lady thought I was crying and started shouting loads of encouragement, which made me tear up for real. 

&#x200B;

\### Miles \[23\] to \[26\]

Yeah these ones hurt.  My quads seized up and I started to walk. 10m later I realised walking also hurt so I might as well run, and all it was was one park run.  I'd run park run when I had a BMI of 37, and I'd be damned if one defeated me now.  So I ran a bit harder, looking a little like John Wayne after a particularly hard day in the saddle.  

&#x200B;

At about mile 25 you turn down the home straight and you can see the finish line.  And a mile later it feels like you've been running for 3 years and the finish line is further away than before.  I also need glasses but refuse to run in them as they annoy me, and I can't wear contacts so I just go for the blind approach.  This screws with my depth perception, which also didn't help. 

&#x200B;

\### Mile \[26.2\] 

One of my closest friends, who has known me since well before this whole journey began and who has been one of the pillars in my recovery, was at mile 26 with his partner.  They started screaming my name and cheering and I managed to force my stubby little legs into a sprint (scuttle, but we're being generous here).  And then I was through the finish, in 4 hours and 30 minutes.  

&#x200B;

\### The Aftermath, and What's Next

I very calmly walked round, collected my medal and my t-shirt, and then met my friends by the exit.  They said well done and I just started sobbing.  I struggle with being proud of myself and I almost never am, but right now I am.  I made my body do things that 4 years ago I could never have contemplated, and I loved it.  I am frequently very mean to myself about how I look - I have loose skin all over, and I still feel very chubby - but this has given me new power to keep the mean little voices at bay. 

&#x200B;

I drove home that evening (3 hours!), and spent today walking round London with two friends.  My legs hate me, my quads have fully disassociated from my body, and I have weird chafe marks all over (sorry underboob, sorry lower back).  But I am ebullient and all the sore bits are worth it!

&#x200B;

Next, I have a summer of shorter races, up to half marathon and a 15 mile trail run.  And a 24 hour team race with my running club.  But I'm drawn to trying another marathon too - I'm going to keep long run Sunday going, and try and reach my goal of 1000 miles in 2019.  And just keep loving running!

155,1594224311.0,Call people out on their shitty behavior?,"Yesterday on my run I called a biker out for honking at a female runner. My exact words were ""You can't honk at women."" His response was really dramatic - got off his bike in the middle of the road and started shouting ""I'm marine corps, bitch! You want some?"" and a lot of obscenities and challenging me to fight him. If it's relevant, I'm in Southern California.

I'm 36 and never been in a fight, so i didn't really want to start that day - especially not in the road with a dude wearing a helmet. Also he wasn't wearing a mask. I left, since it didn't seem like he wanted to hear me out. He called me some names then drove off.

But anyway, my question is - is this how people are generally going to respond when called out? It does seem like socially, at least here in the United States, that tensions are high and that toxic masculinity is more prevalent than ever. Is this something that we, as males, should even be doing? I'm not some shining knight looking to be a hero, I just wanted to let him know his behavior was unacceptable. Thanks for your thoughts.",running
156,1597939898.0,"35 years old, finally got under 8 minute mile time","I've been sober for 63 days and have used running as a way to get my head straight. In the process I've found something that I really love!  I run 3 to 5 times a week.  At first I just made sure I did it, but then I started actually trying to get better. I have been doing some Maff training, sprints, and going for longer runs. 

 I started doing a mile run ""test"" every 2 weeks or so.  First time was 8:42, second was 8:36, third was 8:08, and today was 7:32.  I am happy that I made improvement, especially this last 2 run times, but I can't help but feel frustrated! Is this a good timeline for progress? I am trying to get better and eat a very healthy diet. Should I be doing more or should I hang in there as these are healthy results/rate of improvement? 

Lastly, this sub rocks, I love checking in here everyday, there is alot to inspire new runners.  Thanks for all the quality posts and everyone stay safe out there!

Edit: Was resting and came back to this! Thank you everyone for the encouragement, it means alot!  Thanks for the gold!  To my fellow sober runners, I am very glad to be one of you, DM me if you ever need support, it happens. Everyone have a great weekend and good luck!",running
157,1609264125.0,Today I ran a 1:44:15 half marathon (8 minute PR!),"This isn't a real race (hopefully I can race a half soon!), but just a report on how my morning half marathon went. 

(feel free to skip these next 2 paragraphs): 

In March of this year, I ran a 10k PR of 46:34, and a couple weeks later, I decided to run a half for the first time on my own. I started out pretty conservatively, and sped up throughout. I finished in 1:52 and was satisfied with how it went. I didn't really have any time goals, and was excited that I ran at an 8:36 pace per mile. In August, I wanted to get under 1:50, but I ran a 1:59. It was hot and even started thundering, and I drastically slowed down (almost walking) at mile 12. I knew the heat played a big role, and it was still a good time, but I was discouraged not to PR.

This fall, I had a good cross country season, even with the fewer meets due to COVID. I kept up my training during November/December, and felt motivated to run more. Recently, I started thinking about trying to time trial a half marathon again. In November, I ran a 10k time trial and got literally the same exact time (46:34), but I still was hopeful I could PR in the half. I set an ambitious goal of subbing 1:45 because then I would be averaging under 8 min/mile!

RACE REPORT: I worked out a race plan after googling and posting here on this sub reddit. Today, I pretty much followed the plan, and it actually went better than I thought. Mile 1 I ran in 8:28, and I took the next 4 or so miles pretty easy (miles 2 & 3 were had long gradual uphills). I felt good coming through the 10k in just under 51 minutes. (Original plan was to do roughly a  51 min 1st 10k, 49 min 2nd 10k, last 0.7 sprint). Mile 7 I felt really good! I had picked it up a bit, found a rhythm, and felt like picking it up more. Miles 7-9 were just under 8 minutes, and had some hills. Mile 9.5 was where I really felt the fatigue. I was panicking a bit because it didn't look like I would achieve my goal unless I picked it up. I got to mile 10 and continued to push. Once I hit mile 12, I was in a lot of discomfort, desperately wanted to stop and just call it a tempo long run, but I tried to make it to 12.6, then 12.8, then the final sprint. The last couple of miles finally had some nice downhills, which I took advantage of. Then, it was done and the best feeling ever! 

Was excited to share this! Will take any advice for how to improve (maybe sub 1:42 half, sub 46 10k) and questions. I know people suggested running more even splits, which I will definitely keep in mind for next time after I've been really training for this. Just wanted to start slower in case I couldn't hold it. Hopefully I won't be too sore tomorrow!",running
158,1573133656.0,"[NY Times] Mary Cain: I Was the Fastest Girl in America, Until I Joined Nike","Here is the [link to the article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/opinion/nike-running-mary-cain.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage), which contains a 7 minute video. Part of the article is below: 

""At 17, Mary Cain was already a record-breaking phenom: the fastest girl in a generation, and the youngest American track and field athlete to make a World Championships team. In 2013, she was signed by the best track team in the world, Nike’s Oregon Project, run by its star coach Alberto Salazar.

Then everything collapsed. Her fall was just as spectacular as her rise, and she shares that story for the first time in the Video Op-Ed above.

Instead of becoming a symbol of girls’ unlimited potential in sports, Cain became yet another standout young athlete who got beaten down by a win-at-all-costs culture. Girls like Cain become damaged goods and fade away. We rarely hear what happened to them. We move on.
Sign Up for Debatable

Agree to disagree, or disagree better? We'll help you understand the sharpest arguments on the most pressing issues of the week, from new and familiar voices.

The problem is so common it affected the only other female athlete featured in the last Nike video ad Cain appeared in, the figure skater Gracie Gold. When the ad came out in 2014, like Cain, Gold was a prodigy considered talented enough to win a gold medal at the next Olympics. And, like Cain, Gold got caught in a system where she was compelled to become thinner and thinner. Gold developed disordered eating to the point of imagining taking her life.

Nike has come under fire in recent months for doping charges involving Salazar. He is now banned from the sport for four years, and his elite Nike team has been dismantled. In October, Nike’s chief executive resigned. (In an email, Salazar denied many of Cain’s claims, and said he had supported her health and welfare. Nike did not respond to a request for comment.)

The culture that created Salazar remains.

Kara Goucher, an Olympic distance runner who trained with the same program under Salazar until 2011, said she experienced a similar environment, with teammates weighed in front of one another.

“When you’re training in a program like this, you’re constantly reminded how lucky you are to be there, how anyone would want to be there, and it’s this weird feeling of, ‘Well, then, I can’t leave it. Who am I without it?’” Goucher said. “When someone proposes something you don’t want to do, whether it’s weight loss or drugs, you wonder, ‘Is this what it takes? Maybe it is, and I don’t want to have regrets.’ Your careers are so short. You are desperate. You want to capitalize on your career, but you’re not sure at what cost.”

She said that after being cooked meager meals by an assistant coach, she often had to eat more in the privacy of her condo room, nervous he would hear her open the wrappers of the energy bars she had there.

A big part of this problem is that women and girls are being forced to meet athletic standards that are based on how men and boys develop. If you try to make a girl fit a boy’s development timeline, her body is at risk of breaking down. That is what happened to Cain.

After months of dieting and frustration, Cain found herself choosing between training with the best team in the world, or potentially developing osteoporosis or even infertility. She lost her period for three years and broke five bones. She went from being a once-in-a-generation Olympic hopeful to having suicidal thoughts.

“America loves a good child prodigy story, and business is ready and waiting to exploit that story, especially when it comes to girls,” said Lauren Fleshman, who ran for Nike until 2012. “When you have these kinds of good girls, girls who are good at following directions to the point of excelling, you’ll find a system that’s happy to take them. And it’s rife with abuse.”

We don’t typically hear from the casualties of these systems — the girls who tried to make their way in this system until their bodies broke down and they left the sport. It’s easier to focus on bright new stars, while forgetting about those who faded away. We fetishize the rising athletes, but we don’t protect them. And if they fail to pull off what we expect them to, we abandon them.

Mary Cain is 23, and her story certainly isn’t over. By speaking out, she’s making sure of that.""

162,1629725583.0,Random runner passing by me lightly patted me on the butt to encourage me to keep running because I had stopped. And I’m just incredibly upset.,"I was shocked at first, then he smiled at me and gave me a thumbs up to keep running so I felt guilty for being angry because he was being nice, but the more I kept thinking about it, the more upset and angry I was that some random person just thought they could run up and touch me. I couldn’t hear him coming up behind me because of my music.

I stopped multiple times after that and just stood there, feeling like I wanted to throw up or cry. I know people have had a lot worse happen to them but I just, need people to tell me that this isn’t okay and if they’ve dealt with something similar before.

I don’t even feel okay running now because I have to keep looking over my shoulder. I have anxiety and this is exactly the sort of random scenario I used to torture myself about, afraid some random person would come up and touch me inappropriately but I told myself I was being ridiculous and pushed it away only for it to happen…

I’m just really upset.

EDIT: I just wanted to make a statement to address everything I've read in the comments. I've tried to go through and respond to everyone to thank them for taking the time to chime in.
1. It takes a lot of energy to be empathetic and be able to sympathize with a stranger (especially with how crazy the world is today) so I am grateful for all of you who took the time to offer advice and or encouragement.
2. For those of you who felt I was overreacting, I absolutely understand where you are coming from, too. Yes, I know that much shittier things happen to people on a daily basis, that was part of the struggle I had in validating my own feelings. I personally would never tell someone how to process their trauma and have often found myself dejected and confused by being swept into someone else's misery olympics and unable to heal because I didn't validate my own feelings, but rest assured, I am 100% capable of finding the lesson and opportunity for growth in negative experiences.
3. I am very empathetic and try to see the best in people. I am slow to anger and fighting or getting pissed is usually the last thing I do. Today, I felt like this was a sign to be more proactive in looking out for myself. I am seeing this as a warning to be more cautious of my surroundings when I am out and alone, and to see this as a stimulus to help raise awareness and also to learn more about victims of sexual assault.
4. To those of you saying this isn't a big deal: maybe it isn't to you, and that's totally fine. To each their own, you know? But I'm not going to pretend something doesn't bother me if it does, and if I can learn more and help others at the same time, I'm going to do it.",running
163,1608011825.0,I'm am extremely out of shape and I want run 30 miles.,"My brother and I used to jog together. He was a phenomenal naturally gifted runner, but he would always come back for me. 

His golden birthday would have been September 30. He always said he wanted to do 30 miles on his 30th and we'd do it together. He committed suicide in 2017,  and I haven't run since. I finally read his note he left me (a few days ago), and in it he asked me to play the playlist he left me for my run and he'd be there with me step by step. 

I'm 5'2 and 200 pounds. Is it realistic for me to build up to the 30 miles by his birthday. It's the last thing he left for me to do, and I find it incredibly important.

164,1596299551.0,Today I finally called out my husband.. an avid runner and bit of running form snob 🙄,"So here’s the deal.. I used to run “for fun” when I met my husband. I stopped a couple of years ago while he continued to run at least once a week.

Last month I decided that I want to start running again and started training pretty seriously which includes a program that would let me work up to my goal.

The first week, my endurance sucked and I really struggled to do a full km.. and my husband insisted on joining me so that he can “help me”.

But guess what, he was no help. Since I was so slow he would make comments about how our puppy was faster than me and constantly pick on my form.

So I started avoiding him and he noticed it the following week (my plan includes 3 technical runs and 3 recovery run/walks a week). When he asked me about it, I calmly explained to him that his comments on our runs were condescending and mean. And instead of feeling motivated to run faster or better, I was inclined to throw a heavy object in his direction. He got the message and the following week things went better (he hasn’t made a single comment in the last 2 weeks!).

But yesterday something happened again. We have lots of runners in our neighborhood at different levels and every time he sees someone running with less than “ideal form” or as he likes to call it “a phoebe runner”, he would laugh.

Here’s my thing guys - I am always amazed by anyone that does any kind of physical activity and to me I don’t care how you look when you run, swim, cycle or whatever else, you are awesome for getting out there and doing your thing. I am proud of you and you make my soul happy.

So I snapped a little bit and told him to stop being an a** because not everyone runs with perfect form like pro runners. Hell even the pro runners have their moments! 

So my message to you is that if you are starting your running journey or just do your own thing when you run, don’t listen to naysayers.

In my husband’s case, me speaking up is enough for him to reflect on it and think about it. After all, he’s an amazing man albeit sometimes a little self unaware. But speak up if it bothers you. He didn’t know how I felt about it and always thought it was funny but now he understands that it isn’t. And that’s ok.

167,1619862084.0,Ran a 5K for the first time in my life!,"I’ve been a lurker for a few years now, but I finally have something to contribute. 

tldr: ran a 5k for the first time in my life after years of struggling with consistency and generally feeling like a loser.

Background:

I started running casually in middle school with my dad, and have always enjoyed the hit of endorphins it gives you. We would do 1-2 miles and alternate running/ walking. My dad had been running most of his life, and could do a full 6 miles at one point. A few years later in 8th grade I did football for a year and got in really good shape. We were running more and eventually, I got up to 2 miles without having to walk. Sadly around this time, my dad tore his Achilles’ tendon. Needless to say, he was in a cast/ boot for about 6 months.

Without my running partner, I had no motivation to run on my own while he recovered. Once you tear a tendon, it’s much easier to tear it again, so my dad was hesitant to get back into our routine. Something else to know about my dad is that when he was 17, his father died of a heart attack at 46 while out running. He had gotten out of shape towards the end and became a bit of a weekend warrior. On a particularly hot summer day, he went out jogging. That day he was found dead, face down on the sidewalk. This weighed heavily on my father as he was near the same age, and was concerned about being genetically predisposed to heart problems.

Eventually, we started back up again, but with my poor self discipline and everything previously mentioned, it wasn’t very much. We might’ve jogged 1 or 2 times per week for 1 or 2 miles, walking much more than we were running. On top of this, I stopped watching what I ate, gained about 40lbs, and developed depression and social anxiety. I always wanted to get back to my former level of conditioning, but the will to commit just wasn’t there. That had been the status quo for the past 6 or so years.

Past few months:

This February I was at an all time low, and I realized I had ignored my anxiety/ depression for too long. I went home from college and talked to my parents about getting help. They were very supportive and helped me get on medication and find a counselor. My dad told me how much exercise and running had helped him with depression in the past, so he, my little brother, and myself started running a lot more consistently. I quickly noticed the benefits and soon felt much better.

About a month and a half ago, my dad told me about this local running group doing a C25K program in preparation of a 5k race in June. I thought it sounded like a good idea, so he signed us all up. They meet twice a week, starting out at a mile. You can run the whole thing, or follow the coaches walk/ run intervals that they increase each week. I started out in the walk/ run group.

On the weekends, we’re supposed to run on our own, so we’ve been running in our neighborhood. For about  a month we would run whatever intervals we had been doing that week, but we would do it for a full 5k rather than the shorter distance the group does. 2 weeks ago, my dad wanted to challenge us to see if we could run a mile without stopping. I honestly didn’t think i could as I hadn’t done that since 9th grade, but we took a slower pace (10min34sec) and we were able to do it. We felt so good that we took a 3 min walk and ran the 1 mile back. The next week we decided to do the same thing, but this time, we would see how far we could go. We ran the full 2 miles without stopping. It felt so good having matched what I used to do in 9th grade. I was finally making some progress after years of getting nowhere. We started running with the running group instead of the interval group, which felt great.

Then tonight we again decided to just see how far we could go. My neighborhood makes a loop and going all the way around back to our mailbox is 1.4 miles. We also clocked it to know where to stop if we ever do a full 5k in the neighborhood. Anyway, we make 1 lap and we’re feeling good. Second lap was a bit harder. There are some nasty hills in our neighborhood, but we kept the pace slow and consistent. At the end of the second, our heart rates were still within our target zones  and we all agreed that we felt good enough to keep going. We went the whole way! I can’t even describe how accomplished I felt when we passed the marker for 3.1 miles. To have surpassed where I was several years ago was such a huge goal for me, and my confidence in myself is through the roof. I’m so proud of my dad who hadn’t run that long since before he was injured and says he’s moved past the fear of suffering a heart attack like his father (he’s still gonna monitor his heart rate on future runs). My bother, too, who just started running this year. 

The amount of progress you can make when you have a goal set that you’re training toward is incredible. Following a program with other runners is so rewarding and fun and really helps with understanding how to run effectively. We’re well ahead of the group at this point with just 1 month out from our race. At a 10:39 pace, I think we’ll be working on getting our time down. I’m at a point that I wasn’t sure I would ever reach, and I couldn’t be happier!

Race Information

* **Date:** November 2, 2019
* **Distance:** 10 km
* **Location:** Seoul, South Korea
* **Goal:** 42 minutes
* **Actual:** 39:34

I was a fat kid growing up and I despised running because I was fat not good at it. I started running in May this year and at the end of July got my 10k down to 45 minutes, but then I moved to the other side of the world and didn't run any in August. On August 31, I signed up for a 10k in November and, the next day, started running again. I ran a 10k or more everyday before that race and then blew myself away with my time.

The last 300m of the race was right after turning a corner and, when I turned the corner, I could see that the clock over the finish line had not reached 40 minutes yet. Every ounce of adrenaline in my body got used in the next 30 seconds and I sprinted through the finish line with tears welling up in my eyes. 

Until that moment I had still considered myself the fat kid or the fat friend, but when I looked up at my time as I crossed, I knew that a fat kid couldn't do that. I walked to a bench in the adjacent park and looked at the sun coming up behind the giant office buildings that I had just running alongside of and started crying. I never in my life thought I would be able to run like that and I was absolutely overjoyed. 

My friends, however, do not exercise ever, definitely don't know anything about running, and were therefore incredibly apathetic about my results. So, /r/running, please, celebrate with me! In only 39 minutes and 34 seconds, I got rid of the fat , and brought on the fit!

And I ask to you, what's the most excited you've ever been about a completed run? What did you do to celebrate or bask in your happiness?",running

Here's the Clif's Notes version:

Booneville Backroads Ultra - 100 Mile (Covid) Edition  (http://boonevillebackroadsultra.com/)
102.5 miles - 28hrs 10min  5th male, only 9 finished, out of 24 starters (7 men, 2 women).

Weather started out cool, but the temps hit the low 90's by afternoon and stayed there until about 6:00 PM with no clouds and little wind.  Stayed in the upper 70's through the finish.

I hit a few low points; most notably at ~50 miles and ~80 miles, but managed to work through it. I became intimately in tune with the complete mental screw game a race of this distance turns into later in the game.  I had an idea of what it would be like from training, but the magnitude of it was intense.

All said though, I felt pretty positive the whole time.  In fact, on the first and second 50k loops I was singing along with my music, and on the last leg I was telling delirium fueled dad jokes to my pacers (much to their amusement).

I am friends/acquaintances with a few of the runners, whom are much better runners than me, that DNF'd, and I am in shock that I managed to finish where a few of them didn't.  That sounds like I'm casting shade at them, but I think my relatively slower pace at the start saved me versus some of their faster starts once the heat turned up.

Lastly, by the last 20ish miles walking and running hurt about the same, so I tried to run as much as possible at the end.  It went better than I expected.

The last aid station had Mountain Dew pancakes, which were freaking amazing.  Mana from the running gods.  

Anyway, I had a blast!  I worked my ass off to get to this point in my running life.  I had a ton of support from my family and friends.  I can't begin to express the level of gratitude I have for them helping and even encouraging my insanity.  

I know 100 milers aren't for everyone, but if you can manage the highs and lows of training and running it, it is worth it.

182,1616592070.0,Are you a runner that waves at other folks you encounter?,"I've been running for a longish time consistently (5days, 50ish miles a week).  I for the most part wave (95+% of the time) at other people I encounter (bikers, runners, walkers, dog owners) even when in the midst of intervals or speedwork.  

About 50% of the time people don't wave back or acknowledge others presence when out and about. 

I this has gotten worse during CoVid where folks are turning away, moving off trail (keep singletrack single) or other behaviors to avoid interaction even when there is 6+ feet between us and/or both masked.

183,1536257734.0,I figured out how to run with my 6 kids!,"Here's the problem.  When you have a large family, there is no easy way to take everyone running.  There are jogging strollers, but most of those can only hold 2 kids.  Some can hold 3.  I've found running with jogging strollers is miserable.  They don't track straight and your constantly picking up the front end and correcting the direction your running.

I started looking at pony trailers.  Could I use one of those to haul my kids around?  No, not really.  They are pricey and heavy.  Then I looked to Asia and their rickshaws.  Those looked awesome!  Finding one in the states was very difficult.  When I found one, they were pricey. Like thousands of dollars pricey.

I started wondering if I could build one.  The main problem I was worried about was me.  I'm more of a computer guy then handyman.  Wrenches, drills, bits, washer, all that I left to my wife.  She loves that kind of stuff.

Anyway, I decided to woman up and be more like my wife.  I gave this project a shot.  I took a bike trailer, and I pulled the arm of the trailer that connects to the bike off the trailer.  I even used wrenches and stuff!  Then I tried all kinds of ways to pull the dumb thing.  Straps, bungies, roc straps, nothing worked.  With some help from my wife (she's not scared of drills and saws) we came up with using PVC pipe for the handles!  With a bunch of strong zip ties, I had a homemade rickshaw!  And it works awesome.

Now that I was used to drills I decided to try and add a second bike trailer to the back of the first one.  I drilled a hole in the frame of the front trailer (I Googled to see if this was a good idea or not.  Nothing.  Google failed me.) and bolted a bike hitch to the back of the front trailer.  Did you know that there are stores with rows and rows of different size bolts?  It was amazing.

Now I was able to have two trailers connected to each other!  Shoot, if it worked for 2 trailers, why not 3?  And you know what?  It works!

Here are a few notes.  Just one trailer tracks and runs fine.  I've ran over 400 miles with the front trailer.  I find I run faster pulling a trailer that then pushing a jogging stroller.  When I add a second trailer it still pulls pretty good.  Loading kids is tricky.  Some kids fight with each other and I want heaver kids in the front to help balance how much the PVC handles push up.

Each trailer weighs about 20lbs or so.  Loaded up with all my kids and trailers I'm pulling about 150-200lbs behind me.  On flats is doable.  But any hill, and I mean the smallest ant hill takes me to a crawl and bumps my heart rate up to Zone 5.

Totally happy I did this.  I hope it inspires other parents to take their kids out running!

184,1585779211.0,"My journey from overweight (5'11""-215 lbs) to a 2:45 marathon","I know my title is a bit clickbaity. My goal is that you understand that anyone can do this. If you're fat, you can get fit...and fast. If you're fast, you can get faster. If you're content... rock on, Keep on running! I've come across a lot of fixed mindsets on this sub... especially as it pertains to qualifying for Boston or getting faster. I hope this post helps dispel some of that. There have been countless posts on this sub that have helped and inspired me. This community is so awesome. I hope that I can give back by inspiring one of you to keep on going!

So as the title suggests, I wasn't always a runner. I consider myself naturally athletic but not anything outside the norm. In January of 2014, I was 23yrs old and 215lbs. Probably \~25-30% body fat. [That's me](http://i.imgur.com/WU0Ih2X.jpg),[That's me again](http://i.imgur.com/jO7yV5I.jpg). Enough is enough, amirite? I had a come to Jesus with myself. So I started running - and hated it. That feeling when your body is jiggling and itchy was the absolute worst. Overweight people know the struggle. It sucked. Some of you reading this are at this point. Anytime I see someone at this stage running I want to jump out of my car and hug them! In my heart I cheer them on! ""Don't you quit, keep on going!"" The thing is...you don't know what lies ahead in a week, or month, or year...but I do! I've been there! To those of you reading this right now who fall in this category... Keep going! It gets better. You've heard that a million times... but it's true! I dare you to prove me wrong. 

 I've been running ever since 2014. 6yrs later and still going strong. To date, I've dropped from 215lbs down to 160lbs and just finished my 11th marathon. It's been a journey. I started out at 25MPW and have worked my way up to \~45-50MPW (training typically gets me up to 70MPW)

**2014** \- Ran my first marathon in 4:07 on \~30MPW. Grateful for the opportunity and time. 

**2015** \- Ran my 2nd marathon in 3:37 on \~40MPW. I was consistent all year and it paid off. Boston wasn't on my radar at all, but I was glad to see 30 min shaved off my time. 

**2016** \- No Marathon, but ran my normal 35MPW. Didn't follow any plan. 

**2017** \- Shit got real. Was introduced to Pete Pfitzinger's training plans. This was the year that Boston entered my mind as a possibility. Picked the 18/70 plan and went to work. I'm not going to lie, that training plan is brutal, relentless, and painful. But it works. This was the hardest I had ever trained and felt like I was pushing my body to the very limit. [Ran a 3:02 marathon](http://i.imgur.com/6kOIsul.jpg). 

**2018** \- Actually gained weight this year (I struggle to not eat like I'm still 215...even to this day). Probably ballooned up to 180ish. Ran 3 marathons not for time. Mid 3's. Kinda a pretty chill running year. 

**2019** \- Dusted off Pete Pfitzinger again... that glorious masochist. Followed it to a tee and ran the Phoenix marathon in 2:54. Broke that sub 3! Lot's of folks have that as a goal. Pete will get you there. The big thing is just...miles. The more miles you put in, the more you are prepared. After the 2:54, I decided I was done chasing PR's. 2:54 for a dude that used to be 215lbs requires a lot. Tack on a career, kids, and work travel... I was pretty content. Until...in fall of 2019, a friend asked me a  question: **""What if you did?""** Simple words. Simple question. But....man. That had such an impact on me. I again, got aquatinted with Pete for the 3rd time now. 

**2020** \- January through March was all out. 5am runs. Threshold, lactate, recovery, HITT, Vo2... you name it. I was determined. I got really strict on my diet (back down to 160) and was ready to roll! Until...COVID! Marathon canceled. Great. Screw it, I guess I'll have to do this alone. So I did. I ran that St. George Marathon course in southern Utah. Goal was to PR and get sub 2:50. Everything worked out and I felt perfect. No wall, no pain. Last 5 miles were sub 6min pace. [2:45!

189,1621083967.0,"People who are no longer seriously overweight due to running, what is your story?","Here’s a story from me:

Last year I was around 280 pounds. I took up running at the end of October..although ‘running’ is a generous description for what I was doing the first couple months. More like stumbling and wheezing and trying not to throw up, 10 minutes per km. I’ve run five times a week ever since.

Today I was feeling super motivated after dropping under 240 pounds for the first time since 1993 so I decided to do a big run! 

I wanted to set a new record of 8 miles / 13km in under 6:15 per km pace. 

After the first 5km I realised I felt amazing. I just couldn’t believe how good I felt. It was like I was an athlete or something. 

My whole life I’ve been so obese, and also a chronic smoker until last August. I was thinking about this compared to how good I was feeling while running today and I felt so overwhelmed I started tearing up a bit and had to stop, I guess it was happiness mixed with regret that I left it so late in my life to experience exercise like this. After a few moments I realised I was ruining my pace time so I set off again faster than ever!

When I finally made it to the sea and couldn’t run any further I collapsed on the sand and looked at my time - and shouted out loud in joy. I know this is tortoise speed to many of you but this is my best ever.

So if you saw a fat 40yo dude on his knees at the beach today pumping his fists in the air like Rocky and cheering this is the back story.

I don’t post too much in this sub, but I read it every night and everything I know about running comes from here. Thanks to all of you for inspiring me so much. 

I’d love to hear stories from people who took up running to lose a lot of weight, and how it’s going for you these days and how much your times have improved?

190,1641158406.0,Is anyone else obsessed with running even though they are kind of slow and not so good at it?,"In March of 2020 I had to quarantine for 14 days after coming back from Berlin (I guess sharing gelato with strangers at Berghain really does catch up to you). The world was beginning to shut down and through my isolation I was desperate for fresh air and going stir crazy in my house. So when my 14 days were up, I took a walk outside and discovered there was a track a few miles away from my house. And I started going every day. I started running one mile a day on the track. Then I worked up to running two miles a day on the track. And eventually I was plateauing at 2 miles for almost a year. 

Then came 2021, I moved to a new neighborhood and I started running in pavement instead of a track. I started adding more distance to my runs and trying to challenge myself. Eventually I was able to run 6 miles, granted at paces between 10-11 minute miles. I then injured my knee and went to physical therapy for 4 weeks. When I saw other people running, I got so jealous, so I made sure to do my PT exercises and I was able to rehabilitate my knee. I learned the importance of foam rolling my quads everyday, stretching, and replacing your shoes the hard way. 

So now I checked my total miles for last year on the Nike running app was 1,589, 245 runs, 11'53"" was my average pace, and I spent 314:56 hours on the app. In the beginning of the 2021 I made a resolution of doing a \~8 minute mile at  least once. That did not happen, but I am not upset about it. I have been able to add 8 mile runs to my routine without throwing me off. I actually like the pace that I run at because it allows me to get out there 5 times a week without feeling tired and be consistent. I also love how meditative it is for me. I love getting so lost in an idea or thought that eventually you realize you are not thinking about anything at all. I love the people I see everyday on my runs who we now exchange a wave or hello with everyday. I love embracing the rain, sun and wind. 

My goal for 2022 is to go on some longer runs \~10 miles or maybe even a half marathon. I would love to improve my pacing but I guess that's not so much of a priority anymore. I would also love to get more comfortable running in group settings.",running

I don’t have much to add because the title states it all. I started running in March. For reference, I’m a 27 y/o female who was relatively fit going into it but the extent of my running experience was treadmill jogging to burn off cals. 

My first outside run was 2 miles long and I remember it being the hardest thing ever. Since then, I focused on increasing my weekly mileage and the distance of my long runs and incorporated some hill runs (unintentionally because I live by a lot of hills but it really helped at the end of all this). Because races had been canceled, I organized my own half marathon with the help of relatives. They passed me water at designated mileage posts and cheered me on. This was my first running race ever and I completed it in 1:57. It was so fun and I can’t wait to do a real race with other runners!
Here are stats and cute photos from the day:

A huge thanks to this sub. I didn’t know a thing about long distance running and training before and I would have been lost without knowledge and motivation from this sub.

Now that I completed this, what should I do to maintain my running endurance and strength? I want to sign up for a half marathon when they’re back but I live in a northern state so races won’t be happening until April/may. I don’t mind working back up to half marathon distance in the spring but is there a weekly mileage and long run distance I should be hitting at minimum to maintain what I’ve gained?

Edit: will respond to comments tomorrow. I got drunk to painfully make it through the presidential debate and can’t formulate heartfelt responses at the moment. Goodnight

Edit 2: thank you for all the positive encouragement and love! since this post has gotten some attention, I’m going to use this platform real quick to point out some less than great things about being a female runner. 
1. Being catcalled by pedestrians and car passengers. Happens at least three times a week. And I live in a rural town. Even if they don’t physically Catcall, a lot of people just stare. Very intensely. It’s absurd. This happens really really frequently. Like maybe every 10-20 or so cars that pass by. People be starin. 
2. People just fucking w me. I was running along the side of a road today going in the same direction as traffic and some smart ass sitting on the passenger seat of a beater decided to roll his window down, stick his whole upper body out of the car, and scream at the top or his lungs as they passed me. I swear If I had a water bottle on hand, I would have chucked it at his face. 
Also happened today, car decided to honk at me right as they passed me. Not before as a warning to say they were coming up behind me but nope, right as they were lined up w me. Just to startle me or something. 
The other day, a car slowed way down and came right up behind me and just followed me for maybe 4 or 5 paces at my speed. Maybe 3-4 dumb kids in the car all just laughing their faces off while doing this thinking they were so clever and funny? 

Maybe it’s a sign that I shouldn’t be running along side the road but I don’t have much choice around here. Or people should just leave female runners alone. I know you guys know not to do this to other runners so this isn’t the best platform for this but my goodness, can this be brought up as a national issue somehow? End rant.",running

193,1627258138.0,I made it 12 miles today!!,"I'm in such happy tears as I write this because six months ago I could not run at all. I could sometimes barely walk.

I've spent many years being pretty disabled, having serious chronic pain to the point that I could not carry a carton of orange juice in a bag home from the grocery store without then doing an hour of yoga to undo the back and body ache. I would wake up crying in the middle of the night from my back pain. I was frail and easily injured doing normal things. I also had a wide variety of (seemingly unrelated) other health problems, from really bad eczema to severe anxiety and depression. I'm in my early 30s and I always expected that even though I was doing all I could to take care of my health, things would only get worse as I continued to age.

And then I finally met a doctor who figured out what was wrong with me. He sent me for tests, and was the first doctor to specifically check my vitamin D levels. It turns out I was severely vitamin D deficient. The doctor was being professional but I could tell he was stunned as his intern read out my astonishingly low level. He explained to me how addressing this could be the key to my various health problems. I did some reading up on vitamin D and was cautiously hopeful as I got the supplements.

The first thing I noticed weeks later was that I could walk without knee pain. Then I started jogging, overjoyed to be able to do that. I became strong enough to reach the park and dreamed of being able to get far enough to go in. Over these months, all the aforementioned problems I’ve had (and a dozen others) cleared up either 100% or mostly. And I got farther and farther into the trail.

Going out there is one of the most wonderful things I’ve ever experienced, and part of it is because the park is gorgeous and fun, but part of it is that I now have the mental health to feel happy. I can energetically enjoy things so much more easily. I love looking at leaves! I love watching what a lil animal is doing! I love being outside in the sunlight!

When I’m out there I do a combo of running, jogging, and walking. And I started completing the trail! Or so I thought. The other day I ran a little farther past the abrupt looking end of the trail and crossed the street, and realized the trail is actually dramatically longer. I loved that there was more to discover and went pretty far, admiring all the new stuff to look at, then came home hype about the idea of going even farther next time.

Cut to me this morning waking up hungover from my bad decisions. My head was dazed but I decided to power through it and go on my morning run. I didn’t feel great but I felt okayish. I was well into the trail when I decided to drink water for the first time. My stomach hated that and I immediately felt nauseated and super dizzy. I respect nature and would like to have not had to throw up in the forest, but I was like, “Okay this is happening I’m gonna throw up in the forest”. I was at a part where barely anyone is ever at, so I was about to throw up when this lady comes around the bend. I was inching very slowly as we passed each other, looking disoriented and attempting to hold it together long enough to not throw up in front of her. She looked at me in nonjudgmental confusion about my weird energy. On the occasion that I’ve realized I must vomit, I also do this silly little “dancing on hot coals” thing to upset my stomach enough to get it over with, and I didn’t want to look like even more of a weirdo by doing it in front of her.

Then, way behind her, a dog appeared. “He’s okay, he’s with me!” she called. The dog was nice and well behaved. But now they were really meandering, and I couldn’t play it cool any longer so I started dry heaving. She was really concerned but I gratefully thanked her for offering help and told her I’d be fine. I couldn’t vomit but after walking it off for a while I felt okay enough to start running again. I had to drink water maybe 3 more times on the run, and each time I felt nauseated again, but was able to just walk until the feeling passed. Outside of those moments, I felt okay.

I made it really far into the trail and had a great time. Also, I had realized it was cute whenever the occasional person gave me a friendly wave, so I had decided for this run I was going to wave at a bunch of people (a thing my anxiety would have definitely not allowed me to do before). They all waved back and it was cool to share some good vibes.

The last 10 minutes to my house were extremely grueling because the nausea came back in full force. But I made it home. Vomited immediately. Laid there dizzy.

When I checked my running app, I was so blown away when it said I did a total of 12 miles *and* it was my fastest. I’ve been learning to challenge myself to mentally and physically keep going even when I want to slow down. And I thought it was really ironic that the most rigorous and accomplishment-filled day of exercise of my whole entire life was also a day where I physically felt this way. 

I feel so overjoyed every day that this is my body now. Once I get my next vitamin D level results (my primary doctor is now my point person), I plan to message the other doctor for helping me completely transform my health and start living a life with this much joy in it.",running

I’ve been running longer distances comfortably at 9:30-10 mins per mile pace for the past couple weeks. I’ve also done a few intervals runs.

Today I ran 9 miles at a 9:50 pace and felt pretty good!

If you’re first starting out, don’t worry about time at all. If you try to run fast, you’ll burn out quick. In the past, I always wanted to run, but was so focused on getting a good time that I could never do more than a mile without gasping for air. Then I would try to beat my previous time the next run which compounded the problem and made me think I wasn’t cut out for running and just quit.

I must also mention some of the fantastic posts on here from others stories was a huge boost at times.

One thing I've learnt after this is that I have the absolute biggest respect for people who do marathons and even more than that. This is something I won't be taking up personally, I will now look to reduce the miles slightly and look to improve 5, 10k speeds.

But my question, what's an acceptable time to have off now? With Easter coming up I'm looking to relax a bit. I have been so strict with my diet and training I think I deserve it. I obviously don't want to fall off the waggon completley! Is 1-2 weeks acceptable?

In the spring I weighed 235 (max I had pushed), over the summer I dropped to 175 and today set a new personal record. 

Edit, being asked about my diet:

Breakfast usually consists of half a cup of yogurt, half a cup of granola and strawberries or an english muffin with a fried egg, if I am on the run rye bread with pb&j. Lunch at the beginning was two rice cakes with tomatoes, cucumber and half a pepper (red / green) now I have replaced the rice cakes with rye bread, lettuce, and cheese and still eat the veggies. Dinner I cut potatoes (grew up in a meat & potato family) and replaced with salads and went to a quarter pound of red meat a week now mostly chicken and fish. The biggest though being pasta. I love spaghetti but its all about the sauce not the noodles. Bought a spiralizer and I now have zucchini rather than pasta. I also stopped drinking. I was having at least two beers every night during the week and more during the weekend. I also drink at least 5-10L of water a day. 

The biggest change was using the app called Lose It! Just used the free features and it worked. As I lost weight and talked to people they all said its never about the calroies its about the weight of the food, its about the type of food you are eating. The app tells you how much you need to eat in order to lose weight. Starting I was at 2400 calorie intake, once I reached 180 to lose the last 5 pounds I was down to 1700 calories a day. The first morning I started the app I had my regular breakfast and when I saw how many calories were in a cup of orange juice I drastically changed my diet. 

Exercise was trying to run every day. With work its hard to match that if I couldn't run I would at least go for an hour walk. I had found a few years ago when I lost a little bit of weight it was changing up the exercise. Not doing the same exercise every single day.

207,1617311893.0,My results running for one year with Chronic Heart Failure,"Hey, I thought you guys might be interested in my experience of training for a year while suffering from a chronic heart condition called Left Ventricle Heart Failure. While only a sample of one person, you might be surprised by the medical results achieved!

&nbsp;

I suffered a heart attack while working out in a gym 3 years ago at the tender age of 35. It was a terrible experience that I would not wish on anyone. Crushing chest pain, breathlessness and the anxiety of looking at the worried faces of those around me. I work in a hospital and only had mild symptoms while leaving the gym, I felt like I was having a panic attack. By the time I got to work I could barely speak and just made it through the door before the doctors and nurses I work with jumped into action. I had a ‘complete occlusion of the left anterior descending artery’ or ‘the widow maker’ heart attack – so called because it has a poor survival rate if left untreated for a short period of time. Long story short, I was treated quickly, thus surviving, but being left with a severely impaired left ventricle.

&nbsp;

Some important definitions for those not medically trained. The left ventricle is the heart chamber that supplies the oxygenated blood to your whole body, it is the biggest and strongest part of your heart. Mine was deprived of oxygen for a period and thus muscle cells died. They can’t regenerate so instead scar tissues form. This scar impairs how well the heart can pump blood. How doctors measure the impairment is called ‘the ejection fraction’. This is important for later so bear with me. Even the best heart will not pump all the blood in the chamber in one beat. Typically, at rest, a heartbeat will push out about 50 – 70% of the blood in the chamber, it refills, the heart beats again pushing 50-70% blood out… repeat until death. If a heart is damaged and pushes out less than 50% you have heart failure. It varies by country and cardiology organisations, but roughly 40-50% is classified as mildly impaired, 30-40% moderately, 20-30% severe and sub-20% end stage or needing transplant (If you are a medic please don’t @ me, I know this is a massive simplification and classification varies). My ejection fraction after my heart attack was 29%, so I was at the higher end of severe. 

&nbsp;

Recovery for me took place in three rough categories, physiological recovery, pharmacological adaptation and rehabilitation. These overlap a lot, but by a strange twist there where clear moments in my recovery when one aspect predominated. In the first year I was undergoing mostly physiological recovery, when the heart adapts to the damage that has been done. Part of the heart enlarges a bit (not too much luckily for me, as this can cause more problems) and becomes more efficient at pumping. In this year, my left ventricle ejection fraction improved from 29 to 35%, up into the moderate category. 

&nbsp;

Then in year two it was a change in medication that led to an improvement. I met the criteria for a ‘new’ medication (it wasn’t new, just two types combined, but my doctor said it had good results with improving heart function). With this change my ejection fraction improved to 38%, getting close to the mild category!

&nbsp;

At the start of year three I had some big changes in my life. I was expecting my first child, and my wife and I had moved. I wanted to get back exercising like I did before, lifting weights, running, hiking. I was active, but in the back of my mind I was nervous about exercising, the heart attack had happened in the gym after all! My doctor kindly did a stress echo, a type of heart scan while exercising to see how my heart performed under strain. It involves getting into a cool bike that rotates onto it’s side and as the resistance increases, making me work harder, the doctor scanned my heart. I got good news, my heart performed well, and while my resting ejection fraction remained around 38%, while exercising I was able to pump out at about 45%.

&nbsp;

From this I got the mental green light to get back exercising that I needed. I met with an exercise physiologist and we talked about strategy. I had already completed the C25K so he advised on adding intervals, some cross training and how to manage my significant breathlessness and fatigue. For the next year I rang religiously 3 times a week. 2x 30 min runs and one ‘long run’, that I built up to 60 minutes. For the first 6 months I did a mixture of intervals and a pace run on the short days, while I just tried to build miles on the longer run. For the second half of the year I just went at a steady pace as I now ran with my son in a buggy. Overall, in the year my average mile pace dropped from 10 to 9mins and my PB was 8:30mins over 5K. 

&nbsp;

The outcome? My last scan showed that my ejection fraction had increased from 38 to 48%, the biggest improvement I’d seen over the three years and placing me well into the mild heart failure category. An improvement of 20% on my baseline! I find this an amazing result. Year three is long past when the heart would have had natural recovery, and I’d been on the same medication for nearly 2 years. Running was the only change I had made that year!

208,1594731502.0,Did anyone else take up Running during a hard point in their lives?,"Back in March, when the world fucking changed. I was a sad SAHM in an abusive relationship begging to be loved and cared for. I had no worth. I had nothing. All my extra family help suddenly couldn't and I was alone with my monster of an ex. 

I've had much much much more happen in my life but I'm sure any new parents know that even if your relationship is healthy, a baby really stresses you out for a bit. No shame guys, it's a learning time for both baby and parents and that's normal. I just gotta say that because I felt like a huge failure and I don't know if anyone else needs to be reminded right now.

Anyways. I started to run in March. It sucked and it hurt but I saw it as hurt that was good, because I was gaining a better life from it. I changed all my eating habits too, and made this my lifestyle. I was overweight but not dangerously so, I just needed to change and so I did.

It's July. I run 6-9k with my son in his stroller usually (he naps, isn't awake for all of it, it's a great time for us both) , actively enjoying choosing healthier options, have kicked out the deadbeat ex, started court proceedings and am piecing my whole world back together. I will not attribute my success to just running, but I will say it helped me so fucking much to gather all my strength to do what my son needed me to. I felt power, control, and confidence with my running as I learned how to master it.  I am thankful because it's my meditation and so many empowering self-convos have happened while listening to Kendrick Lamar and focusing on that breathing.

I live in N.C. so it may be cooler outside but the humidity can be very uncomfortable. Half through my run I stop at a water station to cool off and take my shirt off exposing my sports bra from underneath. As I take my shirt off I hear a man from the trail yell at me through the woods “ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!”. He was biking by and had a kid strapped in a trailer behind him. We made eye contact and I just stood there in shock as he stared me down biking by. 

I see a lot of men and women running this specific trail with no shirts on so I didn’t think it was a big deal. I’m not sure how to feel about this. But I can’t help but feel incredibly anxious that this guy was yelling at me because I was changing down into a sports bra to not over heat. 

Was I being insensitive? 

Edit. Thank you all for your responses, love and support!!! I have just started running in my sports bra and feeling comfortable with it.

210,1626059637.0,"Joined a running group, left feeling bad.","This probably isn’t the place for this post. I’m a socially anxious person who has trouble with large groups of people after an early life of teasing and bullying. That doesn’t stop me from working on myself and doing things that are out of my comfort zone. 

So I joined a running group and did my first run with them today - a crew of around 70 people. I started off strong, started talking to 1 person as we began, but she didn’t seem interested in chatting and hung back to join a pod that had formed behind me. I found myself feeling rather alienated as we ran, as the bigger group formed multiple little groups and were chatting and 
making friends, while I was left alone in between them. It made me feel invisible and pointless just like I used to feel in school. At the end of the run, everyone went to a bar, and I just had the overwhelming desire to run away and go home. So I’m kicking myself to say that I did. 

I know I definitely could have done more to engage and try to break in, but as a shy person, sometimes I need help. I need to be invited in. I get the sense that the running community is pretty extroverted.. or maybe it’s just the ones who join groups, but I guess that I assumed that it would be a more welcoming place. 

Not sure what the purpose of this post is other than to say that most introverts and shy people aren’t quiet because they don’t want to socialize, sometimes they just need a little help. That person standing by themselves isn’t standoffish, they are having an existential crisis and need to be snapped out of it.

215,1617552535.0,"Turns out, I hated running because I was pushing myself too hard.","This subreddit has changed my life! I’ve always wanted to enjoy running because it’s a convenient way to get some exercise, enjoy time to myself, and take in nature. But every time I’ve tried to get serious about it, I’ve hated every second of it.

I read a lot of posts in this thread and heeded the advice of long-term runners to take it slow and easy. I created a weekly training program where I alternate between a day of interval running/walking and a day with a long walk, one day off, and one day for a slow and easy “long run.”

And now, I LOVE running! I seriously can’t wait for the days I actually get to run.

Here are my biggest takeaways from this approach:

1. Integrating short walking breaks into my runs makes all the difference. It’s easier to tell myself I can run for 8 minutes and then get a 2 minute break over dreading having to run for 20 minutes straight.

2. Alternating between days of running and days with long walks also makes running seem more doable. I don’t get as burnt out. This also goes for taking a day off.

3. Taking an easy, conversational pace, especially on my long run days, allows me to actually enjoy the experience and focus my attention on my form and breathing instead of on whether I’m hitting a certain pace. It gives me the freedom to go a little harder if I’m feeling good or take it a little easier if I’m struggling that day.

4. Slowly adding more time and distance feels easier on my body and gives me long-term goals to look forward to. In the past, I always felt like I had to go faster or longer with each successive run, which only frustrated me when I felt good one day and off another. Thinking more long-term feels healthier both physically and mentally to me.

Again, I’m so thankful I found this subreddit and have finally been able to find a way to make running feel enjoyable!",running

And that you get nothing at all out of a long slow run. So over the course of this training plan I can’t say that I enjoy running but now I feel compelled to run even on my rest days which is pretty unheard of for me. 

Today the plan culminated with the half marathon and I ended up averaging a pace that’s under 10 minutes a mile. Very happy with it. But I feel like if I want to do this again in the future, the half marathon is going to be “my race.”

Have any of you decided that you would rather focus on improving one specific race and forgo any idea of continuing to add distance? A buddy of mine at work runs ultramarathons and he thinks that it’s nuts to stop at a half. He says that a marathon is obviously the natural progression but for me I would like to end up running a half marathon in two hours or less one day.

220,1533145354.0,Things I learned running at 5:00 in the morning,"I did it you guys. Today is the day I finally woke my sorry ass up at the crack of dawn to go running. It was surprisingly less of a struggle than expected. There is definitely a huge feeling of accomplishment in getting your workout done and over with, first thing in the morning. I won't say I'm a convert yet, but I realized there are some definite benefits to wake up early. For instance:
  
- So. Many. Bunnies. For real, it was insane! I saw 8 and I was only outside for 25 minutes. If cute bunnies don't start your morning off right, I don't know what can.  
- You get to run IN THE STREET! I felt like Kramer with the entire open road ahead of me. It was like I was running my own personal 5K. Also, I didn't feel nearly as bad about spitting as I do when I'm on the sidewalk.  
- I had so much extra time in the morning to get shit done. Normally, I roll out of bed when my son wakes up (between 6:30-7:00) and rush to get us out the door. After my run this morning, I unloaded AND loaded the dishwasher, packed lunches, and tweezed my eyebrows all before 6:30. It was glorious. (well, as glorious as doing dishes can be)  

I mean, I won't lie, it wasn't all sunshine and roses. Waking up that early SUCKS and my knees were definitely creaking during the entire first 1/2 mile or so, but I also feel really proud of myself. Being disciplined is not my strongest quality, but it's something I really hope to work on. Thanks to all my fellow morning sloggers for giving me the inspiration to make it happen!",running
221,1635786491.0,Get comfortable with being uncomfortable,"This is one of the more valuable skills I've learned since I began running four years ago. (39M) [edit] Especially when we spend the majority of our lives avoiding being uncomfortable.

It's been on my mind a lot lately during my runs and thought it might be a helpful piece of advice for new or experienced runners. I see a lot of posts from new runners asking what to do when the weather isn't perfect, what to wear when it's 50F to keep from being slightly chilly, etc. A lot are valid concerns for people without experience, but what I would encourage those people to do is accept the fact that they will be uncomfortable. If it's cold, you will be uncomfortable for at least part of the run no matter what you wear. Same if it's raining. Accept that it won't always be fun but go out and run anyway.

The mental toughness you can develop by pushing through being uncomfortable time after time will pay dividends not only in your running, but in your daily life.",running

224,1636399007.0,Obese to Sub 3 hour Marathoner,"Throwaway because there’s some identifiable information in here.

[Results and Progress Pics](https://imgur.com/a/eUy2uUG)

Yesterday I ran the New York City Marathon and I broke 3 hours. It was my 3rd marathon and first NYC. 5 years ago I was 50 lbs heavier, completely out of shape and unmotivated to anything active, but continually upset about my weight. I played hockey in high school and once I got to college I had a little too much fun.

In March of 2016 I got convinced that signing up for a half would be a good way to get into shape. I figured signing up would get me moving. It sort of did. I was not prepared and cramped terribly and hobbled along finishing with a time of 2:35. I didn’t want that to be my only half marathon experience, but I also wasn’t ready to take on what it took to improve.

March of 2018 I had started trying to actually get into shape. I had lost about 20 lbs, thought I was fit (I was not) and decided that it would be a good idea to just jump up to a full marathon. I again had no clue what I was doing and a similar situation occurred and I hobbled with debilitating calf cramps the last 10 miles to come in at 4:45.

The summer of 2019, I finally made a real and conscious decision to get into shape. I lost 30 more lbs, I got serious about my diet. Did HIIT training, lifted smartly and ran. I was unfamiliar with running slow to run fast etc.  All my runs were the same pace and wasn’t training that smart, but I was making improvements. I signed up for a half in Disney, I was hoping for 1:45, I came in at 1:39. After having a race that went well I realized how fun they can be. I made the decision then I was going to find a way to go sub 3 in a full and BQ.

Gyms shut down in March 2020 due to COVID and I dove into this sub to figure out how to increase volume and get faster. So I upped my volume slowly to 50-60 miles a week. Then in July I had a freak accident playing old man softball, I needed surgery on my foot.

I rehabbed slowly, got back up to the 50-60 miles a week and decided to sign up for a full marathon in April of 2021. I didn’t have any overly ambitious goals. I wanted to break 3:25 and enjoy the race and reassess when I would make a BQ attempt. I came in at 3:19 and was pumped.

I decided Rehoboth marathon in Delaware in December would be the day. Things changed though when I was given an opportunity to run NYC. With a shortened timeline and a difficult course. I upped the volume peaking at 80 miles per week for 3 week span before I started coming down.

Everything said in here about the difficulty of the logistics, the Queensboro Bridge and 5th ave are 1,000% true. I barely held on after a 1:28:05 first half.

I don’t think it’s enough for Boston, but I’ll still apply and it’s still sub 3. If I need another marathon time for 2023, I’ll be sure to pick a flatter course. Thank you to everyone on this sub, this community has helped me stay healthy and learn to slow down to run fast!",running
225,1584285775.0,4 years of running and just completed my first sub 1.30 half and feel over the moon!,"I started running 4 years ago when I was feeling a bit lost in life. I was overweight, not being a particularly good husband or father and struggling with depression.

Running completely changed my life, it helped me find a new focus that fed into so many different parts of my life, lose weight and I remember feeling such a sense of accomplishment when I ran my first half 4 years ago! 

Today I achieved a goal that I never thought I'd accomplish. I ran the Stafford Half marathon in the UK and finished with a time of 1.28.20. I'd been training for distance as I got to a point where I couldn't get past the 1.33 point and decided to focus on distant instead. The weather wasn't great it was windy and showering when we started so I figured I'll just have fun with this and if I burn out, I burn out.

I ran the first half mile chasing the 1.30 marker and surprisingly caught up and found myself in a small group. The pace felt good and when I checked my watch I couldn't believe that I was on a 6.30 mile average. The doubting side of me left me feeling like that won't last for long so I made a mental commitment not to look again until the 6 mile mark. I stayed with same group and found myself with a smaller group breaking away. When I hit the top of the hill I thought I was back to my normal 7.20 mile point and couldn't believe my eyes when it said 6.26 average.

I spent the next mile distracting myself with the calculations of 'if I slow how fast would I still need to run to break 1.30'. 7 miles came and I'd dropped back to 6.30 with the climb but the goal suddenly seemed achievable knowing I was past the half way point. My legs were feeling strong but my breathing was picking up so I pulled back a little and found myself more comfortably maintaining pace with another runner.

There's a long slog up a slow gradient for 3 miles that I wasn't looking forward to but pushed through to the 10 mile mark with the average dropping to 6.37. the chip time vehicle was at the top of the hill and I saw with 3 miles to go the timer was at 1.08. I could feel my legs fading a bit despite going down a hill and still wasn't 100% at the point where I thought I could do it.

The remaining three miles became a mental game of don't slow by too much but don't over exert by trying to keep up with the couple of runners overtaking me. 

The next thing I remember is hitting the 1k marker and glancing at my watch seeing a 6.42 average but not being able to do the maths to work out how fast I could run 1k but knew it would be close.

When I came round the finish line and saw the timer still on 1.28 it felt incredible and reminded me I need to work on my maths skills. I hadn't even taken into account that I'd start my timer 30 seconds before crossing the start line so getting the chip time through of 1.28.20 was the icing on the cake.

I've lurked this Reddit for sometime and have loved reading others race stories and milestones and I'm delighted that I now have one of my own to share. 😁

Running makes me feel like I'm in control of something when life starts to get out of my hands. It makes me feel like I'm good at something. It makes me feel accomplished as I can set a goal, whether that means to reach a certain time or distance, and watch myself achieve it. It makes me feel mentally tough, there's a certain satisfaction about powering through pain.

Sure, you get the classic ""runner's high"", but to me it feels a lot more deep. I feel like it gives me everything work/relationships currently are not.

As an above average runner who does many group / social runs in town I get ""apologized"" to once in a while. Seriously, I don't attend those events for a hard workout (unless it's the track session I lead each week). I attend because it's fun to chat and hang out with other runners :)

Faster runners look up to slower runners (at least I do). Seriously. You may do a 5k twice as slow as me, but that does not mean you're trying any less hard.

231,1597784853.0,Spontaneously just ran my first 50k,"Haven’t shared yet with anyone else yet, but I’m super psyched so I have to tell some people about it.

How it happened was kind of funny - this past weekend I was at Zion NP and I didn’t know that I had to pay for shuttle access to get into the park (on previous trips I’ve taken, shuttles were free).

Normally I’d just buy a shuttle ticket, but sadly the tickets for shuttle access were sold out for BOTH of the days that I had a campground reserved on.

When I looked at the trail map, I noticed that most of the trails were only ~5-6 miles from my campground.  No problem for a runner right? As I’ve been marathon training this distance seemed like no issue for me and I just laced up and got out there.

So on my first day I ran to the trails, trail ran some trails, and ran back to my campground.  All in all I hit around 13 miles.

On the second day though I had more time - so I ran out to the trails again, and just kept trail running more and more of them.  The trails on Zion are decently short so I had to start running all over the park roads to just get new trails and scenery. About halfway through the day I realized I could hit a 50k if I kept going.  As soon as I realized that I could hit a 50k it was basically a done deal, and I was able to push through the rest of the day and hit a 50K distance in about 11 hours (not that great, but I’ll take it).

Zion had a high of 106 on the first day, and 110 on the second day.  I probably drank more than 4 gallons of water over those 2 days.

Needless to say, I’m pretty pumped and just wanted to share with some people.  I had never ran even a marathon distance before this.  My time was rather long, but I’m excited to try and bring it down some more, and run an official race when possible.",running
232,1639837732.0,Haven't Missed A Day Of Running In Nearly 5 Years And Want To Celebrate,"On January 1st of 2017 I tried to see if I could run three or more miles every day for a month. That month turned into two and I eventually ended up running every day of 2017. After doing it for a year, I figured I could see if I was able to make it two, and then three, and so on. So on December 31st, as long as I can make it, I'll have run at least three miles every day for 5 years and I want to do something to celebrate. I think I've got my route picked out, but I'd love some help figuring out what I should do to celebrate.

Should I invite anyone that wants to join?

Should I contact the news, or is that lame?

It's on new years eve, so is it worth throwing a party, maybe just have some beers afterward?

I'm pretty bad at acknowledging big milestones like this so any help is appreciated!

\*\*\*Edit - Thanks everyone for all of the kind words. A bunch of you asked where I lived.  The main reason I was posting about this run is because for the last 15 years I've lived in the inner city of Milwaukee in the 53206 zip code, to be exact. It is the poorest place in the state of Wisconsin and one of the most incarcerated places in the country. I wanted to plan something on my run to bring a little awareness to what life is like in the inner city. We don't get a ton of positive publicity here so I thought maybe this would be a chance to show off something good happening here. We do a podcast ([https://open.spotify.com/show/7dJ9rlJW6v1NMG0CMe1SEZ](https://open.spotify.com/show/7dJ9rlJW6v1NMG0CMe1SEZ)) about our desire to help all of us rethink our inner city spaces, but this would be the first time trying to raise awareness through running. Because of all of your support, I feel much more confident about running the border of 53206 on 12/31 and inviting anyone that wants to join with me. 

Thanks again for all the kind words!

235,1638407566.0,"I've run 100 of the last 103 days. The Good, the Bad, The Ugly","In the middle of August, I set out to start running again to get my weight under control. At the time I was 253 pounds / 115 kg.  I am 5'11"" / 180 cm, which puts my BMI at 35.3. My high weight earlier in the year was 275, so I had already brought that down a little with some running and elliptical, but I needed to sustain a workout program in order to really bring off the weight.

I have enjoyed running in the past and normally ""run to my heart rate"" so that I can run further. What I mean by this is that I will set my max heart rate to 162 (or 151 on an ""easy"" day) and run for as long as I can, even if this means running slow. While I like running outside, the weather here isn't great (almost always too hot or too cold) and as I have gotten older, I find that running on an indoor track is better for me because it puts less strain on my joints of not having to go up and down on curbs or having to quickly dodge obstacles.

My first run was 5.2 miles in 1 hour 14 minutes. (14:18/mile). In one of the runs in August, I was passed by a woman who was walking fast (not speed walking, just walking fast), but I didn't let that bother me.  Everyone is on their own journey and this was mine. By the end of August, I was really hitting my stride, running 6.6 miles. I decided in September  I was going to run more than 6 miles every day, and I did that, and actually ran more than 90 minutes each day after the 19th, including 4 runs over 2 hours (the longest being 12.56 miles in 2:15:53).

In October, I made an ambitious goal of running more than 90 minutes every day and I accomplished that, with 346 miles in the month, and the best week running 91.7 miles, which worked out to a half-marathon distance every day. My average pace in October was 10:17/mile, so I had obviously come down quite a bit from the start.

For November, my goal went back down to 1 hour a day, but to increase my pace, ending up with 220 miles and a 9:21/mile pace. It's obviously much easier to run without that extra 60 pounds - I'd imagine my run times would be much slower if I wore a 60 pound vest while running.

All together it was 947 miles in 100 runs (which is easy math at 9.47 miles per run)

I also augmented my running with at least 30 minutes on the weight machines at my university gym, and by October I added a morning 15 minute abdominal workout at home before going to the gym. Plus, on many days (5 out of 7 normally), when my wife got off work, we would go back to the gym for an hour on elliptical.  Finally, all of this also coexisted with a disciplined diet of less than 1500 calories on most days - and even as low as 1200 on some - though there were a couple of days when we celebrated a few events (my 49th birthday, my wife's birthday, our anniversary, and her passing the ABIM exam).

# The Good

My **weight** dropped from 253 lbs / 115 kg to 192 lbs / 87 kg.  
**Pant size** went from 42 to 31. I wore size 30 in high school.  
**Shirts** from XXL to M. Same with workout shorts. I used to only wear looser shirts and shorts, but now I am enjoying wearing clothes that fit more snugly.   
**Waist measurement** at belly button went from 44"" in August to 36"" by the end of November. I wish I had measured more things, like hips and thighs, just to see where those dropped ... as well as biceps, and chest which are both seeing muscle gains.  
**Belt size** went from 46 to 36.  
**Wedding ring size** from 12 to 10.5.

**Medical stuff:** 

In May, my **Blood Pressure** was as high as 154/99 with an average of 134/85. This was while I was already on 50 mg Losartan, so my doctor increased that to 100 mg.  By the middle of September, I went back down to 50 mg and by the end of September, I was completely off medication.  My average BP in November, with 63 entries was 109/65.

My **A1C** was 6.4 and came down to 5.7 (within normal range). Apparently that is quite a large jump because my doctor high-fived me when she saw the results. **Glucose** dropped from 165 to 88 (normal range is 74-118). So I was essentially pre-diabetic, to the point where my doctor was close to prescribing metformin, but held off when I told her I thought I could bring down my weight. In fact, when I saw her in May, my weight was 275 and when I saw her again in late October, I was under 200 ... she was quite shocked when she saw me.

My **LDL** cholesterol (the bad one) went from 114 to 99, while my **HDL** cholesterol (the good one) went from 47 to 95. My doctor said she very rarely saw the LDL and HDL to be almost identical, for whatever that is worth. My **triglycerides** were as high as 280 last year and by late October, they dropped to 46 (normal range is less than 150 and high is more than 200). The HDL is a result of the exercise and I think LDL and triglycerides lowering are largely from diet. 

Finally, my **TSH** (thyroid function test) was 5.56 - right on the borderline of high before my doctor started me on medication for hypothyroidism.  By the middle of October, I was off of that medication and will be tested in December to see what my levels are (I was 2.81 in late October, but that was only 10 days off the medication, so she wants to check again after a month or two).

# The Bad

Ok, some of this is going to sound like job interview stuff where a few of the bad's are actually good ... I am saving the real bad things for the Ugly.

I had to buy an entire new wardrobe and it hurt a little to put shirts I just bought in June into the donate bins, but of course I am enjoying wearing my new clothes. None of my belts fit anymore - I went from the last notch on the belt to the tightest. I even bought one of those leather hole punch things, but the belts comically wrapped around my waist.

Same thing with the ring; my ring was platinum, so couldn't be resized and it fell off a couple of times in the shower and after washing my hands.  After seeing a picture she took of me where I unconsciously curled my ring finger to keep my ring from falling off, my wife decided to get me a new ring, which I really like, so we'll call that a draw (it was expensive, but was a nice treat to celebrate the weight loss).

The lowering of my blood pressure is great for health benefits, but a lot of times when I stand up now, I get dizzy, particularly if I have my feet up before standing up. I have to manage that and it kind of sucks, but is better than the alternative. This also affected some of my runs in early September where I started to get dizzy after around 45 minutes and I would have to take a break and drink something before continuing (this was when I was still on blood pressure medication and was the trigger to come off it when my BP started to show up around 95/60).

I am starting to deal with extra skin around the waist, as well as the neck, but I have found a few products that seem to be helping - as well as doing stretches of the neck muscles and sides to try to stimulate those muscles.

Some of my running shirts started to develop an odor. I normally do laundry every 3-4 days and set my wet clothes in the sink in our laundry room (and I sweat a lot), but dri-FIT shirts apparently can collect bacteria that maintain a foul smell that doesn't leave during normal washing.  I started adding about a half cup borax to the laundry and that seems to have brought life back in those shirts.

I have cycled through 2 sets of running shoes and about to close out a third.  I have noticed around the 350 mile mark I will start to have a little but of discomfort in my knees and shins that is immediately relieved with new shoes.

I am cold all the time now.

Sitting near the fireplace or even in my car seat sometimes becomes uncomfortable, I guess because I got used to the extra fat cushion on my butt and now I have more contact with my tailbone and ischium. 

While my diet hasn't been super crazy restrictive (my wife and I do go out once a week to eat out, but normally healthier food like pho), I have cut out most carbs, most meats, most sweets, all alcohol, as well as being very conscious of the calories I am eating and drinking.  Still, I often crave the high-calorie/fat diet that got me in bad shape in the first place. Every time I drive by my favorite fast food restaurant, I want to stop, but I haven't eaten there since August. As time goes on, those cravings have dissipated, but they are still there. I am pretty disciplined about my diet, though, and I log everything I eat into MFP. I am at the point mentally where I think I can stabilize my weight just with diet once I get to my goal.

# The Ugly

This is where I expect to find some discussion. 

First, I have lost 2 toenails and will probably lose a 3rd.  At one point, I thought I might lose 2 more, but easing off the running distance/time in November, coupled with bandaids and Neosporin seem to have saved them for now.

Bleeding nipples are painful and can be embarrassing when wearing lighter colored shirts. I noticed I am more likely to get this condition while wearing some older shirts I have that must be a little rough - as well as if I run a second time in the evening. I haven't yet researched how to best prevent this (I imagine just band-aids, though maybe there are some nipple protectors out there), but I have taken some of my shirts out of my running rotation and the newer ones don't seem to have the problem.

Finally, exercise induce hematuria (marathoner's bladder) was one of the biggest surprises that caused some concern. This was gross (in both slang terms and medical terms since the urine was very, very red). The first time I saw blood in my urine, I had just started wearing compression shorts under my shorts and I thought that might be the cause. Then after going back to my regular setup, I still had it, with one time a small clot developing that I had to piss out.  When it first happened, I told my wife (who is also a doctor). She asked me a series of questions (mainly about the color whether it cleared after rehydrating) and suggested I was dehydrated while running those half-marathon days and since it would clear in about 4-5 hours. She suggested it was probably benign but told me to bring it up at my next medical appointment - which was 10 days from when it started.  So, I started drinking more water before running and it went away.  Still, I let my actual doctor know because my urine sample in late October showed I was ""a little anemic"". I didn't have this problem at all in November due to increased hydration and shorter running distances (though I did run over 90 minutes on 6 days in November).

# What Next?

In November I started to add modified fartleks to my evening workout while my wife does elliptical, where I jog until my heart rate gets to 153, then sprint until I get to 163, then walk until I get back to 140 ... then repeat.  I have done this 6 times for 30-35 minutes each time and it seems to be helping my pace in my longer runs. So I am going to keep doing that, though I might transition to ""true"" fartleks where I sprint for a set distance and then jog for a set distance and repeat. 

I am also going to start trading off between longer, slower runs and faster 6-7 mile runs. I November I set my all-time highs on 5K, 10K, and half-marathon times based on having data in Runkeeper dating back to 2009 (it's probable that I ran faster 5K in college, but I never really got into running longer until I got older. My goal for December is 250 miles, which is roughly 8 a day.

I am going to increase my time on weights and I am considering signing up for a personal trainer certification course offered by my university (I am a doctoral student - retired from the military). I don't really want to be a personal trainer, but I want the education.

My goal weight is 175 pounds (which will put me at a healthy BMI for the first time this century) and I am really hoping to get that by the New Year, though I won't be disappointed if that isn't reached until early next year.

After catching up with the kids, grandad far behind, one of the boys that looked about 6 winked at me and became my silent running buddy. As I found myself needing a walk, he slowed. Once I took off, he tapped my arm and whispered “tag” as he took off too.

240,1560077249.0,"My dad introduced me to running and I fell in love with it. Yesterday, I found out I’ll never be able to run with him again.","I hope this is okay to post here. 

My dad has always been a runner, as far back as I can remember. When I was younger, he started having me run with him on summer evenings. As a kid, I hated it. It wasn’t until I got to college and gained an unhealthy amount of weight that I started running seriously. My school wasn’t far from my house, so he’d drive over and we’d run together in the afternoons. We’d do that every day over the summer of 2016 and I lost 80 pounds as a result of running and dieting. 

I became addicted to running. I loved the feeling of freedom and adventure it gave me. I loved the long runs I’d share with my dad, talking to him about life and venting emotionally while running out the feelings physically. It was quality time with him I’d never get otherwise due to our busy schedules. Now that I’ve moved away and gotten married, I run as often as I can. I still love it. 

Lately, I’ve texted my dad before visiting home, asking if he wants to run when I come up to see him. He always says, “Not yet, my hip just isn’t what it used to be.” Now, for reference, my dad survived a near-fatal car accident in 2008 at the age of 38 when he was (legally and safely) cycling and a truck failed to stop and hit him from the side at a 3-way intersection. The impact shattered his lower two vertebrae, broke his hip, and nearly killed him. Doctors said he wouldn’t walk for two years; through rehab, a fantastic surgeon who put a metal rod through his hip, and enormous amounts of grit, he was up and using a walker in six months. My dad is a fighter. If you saw him today, you’d never know he was in an accident. He went on most of his runs with me AFTER recovering from the accident. 

My mom came to visit me and my wife yesterday and I asked her if Dad would ever be able to run with me again. She told me he wouldn’t. Now at 49, while he can walk and remain mobile, he can’t do high-impact workouts like he used to, even like he did post-accident. Now he spends most of his workouts swimming laps in the pool and lifting weights at the gym. Mom told me that he would never come right out and tell me he won’t be able run with me again because he’d be too heartbroken to say it. Hearing that from her made me cry, and I’ve been processing it ever since. 

Yesterday, I had to say goodbye to my running buddy. I will never stop running and I will never forget how much my dad made me love and appreciate running. He is my closest friend and it’s so hard to accept that the man who taught me how to run will never run with me again. 

But thankfully, I still get a chance to say hello to my new occasional swimming buddy and gym buddy.

EDIT: WOW. I didn’t expect this kind of response. Thank you so much for the silver and gold, and for the kind responses to my story. I’m gonna sit down tomorrow and respond to everyone, but I wanted to say thank you for such a kind and welcoming response to my story, and to clarify that the accident was NEAR fatal.

I was planning on just running my usual distance and calling it good.  About a mile in I see another runner heading the opposite direction of me on the trail.  We both give a polite nod and keep running.We meet again a second time and wave.  This time we both had pretty big grins on our faces.   

I was about to finish my usual allotted time and decided to call it quits once my timer ran out on my phone, but as soon I finished what I had planned to run I thought about the other guy running the other way.  I thought, ""I'll just run until I see him again.""  about a half mile later I see him down the stretch.  I give him a cheesy pistol finger point (not wanting to seem to overzealous) and he pounds chest and pumps his fist in the air.  I couldn't help and and I pumped my fist too.

I had planned on stopping after meeting him again, but I was pumped now.  I was determined to meet him on his next lap around again.  I saw him round the corner and started the sprint I always do to finish my run.  He throws his hand up and we high five mid sprint.

So between a hectic work schedule and having two young kids at home, my personal time to get out there and pound the proverbial pavement is limited to 5 in the morning. Gross I know. Below are some of the random thoughts that have popped in my head during my morning runs as I try to get back in shape.

* ""Whhhhyyyyyyy???!!!""
* I should've checked the temperature before leaving... it feels like -40c (actually -20c)
* Never trust a fart... seriously, just be in discomfort
* My nose is a frigging faucet right now and I'm running out of sleeve real estate
* I'll just snot rocket, I've seen other people do it (proceed to blow snot down my face)
* That song ""Chocolate Rain"". Not just a bit of it, but a shocking amount...
* Did I turn the coffee machine on? Maybe I should just turn back...
* Oh god, my whole body hurts 
* As my headlamp illuminates 4 pairs of glowing eyes - please be deer, please be deer....
* Even though I have confirmation they were deer, I proceed to feel followed and check behind myself every 100 feet... I pick up my pace
* Hey remember that time I could feel my toes... My feet feel like cinderblocks in the cold
* Proceed to run through my giant to-do-list for the day, really just making me feel shitty I'm not chipping away at it
* Look at my watch and see that I've been running for a lot less time, covering a heck of a lot less distance than what it feels like
* I start to remind myself of a time that I was younger and in much better shape
* I put on some music to distract me from the pain and really, just feel like a champ. 
* When the world isn't a total dumpster fire I should definitely enter a race
* After nearly hitting the deck - who the hell puts a song with sirens in the background on a workout playlist?!

I proceed to head back home; humbled, sore, irritated by this running playlist with aspirations of crushing it at a race fading quickly... But, I'll be back at it tomorrow, because I'm a runner and that's what I do.

248,1657805555.0,Running from cancer,"Several months ago, there was a thread on this forum asking how running had changed people's lives. I was a bit late to the party, but I posted the story of how running helped me through cancer, and a few people seemed to find it meaningful. Today, on the two-year anniversary of my breast cancer diagnosis, I thought I'd share it more widely. Maybe someone needs to hear it today. I would love to hear others' stories of how running has impacted your life in the comments.

I'd been a runner off and on since my twenties, but started running again consistently a few years ago in my mid-thirties, shortly before getting a life-altering diagnosis of a cancer-causing genetic mutation. My genetic mutation causes an extremely high lifetime risk of stomach cancer that generally can't be caught on screenings, as well as a roughly 50% lifetime risk of breast cancer.

The recommendation was to have my entire stomach removed to prevent cancer. It was terrifying, so I ran and ran and ran, right up until the day before my surgery. It felt like the only time I had any peace from my thoughts.

It can be hard to keep weight on with no stomach, so post-surgery, one of my major goals was to prove to my medical team that I could eat enough to fuel my running habit. I did so, and started running again just a little bit over 2 months after my surgery. At the time, I was still working through my feelings about the fact that they found stage 1 stomach cancer when they did the pathology on my stomach (as they do for most people with my genetic mutation) and runs were a great time to process that.

Then, in the summer of 2020, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. That was also terrifying, so I ran and ran and ran for my mental health. In those awful few weeks between my diagnosis and my surgery, running was the only time that I could forget that I was carrying around this little invader in my body that wanted to kill me. I think I shocked the physician's assistant when, at my two week follow-up after surgery, I was already begging for (and got!) clearance to run.

When I started chemo, I made a point of running a few miles every other day. It was far less than I was used to, but I credit running as the reason why I had a pretty easy go of it, dodging many of the side effects and never experiencing ""chemo brain.""

Prior to each chemo infusion, they would huge doses of steroids to prevent my body from rejecting the chemo drugs. The steroids made me jittery and antsy and sleepless, so it was not unusual to find me out for pre-dawn runs the day after chemo, trying to wear myself out enough to sleep. And hey! It worked. Good times.

Now, I celebrate each post-cancer milestone with long, joyful runs. I just got back from a ten miler.

I'm alive. I'm healthy. I'm cancer-free. And I'm still running.  


ETA: Thank you to you kind strangers for the awards, and to all of you for your kind words. Thank you especially to those of you sharing your stories. I'm not a hugger, but I kind of want to give all of you hugs right now.

For those of you who have asked, my specific condition is a mutation of the CDH1 gene resulting in a syndrome called hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.

&#x200B;

First, many of you rightly told me it was probably an owl. I can now confirm this because it has happened TWO MORE TIMES and I have unfortunately have had the chance to get a good look at the birds.

&#x200B;

A few facts:

1. The last two times the owls haven't made contact, but have swooped pretty much as low and close as it can without touching me but definitely scaring the shit out of me.
2. All ""swoopings"" took place in different locations. The first time was roughly 2 miles from my house. The second time was .5 miles East of my house on a dark neighborhood street. The third time was .3 miles West of my house on a well lit neighborhood main road (but not that many cars that early in the morning.)
3. All swoopings happened between 5:45-6:30 AM
4. I was wearing [this](https://imgur.com/a/eyz77Pv) for the  first two swoopings. I have since switched the hat to a dark red one, my headlamp now points straight up and I've attached a red blinking light to the back of the headlamp, so it shines on the back of my head/down my back.
5. I live in West Seattle

&#x200B;

Again, I understand this is kind of a ridiculous thing, but it is realllllly messing with my running ju ju. I love my early morning runs but I am literally having dreams involving owls. 

Why are they attacking/swooping at me?? Am I safe no where?!?!  Is there any way I can repel them?!

252,1585097494.0,I will write you a Free Running Plan for the next 8-10 weeks.,"Hi [r/running](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/) community, I'm a long time follower but have created this new account for privacy. I've confirmed my identity with mods. I will do this 100% through Reddit with no monetization.

Like many, I have been thinking of positive ways I can give back during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aside from making donations, supporting local and small businesses, thanking grocery store workers and hospital workers, I also wanted to also contribute in my own way - coaching. I have seen running start to make a comeback as people are quarantined and it gives them an opportunity to escape, de-stress, and exercise - all the while complying with social distancing recommendations. I want to assist anyone who doesn't know where to begin, wants to improve, or achieve their best - for free.

I have been involved in running and coaching for 20 years. I feel fortunate that I've had incredible mentors and coaches in my running career who have helped me grow as a runner and a person. I've gained so much from running from affordable college to traveling the country and beyond to meeting my wife. It has helped me land jobs, unwind when stress, and continue to push myself.

On that same note, I've always felt that running to your fullest potential should never be restricted because of money. It’s one of the most primal, basic forms of exercise and competition that requires little more than your legs and a destination. Nonetheless, there is often an overwhelming amount of information and barriers that can price people out of the fundamentals for optimal training. I’ve always had a passion to remove that barrier so anyone who wants to run can have easy and low cost access to the best training possible.

In the past, I have co-founded non-profit running camps that explain the basics of running and how to write your own training plans. I have also coached at the high school and collegiate level, as well as private. As a runner myself, I have ran 4:00 for the mile and 14 low for 5k. Am I the fastest runner? No. Am I the best coach out there? No. Are there people who are more knowledgable and been around running for longer? Absolutely.

However, I want to give back in some way. I have created a website \[redacted due to mods request\] that allows people to submit some basic information and I will write a free 10-Week training plan and email it to them. There is no monetization. The goal isn't to make money. Instead, it's to try and give back to the running community in another capacity. If I were to later put ads on the site, allow paid coaches to advertise, or write articles, I would donate all profits to charity - I'm thinking donations to local parks, trails, and funding tracks in areas that don't have them.

The website is barebones and terrible (it's something far from my specialty), but I wanted to get something out there. I would love **any suggestions** from this great community to make it better and more accessible to more people. I can handle any sort of feedback you have. I won't be posting the link to any sites, but any input towards such a site would be so appreciated!

Please feel free to reply here or DM me if you want me to write you a free training plan. I am lucky enough to still be working currently but will write these plans every weekend (and nights if necessary). If you know someone starting running or wanting to improve during this time, have them also reply to contact me via DM me. Similarly, If you just want to chat running or get some advice, reach out to me on this thread or DM. It can be training, coaching, recruiting, whatever.

Note: It may take until this weekend until I get your schedule, but I will reply to EVERYONE ASAP and write your plan by this weekend if possible! You rock

Second note: it will definitely take until this weekend. I’m also going to try recruit some help from some other coaches.

UPDATE: This has blown up way more than I could have imagined. I am still reading through all the responses and will try get to any questions ASAP. The plan for now is to get multiple variances of 1 Mile and 5k training plans posted by Sunday with them set to begin the following day. I will post the entire 8-week schedules in a thread Sunday night and leave the floor open for questions. I'll also have weekly follow-up threads with that weeks training in case anyone has questions, or for others to share tips or just chat about their training.

The following Sunday, I will do the same but with 8-Week training plans for people training for the 10k or Half-Marathon. Again, I will leave the floor open for questions at that time to help the training plan have a custom feel.

Please note, there are a lot of AMAZING running coaches out there. I'm not trying to undercut any of them. Just looking to provide some basic instructions for those getting into running and looking to improve. If you want truly personalized, customized training and someone dedicated to you - there are a lot of amazing coaches out there!

Route - so we started out at 4:30 am in sowerby bridge west Yorkshire , we intially planned the route so we'd finish near home but decided not to go ahead with that as I would of just wanted to give up towards the end. We stayed on the canal from sowerby bridge and ran all the way to todmorden after which we decided to run up to Burnley and from there we ran all the Leeds Liverpool canal and there was a point at which I decided to call it as I wasn't able to push anymore. 

Provisions - It wouldn't of possible at all if my mates wife didn't meet is in her car at 2/3hr intervals to actually restock on water and food. 


Pre run

I got an early night but it didn't really help that I had a fairly large training week the week before , it definitely did not help.

I brought my Salomon pack with a 1.5 litre hydration bladder , electrolyte tablets , alot of food , my GoPro for vlogging.

During the run 

So it really got tough after I got to the 50k marker with my friend as the last time before that , that I actually ran 50k was 18 months ago in a 50k race called the white rose ultra. I was so ready to give up and I even got delirious 70 miles in and started to verge on having double vision. What really didn't help was the mid day heat when we were running between Burnley and leeds. Intially in the run we were keeping up with the pace and taking walking breaks and keeping up with the pace , then it felt like it was falling apart 70 miles in but then I've only done one marathon distance training run this year and haven't run a 50k distance in  ages !

257,1638647019.0,For fat & slow runners: broke my 5k PR after 8 years!,"tl;dr - Took me 8 years of on-again, off-again running, but I finally broke a stubborn 5k PR that I never thought possible, through weight loss and incorporating strength training and speedwork.

Disclaimer:  I am overweight and a very slow runner.  Most of you on this sub are probably more than twice as fast as I am.  So what I'm going to share is probably silly/meaningless to most, but I'm sharing because this was such a long time coming... and maybe will help some other slow and/or fat runners.

I've always been fat, and about 8 years ago, I started running to lose weight.  I was always really slow, typically running \~41-45 min 5k times.  My 5k PR was 38:02 but I never really considered it a true PR because the course had to have been less than 5k (only 3.05 miles on my watch, even though my watch \*always\* tallies a tad higher than the official race distance).

But I focused on running distance more than speed, so I worked my way up to ""running"" a couple of half marathons, obv very slow.  I got plantar fasciitis.  And I had plateaued on the weight loss because I was eating more to compensate the longer distances run.  So I sort of gave up on running regularly.  I became a very non-serious exerciser, doing a 2-3 mile run/walk once a month at best.

About 4 years ago, I had moved to a new state for a new job, and things were more conducive to picking up running again (weather, flatter, sidewalks in my neighborhood, etc.).  But of course, I was still fat (had gained back much of the weight lost 4 years prior).  I slowly worked my way back up to being able to complete a half marathon, but still wasn't doing things right (no weight training, eating more calories than I was running off).  I did a few 5k's and got close to my PR, as close as 38:32.  But I never felt that my body could do better, that I would never break the PR.  I figured I was just fat and simply not a runner.

Well, then life happened, I had to get serious about making tenure (I'm a college professor), then the pandemic, etc.  I gained all the weight back and more.

Early this year, I decided to switch to a vegetarian diet.  Picked up running again this past summer.  I decided to do things differently this time.  First, instead of trying to increase distance too quickly, I would keep my runs in the 2-4 mile range so that I wouldn't feel like I had to eat everything in sight afterwards.  This has helped me lose 30 lbs so far.  Second, I have incorporated weight training and core exercises.  Third, I began doing ""speedwork"" (well, as ""speedy"" as I can get!) through interval/fartlek type runs and doing a massive hill near my house.  But even then, my best mile time on a training run was 11:30, and I was \*gassed\* after that.  My usual 5k training runs have been in the 40-42 minute range.  The 5k PR still seemed so far out of reach.

Well I signed up for a 5k this morning.  It was my first 5k in literally 4 years.  I was nervous about even finishing.  It was a bit congested at the start, especially since I started at the back of the pack and ended up having to dodge around walkers throughout the first mile.  But when I saw the 1 mile sign, my watch was at 12:09.  I was in shocked, and from there I wanted to at least attempt to come close to that damn PR.  Thankfully there was a water station at 1.5 miles, because I needed to walk by that point.  The short walk was refreshing, and I started running again.  But around 2.25 miles, my legs were dragging and there was a \~0.1 mile uphill.  I had to walk, and sort of gave up on coming close to the PR at that point.  But I forced myself to run after cresting that hill and just not stop running - kept telling myself I had only 0.7 mile, then 0.5 mile, then 0.25 mile left to go.  Sprinted (for me) the last 0.1 mile once the finish line was in sight.

Official chip time 37:02.  A PR by a minute!  A PR I honestly never thought possible.  I literally happy cried in my car when I saw the official race time on my phone.  I also had negative splits the entire course - something else I never thought I would be able to do!

Anyway, thanks for listening/reading.  I know this time is super slow for most of you, but the small victory has made me feel so good today.

258,1614686002.0,Stopped drinking alcohol 2 months ago. Here's the impact it's had on my running,"I'll start by saying I was drinking much more than average- like, go-get-help amounts. But I quit a few months ago for good and the past 2 months are the longest I’ve gone without a drink in 15 years. 

My energy level has been off the charts. I weighed ~190 throughout 2020 and am at ~172 now (drinking water only and switched to vegetable heavy diet). I’ve just been watching my avg pace trickle down and down. Here’s my results the past few weeks. This is in addition to lots of indoor treadmill and cycling activities (which got me through the 10 day gap in mid Feb, when I couldn’t go outside because of the ice storm).

They say it’s easy to replace one addiction with another, so running has been it for me. I’m not new to it- I was a consistent sub 7 minute mile 5k runner through high school and college, but that got diminished heavily the last couple years mostly b/c of drinking.

With all of the increase in new activity (never ran before), I focused a lot of stretching in my down time. Hip flexors, quads, hams, glutes, calves, lower back. I did my absolute best to listen to my body. 

Unfortunately, I did still come up with a nagging pain in the inside of my knee (right side of my left knee). My last run was Oct 25. It was pretty uncomfortable. On Oct 27 I did a 3.5 mile power hike which didn't hurt my knee, but running of any kind was very painful. I haven't done anything at all since then. I ice it every day. I even took the next few days of from stretching. 

I'm trying to convince myself that it's okay to rest it and recover, but I feel like I'm losing all momentum. Literally, I can feel the anxiety build up if I think about not being able to get back into things mentally. I was making good progress on a horrible aerobic base, my form was improving, cadence was steady and predictable, and my confidence and motivation to run was at an all time high.

269,1589665976.0,"Everyone is sharing how excited they are that the coronavirus can't stop them from running, but it stopped me and I am beyond heartbroken.","I want to start out by saying I absolutely love this subreddit. I came upon this sub when I was looking to lose some extra weight for my wedding in October. I found C25K here, I found out that my shin splints were caused by poor running form and cheap shoes, and I discovered my love of outdoor running. I never once thought I could be a runner. I would look at runners and think things like ""That could never be me"" or ""How can anyone enjoy this exercise?""

But after a few months of outdoor running and some guidance, I loved it. I was running for 9 months straight before I contracted COVID-19. Prior to getting sick, I lost 15 pounds. I alleviated a lot of my generalized anxiety disorder symptoms by running. I lowered my blood pressure and resting heart rate. I slept great. I felt great. Every week, I reached a new milestone and new PR. I distinctly remember the feeling of running my fastest 5k (not nearly as fast as anyone on this sub, but fast for me!), my first 10k, my fastest 10k, my fastest mile (still only around 9 minutes, but I was so proud of myself), my first 8 mile run, and finally gaining up to 20 miles per week.

Post covid, I have gained 10 pounds, I sleep like shit, and I feel like I could jump out of my skin. I can no longer do the thing that I fell in love with.

I am a critical care nurse, and in early April, I contracted covid, and since then I have a myriad of unfortunate symptoms and a lingering case that has left me testing positive well into 3 weeks of the virus. I had fevers that lingered for an entire month. I attempted to go back to work, and symptoms relapsed. I tried running just a 1/2 mile light jog, and I was so sore, it took me four days to recover. 

Two of my first races were canceled - the Donor Dash and the Broad Street Run in Philadelphia. I want to share in everyone's accomplishments here, but I also am completely heartbroken to know that I found an exercise I truly loved, that I no longer can do as of now. Has anyone had any similar stories, maybe where they had injuries and they came back even stronger than before? I am feeling devastated at all the progress I am losing by being sedentary. I am starting to walk again, but I am too afraid to run at this point. I got diagnosed with post-viral inflammatory syndrome and it could be months until my body is fully healed, and sadly, any intense form of exercise seems to exacerbate my illness. 

Looking for some uplifting stories and hope to pull me through this difficult time. Thanks, runners!

270,1615666500.0,I love supportive people.,"I went for a run today and was in a bad mood by the time I got to the trail. The zipper on my jacket wasn’t working, it was windy, and the trail, which I haven’t been to since the fall, was sill super muddy and icy in some parts. At one point I was walking on a particularly icy bit and I passed an older couple that were sitting on a bench. 
The guy gestured to the path and said “what a great day for a walk.” And I said I wanted to run, but apparently that wasn’t going to happen. He laughed and said I should’ve brought snow shoes.
After a while I got into the hang of jogging over the dry bits and stopping to walk over the icy ones and I was beginning to feel a little bit better. On the way back I passed the same couple on a different bench while I was running over a dry stretch. I couldn’t hear them very well because I had headphones in, but the man started making a rooting gesture to me. I made it back and then the wife started waving her arms around shouting “yeah!” and I gave them a thumbs up while I ran past and it was awesome. 
I loved the support and it put me in such a better headspace.

271,1633193291.0,"TIFU bad. I bonked on a 15 mile run and ended up 4 miles from home with no food, water, mask, toilet, and no way to get back.","So I'm a casual runner (some may even say jogger) but am in the middle of a marathon training program.  I'm at the 15 mile part of the training program.  In the last few weeks, I had completed the 12 and 14 mile runs easily, so I was feeling a bit cocky.  The important context for this story is that I usually run at night after the sun is down and when I have a full belly of food, but I tried running for the first time for the 10 mile ""cool down"" run in the early morning and really enjoyed it.  It was nice to be out when the sun was rising but the air was still cool and the world is still quiet. Also, I didn't eat or drink anything before this run, and I felt great and light as a feather.

So, the next week I decide to run the 15 mile run at 6:30am the morning. I decide to do what worked last time and to not eat or drink anything before the run, but I do have a gel pack I was planning on eating mid-run.  I also for some inexplicable reason decide to try a new route.  I know you're thinking at this point: ""this guy is really stupid,"" and you are correct.

So I bonk hard at mile 11 from some combination of dehydration, lack of food, and not being used to running in the sun. Around that point, I'm on a new route and I'm also not thinking very straight, so I take a wrong turn. I'm really struggling but still going at maybe a slow 11min/mile pace until, at mile 14, I recognize a landmark I had passed near the halfway point.  I had circled back at some point in my delirious state and began running away from home. And at this point I'm completely exhausted and had pretty much 0 left in the tank even a couple of miles ago. I shuffle walk the last mile and stop my tracker at mile 15. 

But now I'm 4 miles away from home, and it's about 9:30am and getting pretty hot.  I live in a Southwestern state, so it goes from cool to boiling hot quickly.  I'm completely dehydrated, I am exhausted, have no food, no way to get home, and now, to make matters worse, I've hit the time in the morning when I usually poop, so now I have to do that.  I'm in the city so there are stores and gas stations around, but I didn't bring a mask!  So I'm unable to go into a store and unable to take a rideshare home.  They probably would have made an exception for me, but honestly I was in such a horrible state, looking like a zombie and dripping sweat, that I was too embarrassed to even try.

So what do I do?  I crap in a bush somewhere, but don't have toilet paper, so my butt is all itchy.  And then I slowly walk home over 2 hours in 90+ degree heat without any food or water.  Also, I was out way longer than expected, so the sun was getting high in the sky and there was no longer any shade.  I had at least put a bit of sunscreen on before I left, but it had long stopped working and I was starting to burn.  It was one of the worst experiences of my life.  And I more or less collapse when I get home.  Of course I drink a lot of Gatorade and eat a lot of carbs, but it took an entire day to recover to where I'm at least partly feeling normal.

So if you're a new runner, please learn from this story and don't repeat my mistakes!  Don't get cocky and always be prepared!

TLDR: Went on a 15 mile run without food, water, or a mask. Got lost. Bonked hard. Crapped in a bush. Walked 4 miles home in the heat and probably had dehydration and heat stroke.",running

280,1619621916.0,Ran Every Day For 1 Year,"When covid lockdowns first hit last year I was already overweight and out of shape then I just sat around eating all day long. I was eating a ton and easily hit 4,000-5,000 calories a day with essentially zero exercise on top of all that eating. 

I decided to start running but knew I wouldn’t keep up with it on my own so I reached out to two friends and asked if they wanted to support each other in running. I proposed that we all commit to running X amount of days per week and send a screenshot of our run afterwards each day. We could encourage each other and hold each other accountable if we didn’t run when we said we would. They both loved the idea. Friend 1 said he would run 4 days a week which is what I was thinking I’d do. Friend 2 who tends to be over the top excitedly proclaimed that he would run a 5K every day. I’m pretty competitive so I said I would also run a 5K every day. 

At that time I was not a distance runner and never had been. I played sports but never ran distance. Add in the fact that I was 70lbs heavier than I was in my days of playing sports and it was awful running a 5K. Hell, 1 mile was hard let alone 3.1 miles! 

The first month I was doing about 11:30 mins/mile and it was awful and initially it didn’t get better. By month 2 though it slowly started to get just a little easier. Some weight started coming off and since I weighed less my back and knees started feeling a little better. 

I didn’t keep up with the 5K every day but I did run every day. I ended up with a few different loops from my house that started and ended in my driveway. One was 2.7 miles, one was 4.5 miles, and the other 6.5 miles. I got into a good routine of doing the 2.7 mile loop two days in a row then the 4.5 then two days of the 2.7 then the 6.5 and repeat. 

As I got better at running my time started getting better and one day I set off to be under 8:45 mins/mile. It was extremely difficult but I did it! Then the weight really started coming off and in 4 months I was down 50 lbs.! 

As I kept running my pace kept getting better. Now a typical short run (2.7 miles) is around 7:30 miles/minute and a longer run (5+ miles) is a little over 8:00 mins/mile. 

My longest run ended up being a half-marathon one morning when I was off of work. 

My totals for the year ended up being 1,082.38 miles ran (or 2.9 miles per day - not quite a 5K a day) and 51 pounds lost. I ran everyday no matter what. Pouring rain? Snow? Sleet? Hail? 95 degrees and sunny? I ran in it all. 

The biggest thing for me - and why I’m posting about it - was having others to hold me accountable and encourage me. The 3 of us supported each other the whole time and it made a huge difference. Friend 1 who originally committed to 4 days a week ended up doing 6 days most weeks and dropped from 340 lbs to 280 lbs! Friend 2 had a baby and that put a damper on his running but he still ran most days and dropped from 220 lbs to 205 lbs. 

A few final thoughts. There was definitely some luck involved. I didn’t get sick or injured for the past year which allowed me to run every day. Also, running everyday probably isn’t the best idea as the chance of an overuse injury is probably pretty high but for me the mental aspect of “I am doing this everyday no matter what!” was more important for me personally.",running
281,1594486467.0,WTF is wrong with runners?,"Last year I ran a half marathon and after training for that I thought “ok that was fun. I don’t really think I need to ever run farther than that”

Well in the last week and a half I ran a half marathon distance on dirt road in some shoes that 13 miles was really the top end of comfort. Went home ordered some Hoka speedgoats and talked myself into doing a 50k in 2021 (assuming we have races in 2021). 

So yeah that escalated quickly. What is wrong with runners why do we go from I could use a more comfortable long distance shoe to I’m gonna run a 50k?",running

283,1609612924.0,Things I’ve learned while completing 1000 miles in 2020,"So it wasn’t the plan, but I completed 1000 miles in 2020. Christmas day I woke up and was bored so I calculated how many miles I had done this year. I was 47 short of 1000. Typically I do between 18-24 miles a week, so with the motivation of loved ones I buckled down and did the 47 in six days getting me right to 1000 miles on NYE.

Things I’ve learned this year:

1. There is no shame in slowing down. 

I don’t think I could have maintained my long runs of 8-10 miles over the summer had I not drastically slowed down. Yes it felt embarrassing at first doing sometimes slower than a 12 minute mile when I typically did 9-10 mins/mile, but the results were awesome. I didn’t dread running, and I was always able to complete my run. Also, as I’m sure you already know, you do get faster once the temp starts to cool down.

2. Summer running is HOT, but heat tolerance is definitely a thing. 

I live in Houston, TX. I was running in upper 90 degrees frequently over the summer without any issues. I learned that timing my runs to where I’d finish around when the sun was setting was the best time.  Never did I ever think I’d get to the point where running 8 miles in 98 degrees would be easy peasy. Again, slowing down plays a huge role in why all this was possible.

3. Nature is fucking beautiful. 

I’ve lived in Houston for 8 years. It wasn’t until this last year that I learned how breathtaking our sunsets are. This is partly why I was always so adamant on finishing my runs as the sun was setting. It is the perfect way to finish off the day. My last mile would always face the sunset. I was always able to watch the sky turn vibrant colors of red, pink and orange. Sometimes even purple. I didn’t know it did that here. Also the park I run at has pretty trees and shit too so that’s dope. 

4. Running is my best antianxiety, antidepressant, stress reliever. 

I’d read about how good running was for our mental health, but never believed it. I’ve been running for years, basically since cross country in middle school. I’m 26 now. I think before this year I was always in the mindset that you had to run faster, so my runs were always exhausting. After I finally completed my first marathon in January, I took a step back to reevaluate my goals. I read that Fitzgerald 80/20 book and that’s when I decided to slow it down. 
I started running based off my heart rate and kept it at low intensity. Running slowly became much easier and much more enjoyable. I don’t know when it changed,  but I do remember one day feeling super stressed and anxious with work and thinking “I need to go on a run to clear my mind.” 
I have such a fondness towards my runs, as well as the park I run at. It’s like my second home. 

Anyway, sorry for the long post. Just needed to share my thoughts and reflection on my running journey from this last year. If you have anything to add to this, please do. I love hearing about other people’s experiences and input.

TLDR: After running 1000 miles in 2020, I’ve learned that slowing down is key, summer is hot, nature is lit, and the positive mood effects are real :)",running

&nbsp;

For 2 years I'd spent everyday working in a corporate office job in Canterbury. Each lunch time I'd walk around the city and pass the Cathedral.

&nbsp;

One day after a rough breakup and some time to re-evaluate my life I posted late night on Reddit a crazy idea. I would quit my job and run to Sicily. I didn't expect much from it but when I woke up I was inundated with support and kindness. This sub gave me the confidence to leap into the unknown and take on this epic adventure.


&nbsp;

Flash forward a few months and I've gone from jogging 5km on a treadmill to running an ultra marathon and now ticking off 1500km on my way to Palermo. I ran across France and dealt with angry dogs, ancient Roman roads and long stretches with no food or water. The weather was cold at first and I had sleep in all my clothing and wrap myself up like a burrito in my sleeping bag.

&nbsp;

I crossed the Jura mountains in Switzerland and to lake Geneva, where I met with a kind stranger and fellow redditor John. John had gotten in touch with me after my first post, and he let me stay in his beautiful home, with his beautiful family and he fed me, restocked my bag and even gave me some supplements and kit. I passed the Alps, through 15-20ft of snow wearing swim shorts and trail shoes. I climbed down over avalanche trails and used sharp rocks as make shift ice picks. I ran down the Aosta valley into northern Italy. I had a short break in Turin to see some Italian family. I got a virus and stopped to rest up with some friends in Milan. Then feeling better I ran through the rice fields and industrial landscape of northern Italy. I hit Fidenza and looped back through the mountains towards the Mediterranean. As I write this I'm just a few kilometres from Massa 

&nbsp;

I've had people invite me into their homes, feed me, give me water, let me charge my devices. I've also had people spit at me, tell me to leave town, and try to run me off the road with their cars. I never know what will happen each day.

&nbsp;

I've wild camped in forests, in cities hidden behind bushes, in homes, monasteries, hotels, hostels, farms, mountainsides and I even got given the keys to a Castle for the night. I've drank water that made me trip out and vomit and almost pass out on a mountain. I've been chased by bulls and packs of dogs. I've met other adventurous souls, and even got given a replacement backpack after my original cut into my shoulders.

&nbsp;

So far I've managed to raise almost £5000 for Youth Cancer Charity that do incredible work to help 14-30 year olds suffering from varying stages of cancer. That will pay for 10 people to visit the YCT house and get the support and help they need to face Cancer head on. They get to meet others in their situation and build a support network of people that understand what they're facing. 

&nbsp;

I've just reached the Mediterranean sea, and I'm currently taking a day to rest up before heading down through Tuscany to Rome. Really struggling with the language, but I'm getting by and getting used to solo life on the road. It's been the most amazing experience so far and if anyone ever wants to embark on something similar please don't hesitate to ask me for advice.

### Background
You might have heard of various marathons in Antarctica, where for tens of thousands of dollars you can fly to somewhere near the coast and tick off the last continent. This isn't one of those.

This was the South Pole Marathon, organized by those of us who are working at the National Science Foundation's Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. There's no entry fee and the only way to join is to be one of the roughly 150 people working here during the austral summer when the race happens. The course isn't approved by any organizing body and everyone who helps out is just volunteering on their one day off per week.


### Training
It's really hard to run at the south pole. The station sits on the polar plateau at an elevation of 9300'/2860m, but because the atmosphere is thinner this far from the equator, the pressure altitude most days is normally 10500-11000'/3200-3350m.

Also, it's always cold. For my first run at the beginning of November it was -50 F/-45 C air temperature with a windchill of -80 F/-62 C. Thankfully we're now in the middle of summer and it's not quite so cold anymore, but it's still far below freezing. Lastly, there's nothing but snow here. I mostly run on vehicle paths where the snow is tamped down, but even then it's much more difficult than running on pavement or dirt.

With all that in mind, I was mostly running 20-25 miles a week here, and my biggest training week was two weeks ago with 30 miles (49 km). Not a ton for marathon training, but hey, you try it. I also did laps up the ""beer can"" which is the tallest staircase on station. It's 92 steps from the bottom to the top and since I arrived here 11 weeks ago I've done 435 laps.

### Pre-race
I woke up around 8 AM to see a fantastic weather forecast, at least by south pole standards. It was -22 F/-30 C with a windchill of -38 F/-39 C, and a pressure altitude of only 10,300'/3150 m, so a bit more oxygen than I'm used to. It was also nice and sunny, although the forecast called for clouds later.


### Race
There was a pre-race safety brief at 9 AM, followed by the 5k/10k start at 9:45. The half/full marathon start was at 10 AM, or actually a little later since one of the runners was a bit late. It's easy to wait for someone when only seven people are running (5 marathoners, one half marathoner, and one guy who did the rarely attempted 3/4 marathon).

The course was a 6.55 mile/10.5 km loop that started at the front door of the station, and then went down the road next to the skiway (that's a runway for skiplanes) for about 2.5 miles/4 km before turning around and coming back towards the start. Then we went around the ceremonial south pole (the mirrored sphere with flags behind it), out to the atmospheric research observatory, around the true south pole, up the stairs into the backdoor of the station, down the main station hallway, and back to the start. (Look at the first photo in the photos section if that doesn't make sense.) Coming inside every lap allowed for an aid station with food that didn't freeze solid and let people come and cheer without having to put on all their cold weather gear to go outside.

The first lap was spent trailing the guy who beat me in the Christmas Day 3k fun run. I knew he was faster than me but I also knew I had better endurance, so my plan was just to stay close and let him slow down later in the race. The sun was out for the first lap and it was even warm enough for me to take my mittens off for a bit. Coming down the skiway road there were lots of high fives from the 10k runners and it was generally just a joyous atmosphere. As awful as it can be, running in Antarctica is a special thing. Right around the turnaround we even had the good fortune to have a flyover from a plane bringing some tourists to the private tourist camp nearby, so that was pretty cool. The skiway is a bit monotonous but a decent surface, but getting back to the station and going around the poles is a lot more exciting and mentally easier than a flat road to nowhere. Technically the skiway road does turn into the South Pole Traverse road which runs all the way to McMurdo Station on the coast, but it looks like a road to nowhere.

I barely stopped at the aid station after the first lap since I was feeling pretty good and immediately went out for lap two. Around 10 miles/16 km I caught up with the lead runner and we ran together for 20 or 30 minutes until I pulled ahead. Coming through the station at the halfway point in the lead I drank some water, restocked my stash of pocket oreos, and had a brief chat with the station's doctor to assure him that I was ok. Then onto lap three, which I knew would be the hardest.

By this point the 10k walkers were done, the sun was gone, and it was just running all alone in freezing fog. Other than the occasional snowmobile of someone patrolling the course to make sure we were ok, there wasn't much to see. Mentally, this was the worst part for me. At the turnaround on the skiway I got to pass the other runners going in the opposite direction and I realized I was over a mile ahead of the next runner, so I knew as long as I didn't hurt myself or radically slow down the race was mine.

As I started lap four I knew I was slowing down, but I was determined to not walk, partly because I would get cold, but mostly because I knew I was really close to a five hour pace. The miles down the skiway seemed to drag on forever and the fog made the station impossible to see, but as I came past the front door I knew I just had to do the bit by the poles and I was done, so I dug deep and sped up since I was so close to five hours.

Coming through the station with lots of people lining the hallway was an incredible feeling. I felt a lot better than I look in the pictures. There was a banner to run through at the end which I was not expecting, and then straight back out the door because my GPS said I was at 25.9 miles and I wasn't going to stop there, so I did an extra 0.3 miles/0.5 km to round it out. GPS units get very confused when you go around the south pole. Mine had the course as a bit short distance but other people's had it over 2 miles long, so we really don't know. With the extra 0.3 miles my GPS time was 5:01:35, but my official (according to the guy with the stopwatch; it's not like we have race timers here) time was 4:57:56.

### Post-race

I waited around at the finish for the next two marathoners and the one person who did three laps, then spent nearly an hour in the sauna. The sauna is partly about warmth, but mostly it's just for the humidity. The polar plateau is the driest desert on the planet and the humidity inside the station is in the single digits, so the sauna and the greenhouse are the only places on station to let your lungs rehydrate and heal after so much time breathing cold air. Then dinner in the galley and then a good night's sleep under the midnight sun.

292,1599526654.0,Running has helped me heal from my miscarriage,"I posted here about a month ago that I was pregnant with my 2nd child, asking for running tips during 1st trimester.  I learned 5 days ago that the pregnancy might not be viable and then spent the past few days naturally miscarrying.  I was able to mentally reconcile the fact that if it wasn't viable, my body was doing what it was supposed to, but it was still incredibly sad and difficult to go through.  

Today I was laying around trying to feel better and decided to go for a run. I ran further and longer than I usually do and it felt amazing. I spent the past week feeling utterly powerless and weak and that run helped me remember just how powerful and capable I am.  I also got a cool achievement notification that I've been running for 6 months straight, which is out of the ordinary for me.

Thank goodness for running and supportive online communities.

Edit: Just wanted to say thank you for all of the support and responses.  Miscarriage can be incredibly lonely - it was too early to tell very many people we were expecting and I've had to continue working and living through this. I wasn't expecting so many responses from people in the running community who have also been through this heartache.  And I found the responses from men who have been through it particularly eye opening.  Thank you again for the support.  Wishing you all love, happiness, and stellar runs.",running

December of last month was at a very low point (depression, drinking, smoking up to 2 packs of cigarettes a day) and just felt gross. I didn’t want to get in to any old activities or be very social so I thought I’d try some running just to clear my head. January 4th I made it .67 miles. I immediately had this feeling of “what have I done to myself”. Instead of inspiring me to keep going I just got more frustrated with my situation.

I quit smoking and tried again a week later and said no matter what, I’d get a mile in and I did. The mental health benefits were outrageous so on and off I’d do my best to run a mile or two when I could. Come February I was able to hit about 4-5 miles semi consistently and today, hit 7.11 miles.

My first mile today was 8:03, but sadly my average was 10:01 (really wanted that sub 10 minute average and was a little annoyed but there’s always tomorrow). But that 8:03 is my best time yet so that got me a little excited. 

If anyone is having a hard time starting out, just keep going. The benefits outweigh any pain you feel in the beginning and keep going, especially when you don’t want to.

298,1540010714.0,We broke a Guinness World Record for running 1000km on a treadmill!!!,"For those who missed the previous posts: 

Myself and 11 other doctors are running a combined Million Metres (1000km) as a relay on a treadmill. The current world record is 82 hours (4m55s min/km =  7m55s min/mile). 12 runners total, divided into 2 teams of 6, each team running for 6 hours at a time while the other team rests. In that 6 hour block, each of us run between 15 and 25min (depending on runner ability and injury), totalling 3 runs each per 6hr block.

&#x200B;

WE DID IT!!!

We broke the world record!!!

We finished in 71hrs 44min 57sec for 1000km!! More than 11hours under the previous world record (set in 2002!)

&#x200B;

HOW IT WENT DOWN - Once we had finished 6 sessions of 6hrs for each team, we were close to finishing (968km). We realised that we could potentially break the record in under 3 days (72hrs)... We knew this would require a significant increase in pace. We were all sore and tired but it was 9am Friday morning in the foyer of a large tertiary centre hospital. We had a large crowd gathered to inspire and motivate us along so we decided to go for it and try get the record in under 72hrs. We finished running the last 32km in 5min intervals, with each runner rotating through. The guy who started the charity finished off the last run!

&#x200B;

Far out, a huge mix of emotions as we finished! 9 months of training and hard work all paying off. We raised over $300,000 to go towards setting up a Melanoma Unit at the hospital we work at!!! When we started, we picked $250,000 as our target. It seemed huge and unachievable but we got there! Before we started running, we had raised approx $175,000, and even then, the thought of getting to $250,000 seemed unrealistic....  It was amazing to see the generosity of the general public as they walked passed and saw what we were doing and wanted to contribute! 

&#x200B;

I am now certainly giving me legs a well earned break!

Pace breakdown:

* overall pace - 4m18s - (6m55s min/mile)

301,1590640436.0,Just completed my first non-stop 5k. Told myself I'd buy new shoes at this milestone.,"First off, it feels great to be able to run 5k! I decided to start running a few weeks ago and my first run I barely made 1.8k. Today I did my first 5k in 27:38!

When I first picked up running I decided I'd go with an old pair of Walmart shoes I use all the time, and if I stuck with the hobby til I could do 5k then I'd get myself a modest pair of runners. That said, I know pretty much nothing about running shoes so I'm looking for suggestions. I'm hoping to stay under $50 CAD (if you think that price is unrealistic, please tell me). I'm an 18 yo male, 135lbs, if that makes a difference.

Thanks for any help, and happy running!

Edit: looks like I did indeed underestimate the price of good shoes. I'll be adjusting my budget and looking out for the kinds y'all have suggested perhaps on sale. Thanks for the advice and suggestions!",running
302,1627563498.0,From a Hijabi runner: Thank you all!,"Hi all,

I posted this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/opa73x/running\_with\_hijab/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/opa73x/running_with_hijab/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) a while ago - about wanting to run again but struggling with keeping my hair covered.

Very interesting thread, and SO many good suggestions by very helpful folks: men, women, Muslim and non-Muslim. Even after the thread was locked, so many of you messaged me with suggestions. I just really appreciate it.

Everybody contributing really pushed me to finally go out and run again, yesterday, for the first time in probably 2 years if not more. It reminded me how much I actually enjoy it, how freeing it is, and made me feel proud that I didn't let the bad weather or anything else get in my way.

I think that I didn't need anything ground-breaking in terms of a solution, but just all those suggestions showed me that I was making up excuses for myself when the answer was so simple.

Anyway - I just want to say thank you all.

303,1595534142.0,"First run after covid, 46.","My 10 days was up yesterday, so I was eager to see how bad I was.  I had it pretty bad, with flu like symptoms the entire time.  O2 dropped to 90 with normal breathing due to blood cell damage from covid. Breathing exercises will raise it temporarily, but your blood just won't absorb as much. Lungs wore sore, but never got blocked, thankfully.

The run/walk was tough.  1.2 miles in 27 minutes.  It was extremely hot out, and I didn't push.  For the next 4-6 months while damaged blood cells are being replaced, I know my body will adapt to be more efficient with less O2.  Just a high altitude training mask you can't take off.

It all began with a rough breakup, a mind numbing job and a simple late night Reddit post.

&nbsp;

You guys gave me the inspiration I needed to start this crazy journey. Your comments, support and help. I've learnt what kit I need, how to use it correctly, I've even had offers to stay with fellow redditors, one of which I'm getting close to now on Lake Geneva (need to message you John :s).

&nbsp;

Ever since it's been a whirlwind. I've been featured in newspapers, podcasts, radio and more. All of that was pretty nerve wracking at first, but now I'm getting used to it.

I've had help from across the globe getting the ball rolling and we've already raised almost £4,000 (maybe like $18,000 dollars....right?) for a fantastic youth cancer charity that helps teenagers and young adults who are isolated and need support with the disease. Thank you so much to everyone who's donated so far.

&nbsp;

On my journey so far I've met other adventurers who are crossing the globe for a multitude of reasons. I've couchsurfed and made amazing friends. I've wild camped in some of the most beautiful spots and some of the sketchiest. I've had times when I was the happiest I've ever been, and times when I felt like I wanted to throw the towel in and fly home. I've had injuries, I've gotten lost, I've ended up running illegally on the motorway and almost being hit by a truck. I've experienced great kindness, some unexpected aggression. I've struggled with language, and learnt to mime conversations when I don't know what to say. I've been introduced to a world of adventurers and a whole sub culture I didn't know existed.

Thank you r/running. I came to you asking for help, and you did exactly what I asked. I will never forget it all started here.

315,1596641967.0,"Running in the summer finally helped me understand what an ""easy, conversational"" pace is","I had an epiphany over the last few months and just wanted to share it a little.

I've been an off/on runner for a few years, often going months without lacing up when life gets in the way. In general I prefer fall/winter running and usually stop training when temperatures rise above 70 deg F. Obviously this summer is very different for a lot of reasons, and I decided to put some effort into creating a running routine. I'm not necessarily training for anything, I just want to make running a habit and increase my fitness a little bit.

Since my housemates and I are all working from home, I had the opportunity to go on a run with my roommate who is an ultra marathoner. I told her I wanted a nice slow pace, so she set it at a ""conversational"" pace of 12 min/mile for a 4 mile run. Usually I am pushing myself to run 10:30 min/miles, and I feel totally dead by the end, HR regularly topping 200. I didnt think it was possible to hold a conversation on a run, since I had the bad idea that 10:30 was too slow. On this *actual* slow run I saw the light! 

I was used to pushing hard and still feeling bad about myself because that was ""slow"". Running with my roommate and in the heat made me slow down a lot, and I finally was able to run more than 3 miles without feeling like my heart was going to jump out of my chest. 

Finding out what an easy pace *actually* feels like has made me excited for training again. I feel like I can tackle anything now, as long as I go nice and slow!

So maybe this is a warning for any other beginners in this sub. An ""easy, conversational"" pace is *actually* a pace where you can form whole sentences. If you have to take walk breaks, especially in the summer, then so be it. It is so much more sustainable for me",running
316,1616760993.0,I really hope to see more no-swag races in the future.,"I was just thinking about more races coming back post-covid and remembering my frustration with the amount of garbage generated by races. Cups is the obvious problem but that's being addressed and many races that happened in the last year went no cup because of COVID. But less people are talking about all the other junk. I don't need any more T shirts, hats, grocery bags, pint glasses, or medals. Plus all of the coupons, flyers, bibs, wristbands, and samples wrappers that go directly into the garbage. 

If any race directors are reading this, please consider adding a no-swag option to your race registrations.

Edit: I want to emphasize 2 things:

1. I'm more targeting race bibs (there's no reason we can have a reusable RFID wristband with a unique ID that gets registered with signup) plastic bags full of coupons and junk, and cheap trinkets. I understand shirts and medals are important to many people, myself included.

318,1587853542.0,Took me 4 years to achieve a sub 20 5k.,"When I was 15, I ran a 18:31 in the 5k and then promptly moved schools and never did cross every again. I did track and joined the Army, but never really ran a competitive 5k ever again. 

When I left the service back in 2006, I stopped running because I didn't find joy in it anymore. Runs were slow and in cadence with everyone. There was no fast days, slow days, or run at your own pace days. No such thing. Only run at the same pace as everyone 3 times a week. It gets tiring and makes running suck.

So after a split from a relationship back in 2014, I decided to take up running again. I wasn't fast, but I also wasn't slow. I could do 30 minutes of cardio on the treadmill and then run a 28-29 minute 5k. I didn't mind; I wasn't trying to be competitive. Just trying to get back into running.

So when I meet my new girlfriend, I discovered this local race for veterans... so of course I was all in. I didn't have time to prepare for it, and just ran it. I managed to get a time of 28:54 with no running. It was god awful because I was literally running at-pace with anyone that caught up to me, then I would die after 200-300 meters, walk, and then catch my breath and start running at-pace with the next person to catch me. Kept it up all the way to the end. I was about 100 meters from the end when an old 70 year old man caught me. I sprinted the end and beat him by 9 seconds. 

The fastest runner ran a time of 18:00 which was 10 minutes faster then me. So I made the bold claim that with proper training I could have easily taken first and beat him. Too easy! 

The following year, I completely forgot about the race so I didn't really have any time to prep. I had like maybe 2 weeks, so I took some easy mile runs for a week, and then decided I needed 7 days of rest prior to the race. At this point in my life, I was just over 200 lbs. So I joked around with everyone that I was going to be the fastest 200 lb runner out there today. 

Just like the year prior, I ran out of steam at about 1k and just did my usual run with the person that catches me and hold it until I can't anymore, stop, breath, walk, and then start again. This was by far the worst race of my life and just as I was approaching the end of this race that same 70 year old man was catching up to me. I stayed with him as long as I could and then when I hit the last corner, I sprinted to the end. Beat him by 11 seconds for a finishing time of 31:05. 

As someone who used to love running and has been under 20 minutes for a 5k, this was just insulting. I was passed by 8 year olds, women and men with strollers or running with dogs, and almost by a 70 year old man. And to rub insult to injury, I was definitely not the fastest 200 lb runner out there that day. 

I decided enough was enough, and I was going to start getting back in shape and actually train for a run. That was back in 2017. Since then I have dropped 40 lbs, and hit an amazing time of 20:54. As for this particular race, I have never been able to get a great time. I skipped 2018's race because I just wasn't ready. It's hard to start running in mid January for a race that is in April. Then in 2019, I managed to get a time of 23:13 and place 5th in the race. 

This year, I did everything right. I starting losing weight again in December (starting at 185). I started running beginning of January and stuck with it. By beginning of March I was at 160, and I was running amazing tempo times. My St. Patrick's Day 10K race was cancelled, but I decided to run it anyway. I hit a PR in the 10k of 42:09, and 5k of 20:48. So I knew this HAD to be the year that I could break the sub 20 in the 5k. 

I kept running every day and dialed back my speed work to just one a week just in case my April race would be cancelled too. As you all know, it was cancelled but they turned it into a virtual run. So not quite the same as a real race, but I still ran the same exact course. I was determined to finally hit my goal I made 4 years ago. 

Unfortunately no one at my job likes to cover anyone when they ask for time off, so I had to work this morning. I showed up to the start line at 5:30 this morning. I went for a light 2 mile jog around the block and then did some strides at the end and some light stretches. I waited until exactly 6:00 am until I started, just in case my GPS on my phone died on me or did some inaccurate I could still have an idea of what my actual time was. I didn't want to get my hopes up for a fake time. 

I stripped down to just shorts and a t-shirt to run this race. It was god awfully cold too, 34 degrees. Fortunately there was no wind, and it wasn't too nippy. My body was warm and ready from the warmup. 

My goal for this race was to maintain a 6:15-6:20. My first mile was strong but probably a little too fast. I hit the first mile at 6:00 so I was ecstatic but dialed it back a little to maintain. At the 1.5 mile point there is a tall hill that practically kills me every year. And then from 1.5 to 2 miles is nothing but roving hills. I tried my best to push the speed down hill and maintain up hill. 

I took a look at my time again as I was getting closer to the end, I was at 2.8 miles with a time of 18 minutes. With quick math in my head, I figured that I had to keep at a pace of 40 seconds per .1 mile or else I wasn't going to make it. I sped up as much as I could maintain and held it to the end. I managed it finish the race in 19:53. Just 7 seconds shy of 20 minutes. 

I couldn't believe I had finally achieved my goal in this local race. A time of sub 20. I didn't think I would ever get there. I know I talked a big game when I thought I knew better about running, but I had no idea how much actual dedication was needed to get there. Figured I could do a few months of running, and I would be good. 

Now I have to keep going until I beat my high school PR.

A few people asked for an update after I posted feeling very emotional about a run clinic. I'm still super obese (obviously can't fix that in a month) and I ended up joining the run clinic as I mentioned in my post. The trainer at MEC is super enthusiastic, great runner, and beginner's classes are her favourite to teach, so she has continued to be very, very enthusiastic about not only helping me (despite being very large and very slow) but also about making sure I don't get hurt. 

I've been going every Saturday morning plus most of MEC's Monday drop-in runs. I do a brisk walk two other times during the week for half an hour and a yoga class when I can manage it. Today we did 5 km and I got it done in just under an hour which had been my original 5k time goal. I think I'll aim for 55 minutes next.   

As many of you mentioned, being this heavy means lots of walking, but jogging is feeling better and better. I wasn't able to jog as much today as I wanted due to pain in my Achilles, but the trainer was very firm that it's better to walk than to injure myself, so I'm rolling it out and feeling fine now.   

I am hoping that when I do my first 5k in a couple months that I'll be able to post it in the Achievement thread with pride. As of right now, I'm seeing all sorts of improvements in my life - I have more energy, my sleep is better, it's easier to go up multiple flights of stairs, but the best one has actually been an improvement in balance - I feel much more steady and agile and less like a lumbering beast. My body feels less like my enemy now. 

I really, really appreciate all the people who encouraged me and gave me advice, especially the ones advising to be cautious about injury. I am so glad I joined this run clinic and making that post here was a big reason I was able to push myself to do it. Thanks guys. ",running

After taking a few days off, my legs felt fresh and I was able to run 2 miles in 22:00 instead of the 24:00 I ran last week (I've just recently gotten back into running). Now that I'm home and showered I just feel so much more clear-headed and calm and ready to do a little bit of work whereas I would have normally pushed it off to tomorrow. I still don't feel 100%, but my run helped my mood go from like 25% to 75%, and sometimes I forget how much an effect running can actually have in reducing depression, anxiety, etc.

But just wanted to share - hope everyone is staying safe and healthy (physically and mentally)!",running

328,1485133633.0,Ran 50 miles on my 50th birthday,"[Strava data](https://www.strava.com/activities/837321686) for the 50 miles on my 50th birthday
So for the year leading up to my 50th birthday, I felt like I needed to do something epic. I didn't want to get drunk. I really don't see much satisfaction in drinking any more. I have an occasional celebration beer here and there. I didn't want a huge meal with friends and family. Heck, I've spent the last 9 years losing weight from 350 pounds down now to 193 at 6 feet 2 inches. Nope, I wanted to run 50 miles on my 50th birthday. That's exactly my kind celebratory gesture for turning 50!

I have run 11 marathons and 22 half marathons, I knew running 50 miles in a row wouldn't be a walk in the park. I ran the Monumental Marathon in November, and I felt like I was in pretty good shape. From there, I added some double long runs on the weekends and continued my normal training during the rest of week with Revolution Running. This got me to Christmas, when I knew that I wanted to run 50K as a test of my fitness. 

I had some fellow crazy runners meeting at midnight on Christmas morning to run as far as they could as an annual Suffer Fest in a local park, Washington Park. The path around Wash Park is 2.5 miles and a safe place to run. I like it a lot to run on during the winter. Plus they plow the inner road and if it snows, it is a great place to do 2.75 mile loops. Is it perfect? No, but the logistics are easy and runs there are not hard with relatively flat terrain. On Christmas, I ran 50K in 6 hours and it felt great. 

No I am not a speed demon, running 50 miles wouldn't be about speed. It would be about reflection and endurance, so I knew that I could attempt 50 miles less than a month away on 19 January. From Christmas to my birthday, I decided to taper a little and try to stay healthy for what I believed would be a true 12 Hour Sufferfest for me. 

To told my wife and my coaches at Revolution Running what I was doing, I'm sure that they thought I was crazy. Which is probably true, but I don't really care. Most people already think that I am crazy for just running anyways, so to add a few more people isn't a big deal. 

I decided to start my 50 mile run on my 50th at midnight in Wash Park. I hoped my start time would help people to not want to come out. This was to be a run in solitude for me and not meant throw kinks in other people's schedules. Plus I knew people would make a big deal about, because who the heck runs 50 miles just cause of a birthday. I don't like a lot press or pomp and circumstance. I just like to work hard, accomplish goals, and get things done. Heck, I don't even like it when like my Facebook posts, and I turn off notifications. If people like it, they like it. It doesn't matter to me.

Anyways my wife wanted to support, and there wasn't anything that I could do to sway her. We headed to Wash Park to get there and I would start at midnight. It had snowed a couple of days before, so the 2.5 mile outer loop was iffy at beast. I chose to do 2.75 mile inner loops, which would mean 18 loops. I reversed directions every couple of loops to change it up once in a while.

Most of the night was uneventful, which is the way that i like it. I was a robot and I was just getting it done. The weirdest thing to happen during the night was a raccoon sighting, and for the most part, I was just a solitary runner, trapped in his thoughts, shuffling through the night in Wash Park. 

Around 5AM, people started their daily running and walking routines in Wash Park. Everyone else was oblivious to my over night journey, which was fine by me. It was just nice not to be only one in the park. People and animals gave energy to keep going. 

Around 6AM, a few people joined me for a few laps and my wife ran the last 9 miles with me. This was mentally hardest part of the 50 miles. Physically, I felt great, but I had never run further than 50K before that night. I suffer from Imposter Syndrome and sometimes my brain would tell me to stop because I had no business running at all must less running for 50 miles. 

Anyways, I pushed the negative thoughts aside. Nothing was going to stop me from completing my 50 mile run at 50 quest. At 50 miles, I was so happy to have completed the quest with little or no problems. Now I can move on and start the next, better version of my myself, Bret.Version3.0. I hope to eventually qualify for the Boston Marathon, but I'm going to have to learn to run better and shuffle less. However, I'm confident that I can do it, and you can accomplish anything that you want to accomplish. Now go get it!

This afternoon the family and I went for a walk. When we were about 2 km away from the house we stopped at a field so husband and the boy could throw a ball around. I was playing with the dog. One minute she was fine. The next she was laying on then ground immobile, eyes rolled back, and had vomited all over herself. It was scary. 

I had to run back to the house to get the car so that we could take her to a 24hr vet. It was brutal. I've run that route more times than I can count, and it's a distance that would normally only take 10mins or less. Holy shit I'm out of shape. To be fair, I didn't have my inhaler with me so I wasn't able to take it before this impromptu run. But I had to keep stopping, and it took longer to get home than it should have. 

It's has occurred to me how important running is beyond just being a hobby or your flavor of exercise. As a society we've become too complacent. We rely too much on our vehicles and trust that we will always be safe. In a life or death situation how many people could actually run the distance that they need to to survive or save a life? Not many. So tomorrow I'm back to day one, and this time I have more of an understanding of the ramifications of what could happen if I slack off again. 

And yes, the dog is okay. She had three seizures before we got to the vet. The vet thinks that she must have gotten into something poisonous while on the walk, and said that we were lucky that we got her there when we did.",running

332,1590076478.0,Had my best run yet because of the advice on this sub,"Yesterday I posted twice - first about how to get through my third mile (was finding it really tough) and second to get out of my competitive mindset on Strava. I read Murakami's running book last night, and all of the brilliant advice on here, and I'm happy to say my run today was much, much nicer. 

Things I tried out:

1. Run \*slowly\* - advice on the sub said I was just running too hard, what really changed it for me was a comment that said my times ought to get faster, not drastically slower. And I set Strava to tell me my pace every .5 miles. My splits today were: 10:06, 10:29 (uphill), 09:17, 08:48 (downhill), 09.13 (last .2 of a mile). Most of it was really, really lovely.
2. . Murakami writes in the book that long-distance runners know each other by their breathing - it's slow, and calm. I used that as a metric to make sure I wasn't running too fast - could I breathe normally or no? 
3. Murakami wrote that he listened to a particular album when he was training - usually I mix the music up a lot and hate it, this time I banged on Stevie Wonder's Talking Book which I have really gotten into recently. Great choice. Superstition in the middle, ending on my favourite song - I Believe.
4. Someone commented that I should sabotage my own pace - skip in a circle, take a picture etc. Lovely advice, I had a great time doing a tiny bit of skipping, dancing a bit to my favourite song, generally not taking things too seriously. As the run progressed I wanted to run faster so I didn't do that after 2 miles but it was great to take the edge of the first mile when I was like ?am i running pathetically slow??
5. Generally advice from the sub about competing against yourself - I wanted to see could I run an \*honest\* run - no stopping, no running, just slow. And I did it for the first time - I felt like I could go on forever from mile 2-3, although pushed it a bit at the end (old habits die hard?)
6. Murakami wrote about his ultramarathon that he was talking to his limbs, coaxing them a bit. I was kind to my shins today, I said 'come on little shinnies, you can go a liiiittle bit further' and to my lungs 'good lungs look at you its okay' and it was much nicer than the usually annoyed mindset I have when things start to hurt. The shins are alright.

333,1601919215.0,I broke sub-4 marathon yesterday!,"Edit: sorry! The title should probably read I ran a sub-4 marathon. A kind person pointed out breaking sub-4 would actually be a sub-3 marathon...

3.56.02 to be exact. 

This is my second marathon, first “solo” (had some company most of the way), first marathon in September 2019 I ran 4.18 and I ran it just to finish. And if you were in the UK yesterday, you’ll know the conditions were brutal (thanks, storm Alex...)


I ran all my long training runs at 6min/km average except one where I had 19km out of 24km at ‘marathon pace’ that I over egged at 5.20/km and got dizzy. I spent the whole week leading up to the race preparing myself to fail my sub-4 attempt. And I would have done had it not been for my friend pacing me from 12km to 30km. I don’t know how to do proper race reports but for those who are interested, below is how my race played out...

I ran the first 12k 10s faster on average than I’d planned but it felt so easy that I figured I’d save up the seconds on my pace for later (probably the worst piece of marathon pacing advice ever, don’t do what I did). 

I picked up even more just before the half way point, then I started to feel it, which worried me a lot because in my last marathon I remember thinking how fresh I felt at 13 miles. But I managed to stick with the pace, running under 5.30/km for the majority. At 30k, I was 11 mins ahead of my goal and this made me feel great - I knew I could run 6/km for the rest and still make it. I was on a high then so felt like I’d already made it.

Until 37km when the wall hit...it was so late on I thought I’d be fine, but it was brutal. On top of this I think my garmin dropped out a bit as it kept saying I was running 7/km when I DEFINITELY wasn’t. Once it caught up, it turned out I was going 4.55/km to try and make it catch up...

But I made it. I’ve never been in more pain than I am today.

Things I learned:
Racing a marathon is a very different experience to running a marathon. 
Trust in your taper
Pacers are angels

While I knew it would be a small race (about 100 signed up), I got comped entry since I was involved in its sponsorship, and a free race is a free race.

It was Halloween themed, but with professional timing and awards, and a nice open course, so I figured I'd go for the W in a costume. I remember reading about a guy who won 5ks in ridiculous costumes here a few years ago (including a banana), so I figured I'd try it in a banana suit too.

The race went well except it was hard to see around corners through the face hole, and as I feared there weren't too many other serious runners, so it was a bit of a solo effort. I ran the course earlier as a warm up and knew where to go, so I motioned ahead to the pace car to let me pass and guide the rest of the group in, that way I felt a little better about it.

337,1617494577.0,Ran my first 15 miles - guess what? You can almost always can do more but your mind freaks out and tries to trick you into comfort,"Guys and gals, you WILL want to quit. Your body will scream IM DONE but usually you have *so much more power* than you believe.

I felt good at mile 6 or 7. My original intention was to do a 10 mile run so I said ""screw it"" and decided to try for 15 as it was my next milestone.

I started doing circles around my dorm for a while at 7 miles. At, I'm guessing, 10 miles the aching started to set in. Mentally it felt like I'd been running for a while. I *thought* i was at mile 12 or 13.

I made the mistake of checking my running app to see how long I'd run for....

*fuck only 11 miles in*

As soon as I saw that I had more 4 miles to go my brain went into panic mode and I wanted to quit. That's when all the pain, the aching, the soreness started to sink in.

It wasn't a race either. It was me against me at 2130 in the night.

I reached a point when I could have stopped. I eyed my dorm room and kept thinking ""11 miles is good that's 1 more than I've ever done""

I started thinking about all the comfort I could have if I quit on myself. My bed, some frozen fruit (personal fav) and more than anything - *cold water*.

The something clicked. I told myself I would finish and I finished strong. Once I kept going past the 12th mile I knew I would succeed I fought through the pain and motivated myself.

I finished with 15.10 miles that night. 

Walking bacn to my dorm was odd. I felt great but I felt like I was walking on air. Once the adrenaline ran out I felt the pain once again.

Guys, my legs hurt so bad I had to take a shower sitting down because when I stood they shook and ached and as crazy as it sounds - I felt amazing.

The achievement. The disbelief. 

We are stronger than we think we are. YOU are stronger than you think you are.

15 miles sounds impossible to some, but I used to only run 2. Then 2 became 3, so on and so forth. And now im running what I am today and will only get better.

I know this isn't revolutionary thought. Bodybuilders have been saying this forever but I finally got to see it myself and wanted to share it with everyone.

339,1597674594.0,PSA: Running Times and Health - Go see your doctor if your times start to fall and you have nothing to readily explain why,"Hey everyone,

Longtime lurker, first-time poster. I just wanted to post something about my recent experience to maybe help others out if they have a similar experience. I've run now for around ten years, regularly around three-miles a day, six days a week at a 10:00 min/mile pace.  About eight months ago, I noticed that my times started falling and my runs were getting a little more strenuous even though I hadn't changed anything up. Still running the same route and eating the same diet. In three months, I was struggling to run at a 12:00 min/mile pace. I thought this was weird, but I thought that I was maybe having a motivation problem or a burnout problem. So I powered through. I kept this up until around two or so months ago when I went in to see my GP for my yearly physical. My blood work showed my hemoglobin to be extremely low. After a couple of weeks of follow-up tests, come to find out I had a bleeding peptic ulcer that was causing constant blood loss, leading to anemia. I had the ulcer repaired and started taking iron supplements and now my times are right back to where they were before. I just wanted to let people know that i**f your times start falling fast and you have nothing to connect to it, it is time to see your doctor.** I feel like I dodged a bullet here because it could have been anything that was depleting my energy levels (i.e. cancer). Go get checked out if something similar happens to you.

341,1549167022.0,Race Report: I failed the NC State Krispy Kreme challenge,"Every year NC State hosts a race (this year February 2) where competitors and causal runners alike run roughly 2.5 miles, eat one dozen Krispy Kreme glazed donuts, and run another 2.5 miles back. To be considered a ""competitor"", you have to do all of this in under an hour. I'm 26 and ran my first marathon this past March, so I believed that 5 miles plus a very large meal would be something I could do. It was a very dumb thing to believe, and the Krispy Kreme challenge brutalized my body and my soul. Massive eating was not part of my training for this race. I thought I could get by on the fact that if I can run much farther than 5 miles, I could take that extra effort and convert it into donut consumption. Very bad math. Sad.

My friend Alex and I drove up from Charleston, SC on Friday after work. This was his fourth time competing, and would become his second time eating all twelve donuts and finishing in under one hour. We arrived around 9 pm, hung out with the people we were staying with for a bit (one of whom also competed), and went to bed. Alarm at 6 am, starting line around 7:55 am. Lots of costumes and cold hands.

The first 2.5 miles went smoothly. I haven't been training for speed at all the last few months, but knowing I was going to be losing time in the middle to stuff down a dozen cold, sugar-glazed donuts had me huffing it harder than I would've otherwise (About 8:25 a mile). Suffer the most at the beginning, and the rest gets easier right? Wrong. Because I had no idea what suffering would follow.

Long rows of tables stacked with boxes of Krispy Kreme's sat in the street. I slowed to a walk, grabbed a box, moved past the tables and tried to find a place to stand to start cramming them down. I brought some cheap gloves to keep the glaze off my hands, and smashed three against each other, making a donut burger. The first three weren't too bad. the next two (an open-faced donut sandwich) were a little more rough. While I ate, I slowed down, and spent more time watching the war zone in front of me. I saw a guy puke while another walked in small circles nearby, moaning. I saw a guy sitting on the sidewalk, legs splayed out in front of him, chewing morbidly with a dead look in his eyes, while an event photographer crouched in front of him, camera in his face, snapping picture after picture.

I went back to a donut burger for 6,7, and 8, and really started to hit a wall. The flavor of the sugar changed as my brain began to wake up to the horror I was committing against my stomach, and the sweetness became nauseous and overpowering. At this point each bite was being dipped into a cup of water to try and mitigate how dry and syrupy the donuts were making my throat, but it was not enough. By the end of those three, I feel like donuts had revealed themselves to me in a new way. Like when Nix shows Scott Bakula how he sees things in Lord of Illusions, or Roddy Piper puts the glasses on in They Live. I felt sick. They were disgusting, and I hated them. And I hated them even more because they'd beaten me. Trying to eat donut 9, my throat rejected each bite I tried to take. There was nothing more to do, I'd already taken a whopping 34 minutes. It was a lost cause, and I was a lost soul.

The prospect of running 2.5 more miles to finish, when I knew I had already failed the food portion of the challenge, and when I knew I wouldn't finish in under an hour, was bleak. I started running past identical puddles of vomit as the course began to sloping uphill. Each burp was nerve-wracking coming up, but liberating once it had passed. I got faster and faster as the donuts settled in my stomach, and was able to catch back up to a respectable pace. The finish line showed up out of nowhere, and I ran it in listening to Cannibal Ox. The 10 minutes afterwards were rough, as my body processed a couple different sensations that I'd call less than ideal.

I haven't decided if I'll come back next year or not. Part of me wants to conquer the donuts even more now that I've failed against them, and realized how intensely difficult they are for me. Part of me never wants to touch another goddamn donut. It's a little too soon to say. But it felt rewarding to fail, and to understand in a physical way how difficult the challenge is.

343,1609867472.0,What I've Learned From Surveying Almost 400 Runners Who've Qualified for Boston,"Hey Runnit,

Over the years I've run a project called ""the Boston Qualifier Questionnaire"" (or BQQ for short) where I ask runners who've qualified for Boston a series of questions. Many, many runners of reddit have taken part. With the new year here, I thought I'd share a bit of what I've learned. [You can read all the individual responses,  (and submit your own!) here.](https://miloandthecalf.com/the-bq-questionnaire/)

*A warning before we get started -- this post contains discussion of body weight and its possible effect on qualifying. I want to be 100% clear that runners can qualify for Boston at a range of weights but feel that it is an important topic to discuss. If talk of body weight is triggering for you, you may wish to skip ""The Vitals"" section.* 

## The Vitals.

I asked participants in the survey for some basic biological facts, including their height and weight. Runners came in all shapes and sizes from huge, like [Michael H](https://miloandthecalf.com/2012/09/13/the-bqq-michael-h/), to small, like [Laura S](https://miloandthecalf.com/2014/09/11/the-bqq-laura-s/).

If we can generalize, however, BQ runners tend to be lighter (for their height) than the average American and slightly shorter.

The average weight for male respondents was 157 pounds. The average height, 5’8”. For comparison, the average American male is (allegedly, these statistics may be inaccurate) approximately 5'9 and thirty three pounds heavier (190 pounds).

The story is similar for women — remarkably so in the weight differential. The average respondent is roughly 5’4” and weighs 125.4 pounds. By comparison, the average American woman is approximately 5’ 4” but weighs about 33 pounds more (159 pounds).

On a personal note, I’m six feet tall and currently weigh about 175 pounds. That puts me about fifteen pounds heavier than the average six foot respondent. Clearly, I have work to do on the weight front.

## Training

Alright, enough height and weight. Let’s get down to what really matters — the training.

Most runners had been running for less than six years before they first qualified, and had run less than ten thousand miles when they qualified. Of course, there are outliers, like pro-runner [Sage Canady](https://miloandthecalf.com/2015/11/16/the-bqq-sage-canaday-hoka-one-one/), who’d been running a relatively short amount of time, but racked up some serious miles, or [John](https://miloandthecalf.com/2013/06/12/the-bqq-john/) who’d been running for over twenty years before he qualified.

For mileage in the year before the race, there appears to be a fair amount of consistency across the responses. Almost no runners ran under 1,000 miles, and few ran above 2,500. The average is the difficult, but not unreasonable, standard of 1,750 miles.

On a personal note, the only year I ran that much was the year I set my marathon PR. Clearly, mileage matters.

No surprise that for most of us, it takes more than miles to qualify. The vast majority (84% of those who answered the question) say that speed work played a role.

While the vast majority of respondents used speed work in their training, the majority of runners (about 60%) didn’t use a canned program.

Similarly, the majority (64%) of runners didn’t run with a coach or club, nor did they engage in cross training.

Finally, when I started doing this, I wondered if there was a correlation between a background in running, such as those afforded by high school and college teams, and getting a BQ. As this is still a small, and self-selected group, it’s hard to know. But what we do know is that the majority (63%) of respondents did not run either in college or high school.

## Some quick takeaways.

What can we take away from these results? Here are some initial thoughts, most of which are obvious. I’ll be curious to hear your thoughts in the comments.

* You need to put in the miles – very, very few of the respondents did this on low mileage.
* You need to do speed work – similarly, the vast majority of runners utilized some form of speed work.
* People with lots of different body weights and compositions can BQ, but Boston Marathon Qualifiers tends to be lighter than the average American.
* Getting a BQ happened to most respondents early in their running lives, usually after having run only for five or so years, and less than 10,000 miles.",running
344,1617731269.0,I am 1/4 of the way through running 48 Half Marathons in 48 days across every English county,"Hey guys, firstly a general thank you to the advice and discussion that I regularly consume on this forum.

Earlier this year my family were in desperate need to raise money for my cousins mobility equipment, she is a 16 year old who suffers with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome from birth.

I’d been running religiously over lockdown mainly for my mental health and sanity and had a luxury of free time thanks to being off work because of covid, so I decided to take up an extreme running challenge to hopefully raise eyebrows and cash.

Having started March 26th, I am a quarter of the way through running a Half Marathon in every English County across consecutive days, I started in my home county of Somerset and have since completed 12 of 48 half’s, and am currently writing to you from Brighton (East Sussex).

I don’t know if anyone finds this interesting but thought it would be worth putting on here, so if anyone has any questions about the challenge and how it’s going or if you’ve done anything similar and have advice then it is greatly appreciated, perhaps I’ll do a more detailed post if there’s interest.

On my end, I’m in pretty good shape. I work out at a crossfit gym 5/6 days a week and overall am a decent runner and my cardio is strong. I’ve only ever run a 13.1 half marathon and it was brutal. The slow wear and tear got to me and there was a lot of pain at the end. 

He said we’ll run/walk it and he doesn’t care if it takes 10hr to finish, it’s the joy he’ll get from doing it together that matters to him. He estimated we’ll finish in 6’ish hours.

My example: a couple weeks ago I was running (lol) late for an important meeting and my free parking garage in the city was about a mile from the building I had to be at. Rather than paying extra to park my car closer in order to arrive on time, I was able to still park a mile away in the garage and run to the building.

348,1606669740.0,Running saved my life and made me a better person. Personal story.,"Background: up until the age of 22 or so, I was fit and active. Things went downhill when I neglected my health and my body. Started working, got married, life busy, and so on. All of that made me lazy and I started putting on weight and making excuses. I reached 220lbs (100kg) at my peak. I am now 32, turning 33 soon.

I starter getting health problems and it got to the point where I deteriorated so fast, I looked like a rotten potato.

The story: In August, my daughter's third birthday, I got very sick. I went to see the doctor. He simply said that I am ok but I need to change my lifestyle, my food, and get physically active.

On August 27, 2020, I made a promise to myself to be there for both my daughters and I needed to start with my health and physical fitness.

I started running. I keep on running. I don't like it very much, but honestly, it is giving me the best results. Better than I could hope for. I lost 17 kgs, my clothes don't fit me no more.

My body started ticking on it's own. When it is time to run, I get up and start running. I must admit that I am not the best runner, I don't hit the numbers or the right time, I don't follow conventional running rules, but I do one thing and one thing consistently. Every day I must go and run. If I am too tired or need to recover, I walk.

I started with 2k. Within a week, I am doing 5-7k.
By mid October, I can do the occasional 14k.
Now, I do 14k twice a week, and run 5k 4 times a week. With one day off.

I just completed my first 21k. Yeah, it took 3 hrs and 40 minutes, but it is something I didn't do since I was 16.

Now: I am a healthier person, looking better, more energetic and available for my wife and kids. I wake up early. I am eating better and my family is eating better because of me. I spend more time with my kids, rather than sleeping.

I am better at work. I earn better. I literally became a better person, a father, and a husband. All thanks to RUNNING.

351,1591921522.0,A word of encouragement for all those feeling down,"Hi everyone, I’m a lurker but felt inclined to write a note.

I wanted to extend thanks to our amazing bodies that can run, heal and build as we enjoy this sport. 

I see a lot of posts here that make me sad. There are many of you on here that express their frustrations with times, distances and capacity. I wanted to share my story as a word of encouragement. You are good enough and everyone develops at their own pace. Run for enjoyment or for competition, but remember why you do it and how lucky you are to be able to. 

I started seriously running around 3 years ago. Following a never ending bout of bad mental health, school/work stress and an anorexia diagnosis, little did I know I was destined for change. As my weight increased and I felt ‘normal’ again post-recovery I wanted to be strong and manage my anxiety. 

I was, and am, so, so grateful for the gift that running is. It is a privilege to be able bodied and be able to work and push myself. It really changed my life. I was always getting faster, pushing myself for longer distances, and registering for a marathon in the near future didn’t seem impossible. Until the worst happened.

Last August I was hit by a car while cycling. I will spare the gross details but my right leg was absolutely mangled. It took months of healing from the staples, the wound, a stubborn infection and an allergic reaction to antibiotics. By the end of 2019 I was finally clear. But, I had been forced to take so much time off running. My muscle mass was totally gone and I was so disheartened. It took me well into this year to get back to it.

My time sucks compared to this time last year. My lung capacity sucks. But I’m out there again, running to the best of my ability. I beat myself up for so long for being inactive. I can’t believe how hard I was on myself. It was as easy as just putting on my shoes, playing my favourite playlist and going outside.

Here’s the lesson I learned and I hope may help someone out. Be kind to yourself. Be gentle. Know your limits and work within them. You are good enough and as long as you try and push yourself when you can you will be successful. Everything is a work in progress and sometimes we are set back by unfortunate circumstances.

356,1594326195.0,"What I learned on a 100-day run streak (or, how I learned to love running slow)","First, a bit of background. I'm in my late 40s. I've been running seriously for about four years. During that time, I've hit 1,000 miles for a year twice, run a marathon and several half marathons. I'm not fast. I did my marathon in 4:04. I'm not small. I'm 6'4"" and about 240 pounds, so you might accurately call me ""lumbering.""

I've started each of the last three years with the same goal: to average 5km a day for an entire year, which works out to about 1,135 miles. I came within 100 miles of getting there in 2018. Last year, I had some injuries, and generally saw my motivation fall off. Only a late surge got me to 750 miles for the year. 

Nevertheless, I began 2020 with the same goal. But after pounding out a 10km on New Year's morning, I quickly fell behind. Motivation was once again lacking. 

Then coronavirus hit. I haven't been to my office since March 12, which saves me about 2 1/2 hours a day of commuting time. I've never been a morning runner -- I found it too difficult to get up early enough on weekdays to get my miles in and still get to work on time. But suddenly faced with working from home, I realized I could rise at a reasonable hour, get a decent run in, and be showered and ready to work before 9. 

I tried it out, and decided I liked starting my day that way. I quickly put together a seven-day running streak. My legs were tired, so I took a day off. The next day was April 1, and I haven't had a day off since. Which means that, as of this morning, I have run 100 days in a row. 

I realize that for many on this board, a 100-day streak of mostly 4-ish mile runs isn't that special. But  I'm a pretty average runner, and for me, it's a big deal. I think my previous long streak was 12 days. This effort has taught me a few things about how my body reacts, and I thought it might be helpful for some others on this board to share that. 

When I started this streak, I was mostly running miles in the low 9-minute range, which has pretty much been my standard training pace for the last couple of years. If I went longer on the weekends, I might nudge that up to 9:30 or so. But I learned pretty early on that with no rest days to let my legs recover, the only way to do this was to get slower. 

So I tried an experiment on one of my weekend long runs. I set my watch view to only display heart rate. Typically my HR on runs is in the 150-160 range. I decided to do a 10-miler while keeping my HR under 140. Then I tried it at 130. My times slowed dramatically, to the high 10-minute, low 11-minute range. But I had much more energy to finish the runs and I wasn't nearly as destroyed the next day. This became my new routine. Weekends were for going slow. Really, really slow. A few years ago, I would have been mortified to post those sorts of paces. But I learned to embrace it as part of a different challenge - teaching my body to perform day, after day, after day. 

Weekdays, when I never went longer than 5 miles, I kept an eye on my pace, but I still ran by feel. Some days I was quicker, and some days I was slower. and some days, I just did. not. have. it. There weren't many of those, but when they struck, they included some walking breaks. I decided to embrace all of it. 

Those 100 days netted me just under 475 miles, and I'm happy to report that I am now ahead of pace for averaging a 5km a day for an entire year. My body actually feels pretty good. Other than some lingering heel soreness, which was helped by switching from Saucony Kinvaras to Freedom 3s, I don't have anything close to an injury. I never came close to not running because I didn't feel well. 

Will I run tomorrow? I don't know. I'm torn. Part of me wants to keep the streak going and another part of me doesn't want to have my life governed by it. I guess I'll see how I feel when I wake up, but I'll probably end up getting out there.

357,1555247141.0,Accidentally ran 10 miles instead of a 5K at my race yesterday.,"TL:DR: Pretty much the title 

Ran my typical 5K yesterday. Except it also coincided with a 10 miler. I either missed the turn for the 5K or went the wrong direction on the split.  

MapMyRun hit 4 miles, but I didn’t think anything of it cause that app frequently has more mileage than the official race route for some reason. (This year’s Shamrock Shuffle 8K was officially 5 miles but MapMyRun logged me at 5.86 🤷🏻‍♀️). Then I hit mile 5 and was like “I’m an dumbass”. Went to the nearest race official and told her I apparently got on the 10 mile course and missed the 5K. She was confused so I pointed to my bib, which not only said 5K on it but was a completely different color than the 10 miler. I asked her aside from just turning around where the nearest short cut to the finish line was. She had no idea, but the turn around for the 10 mile to go back up was only about a block ahead. So, I turned around and began to jog/walk it back. Cut across a field and avoided the giant hill near the finish. Was so tired I didn’t want to do the loop around the track at the end to cross the finish line and an official redirected me when I tried to cut in to cross the finish line.  Sooo. I never technically finished. Walked up to a guy handing out medals. Told him I ended up getting on the wrong course and asked if they had any 5K medals left (cause I was waaaaay past finish time and I for SURE ran that 5K). He laughed; said it was the same medal and handed me one. I don’t think I ever saw someone laugh so hard. 

Long story short. This is my 25/26th race in 5 years. The longest race I’ve ever done was a 10K in 2017 plus a buncha 5K and a few 7K/8K.  I haven’t been running regularly for 2 years. This is my 2nd race since last August. I wasn’t paying attention and ended up running 10 MILES instead of 3.2.

My drink of choice is craft beer. Recently, I decided to take a long break from drinking for several reasons, which I won't go into here. My first day was August 1st, and I've been holding up pretty well. 

With running, I've noticed some benefits to having cut alcohol that I hadn't considered when I was still drinking. Here's some of them:

1. Quicker recovery time. As a 39 year old, the necessary recovery time has increased every year. This week, I've run 27 miles . I ran two 5+ mile runs with less than 12 hours between the two this week. Both outings were great! I'm not experiencing very much muscle pain.

2. Feeling better. Regardless of having been a heavy drinker, I'm still a morning person. Still, I've felt like shit in the morning for so long, I just accepted it, and dealt with it on the morning running. In the past week, I've felt pretty good before walking out the door. No hangovers. No body aches.

3. Losing weight. I'm not extremely heavy, but still overweight. As a 5'11"" male, I've gone from 193 to 182 in 12 days. My beer belly is starting to shrink. My goal is 160 by the end of September. 

4. Lower heart rate. I know the garmin HRM isn't completely accurate, but I noticed my heart rate is down 15 points from what it normally is on the same runs.

My life is busy and having to wake up 2-3 hours sooner than I would need to has taken its toll. I was lying in bed this morning and decided that it wasn’t worth it. My mental health is more important.

### Training
For context, I'm a weightlifter. I compete in the snatch and clean and jerk, and I'm training for my fifth trip to University Nationals. Running is NOT something I've ever enjoyed or thought I was good at. This summer I was looking for a challenge, so I decided to change my personal narrative on my fitness and running. I started with a local Park Run, signed up for a few 5Ks, and caught the bug!

I signed up for the 10K many weeks ago, presumably a step on my way to a half. Then chronic illness hit. I've been struggling with a neurological condition and chronic pain for years, but things got out of control this summer. My illness is hard enough, but the medications I'm on for treatment have made exercise all but impossible. For weeks, I couldn't stand up without half fainting, and was too weak to carry my own backpack. Of course my training turned into a large dumpster fire as I tried to juggle medical school and my health, AND my weightlifting training, AND my casual running training. It's been a trip. 

### Pre-race
In all honestly, it was a mess. I almost dropped out a million times. Last week, I was too weak to get out of bed. This week, I was in too much pain to leave the house. But this race was so important to my heart and fight that I knew I had to do it. I felt well enough yesterday to make the drive from New Orleans to Lafayette, checked into my Airbnb, and tried to stay calm.

I barely slept because of pain and nerves, but thankfully my dog helped snuggle me to sleep for a few hours. Before I knew it, I was at the start line. And BOY was I nervous. I've competed in national weightlifting meets and national pageants, but this local 10K was the scariest thing I've ever done.  As the countdown ticked, I started a podcast, took a deep breath, shot a few words up to God, and got running.

### Race
The 10K crowd was tiny compared to the 5K crowd that was starting 45 minutes after us, and I was thrilled to keep up with most of them for the first mile. Then (due mostly to my meds but also to my lack of conditioning) I hit a wall. From there, it was a true grind. I really disliked the course (basically through a fancy subdivision with lots of turns). I was also DEAD LAST the entire time. Like, police car following me with the lights on to make sure I didn't get lost or fall type of dead last.

It was a painful blur. I won't lie, in the middle I got very frustrated. I hate not feeling athletic anymore. I hate not feeling like myself. I hate seeing minutes added to my mile pace, and feeling my legs turn to lead after only a mile.

But I did it.

### Post-race
Banana, electrolytes, water, and pain meds down the chute ASAP. I hung around to enjoy the crowd for a bit, then headed back to check out of the Airbnb, grab my dog, and drive back home to watch some Michigan football (Go Blue!).

It was slow. It was ugly. I felt awful, unhealthy, and painful. But you know what? This girl, who was literally too weak to get out of bed last week, finished her first 10K. And had a police escort the entire way. What a day!

The person said: don’t rush into a jog, save your stamina for later and here I am, the thinnest and happiest I’ve been in years having lost nearly 17kg in 3 months from jogging and dieting. 

You changed my life and reminded me what being happy in myself felt like. Additionally, I have been able to take up jogging without the restrictive authoritarian voice in the back of me telling me how much of a failure I am.

The key I had to beat that was to come up with a variety of different jogging locations which then restricted my brain from comparing my weekly jogs.

Thanks for everything and I hope this post may inspire others to keep up their jogging habits too! 

Happy jogging! :)",running

There are 949k members in this subreddit and usually 1.5k-2k online at any given time. Despite this, there are only 20 threads this week that have more than 50 upvotes. Some threads disproportionately skyrocket Like: ""Ran my longest run today of 9.24 miles, while pushing my son in a stroller!"" (2.1k upvote) or ""Beginners dont worry about other peoples times"" (1.3k upvotes).

Take today's top hits for example and here is the breakdown:

1.4k - [Where my thick-thigh running girls at?](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/gx4m47/where_my_thickthigh_running_girls_at/)

135 - [105.5 laps on a track for 26.2 miles](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/gx7pre/1055_laps_on_a_track_for_262_miles/)

20 - [I just ran 4K after not running since September!](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/gx7vez/i_just_ran_4k_after_not_running_since_september/)

Then many of threads that have minuscule upvotes (despite some having many comments).

I am also surprised by the number of threads that have 0 upvotes despite having quite a few comments and seemingly good content/questions/etc. The daily Q&A threads get a decent amount of traffic and comments and almost no upvotes.

So to my original question: Is there an algorithm problem in this subreddit, or do people in this sub just never upvote (which seems contrary to the supporting nature, comments, and upvoted comments frequently seen)? Is this possibly due to our forum being more text driven than photos which tend to get more upvotes?

Well, it’s been far better than I expected so I thought I’d share. 

I’ve been running seriously for a few years now, and ran my first marathon last year. I never really lost a ton of weight because I never changed my drinking or eating habits. I had broken my shoulder leading up to this, so hadn’t been running for a few months when I gave up drinking. 

Well, the pounds started shedding faster than I expected. I had a goal to lose 13 lbs, and am currently at about 25 lbs lost. My running has taken off. I just absolutely destroyed a large hill I’ve run many times in the past, accomplishing it in about 2 min/mile faster than ever before. The results, both physically and mentally couldn’t be more encouraging. 

I know it’s sorta obvious; improve your bodily inputs, lose lots of weight, start killing it on your routes. But I knew it would help for a long time, and never did what I knew I needed to.

It got to me. He's usually a very laid back person and now he is bitching about this random old guy. This old guy clearly doesn't have a runners build, it doesn't look like his exercise is a breeze, and sure he is going really slow. But why should anyone care?

So, no wonder when Corona hit and life got very uncertain I relapsed into old habits. 
I’ve always been an alright runner but never particularly trained, just doing Parkrun and the sort here and there. 

I picked up running again in March to lose weight and increase my calorie deficit, it was unhealthy and I had virtually no energy to finish any runs. However, at some point I started to love the feeling of finishing a run, then the feeling of doing a fast 5k. I knew to run longer I had to eat beforehand and so I would, then I would eat afterwards to fix my muscles so I could run harder next time. I started getting PBs and running longer than I ever had before and eating so much more than I ever had before. I now eat about 1500 more calories a day than I used to and I feel amazing. 

Running had tricked me into eating more without even knowing at first. 
And the best part is, for the first time I can remember, I’m happy with my body. Not because of the muscle gain or fat loss due to running, but because my body can take me through two hours of country side just on my feet and doing all these things I never thought I could because of my health. I ran my first ever half marathon, PB 10k and PB 5k all in the last 2 weeks and i’m excited to get even faster (and eat even more).

373,1602259126.0,"My results after 1 year of taking running more seriously. Focusing on running slower, more consistently and low heart rate from a very average runner.","**Introduction**

So, early 30s, 65kg/140lbs now but got fat in my 20s and decided to pick up running a couple of years ago. My first 10km was 1:09:xx in 2016 and got this down to about 58 minutes by 2018. Just to give you an idea of my ability, I wasn't great but I definitely saw a lot of improvement just by running randomly. Had lots of aches and pains in the first year or so but nothing too serious.

&#x200B;

In late August 2019, I decided to take running more seriously. I had some time during the summer to read up on doing the long distance weekend run, to run slower, to try to keep your heart rate low and all that stuff. I thought I would give it a try because ultimately, I liked the idea of running slow.

&#x200B;

**Results**

So one year later approximately (been meaning to write it up for a month), here are my results!

To give you an idea of my monthly distance and average pace for the month, please see below. All results are in kilometres or minutes/km. You can see the increase in mileage and pace slowing in September onwards. I had a slight niggle in late March (coincided with sitting around all day during COVID lockdown but it might have also been my old trainers I failed to replace over the winter running) hence the drop in mileage there.

**""Plan""**

My plan was to run 4 days a week with one day being a speed session (hills, intervals) and one day being a long run (around 90 minutes or anywhere from 12 to 21km). Other 2 days is just a nice gentle run.

**Heart Rate/Training pace?**

My target was to keep my heart rate under 150. I've read about a ton of issues about looking at heart rate and I don't know what my max is (although I've seen it hit 199-200 in my runs before) but I went with 150.

I also went with just how I felt, in terms of my breathing, how long I felt I could keep going for. In terms of under 150, my breathing generally felt easy enough to hold a conversation which I read was a good marker as well.

**So what was it like?**

My first 'slow' run was really difficult, I set myself about 6:10 min/km pace but I did 15km at 6:05 pace, average HR 155bpm.

A month later in September, 14km at 6:21 min/km pace, average HR 148bpm.

Over the next couple of months, I found out that about 6:20-6:30 pace was what I needed to keep my heart rate from going too high.

**Results**

While I could go analyse every one of my runs over the 12 month period, I'll start with a simple start/end 10k that I did.

1st September 2019 - 10km - 52:08 - average HR 180 bpm, min 142 bpm - max 194 bpm.

1st September 2020 - 10km - 49:10 - average HR 168 bpm. min 91 bpm - max 179 bpm.

&#x200B;

I was pleased to have improved my 10km time by approximately 3 minutes but what was most interesting to me and this is applicable to a lot of my faster runs this year is that although I am going faster than I have ever been before, my heart rate never reaches as high as it used to even though I feel like I'm still giving it 100%.

I rarely reach the aforementioned heart rates of 190-200 even when I am going for a 5k PB and on runs where I do go fast, it also takes longer for me to reach a high heart rate. I would hit 170\~ in a few minutes but now it could be 10 or 12 minutes in before I even get close.

My 5km times have also dropped from about 24:50 to about 23:30 in the same time period.

**Conclusion**

Ultimately, I don't know what helped me improve the most. I think it all worked well together. I was able to run more because I was running slower, I know I was running slower by being more aware of my running pace, breathing and heart rate and because I am running more, I am aerobically fitter hence my better heart rate.

Make of it what you will but one side effect I didn't expect is that since I was running on a schedule, no matter the weather or how I felt that day, I was out there . Rain, storms, high wind speeds, floods, general lethargy, lack of sleep affects me a lot less than it used to! I may have had to dial it back a little bit on those days but I still got out there which is the main thing!",running
374,1590950609.0,My 1 year journey from depression and not being able to run a mile to sub25 5k and 125km in May,"I’m aware these numbers are absolutely nothing for most of you. I’m just happy with where I am and have just reached 125km for the month, which is a record for me (first time over 100km altogether) and also realized it has been a year since I started, so wanted to share it in the off chance it may help or motivate someone.

June last year I came out of a bad breakup and was pretty down. At 30 yo (male, 172cm and 88kg, therefore overweight) I was extremely sedentary. My own thoughts were killing me so I took up running as a way to start being active but mostly to keep me busy and not in a house full of memories and feelings.

I was in bad shape and could not run one kilometre without stopping. I see now that I was also running way too hard because I didn’t know any better. I kept at it, running a couple times a week and eventually worked up to like 3-4k. Then a friend suggested I tried a Parkrun - I was scared but registered online and went for it. Took me nearly 39 minutes but I did it and didn’t die so I was pretty happy.

This was a massive turning point because (even though the speed was low) I realized I could actually run 5k without stopping and that IT WAS ALL MENTAL. Every other time I stopped at 3-4k saying I could not do any more, that was not due to my legs or chest - that was my mind giving in. I’ve started running more and in a more structured way, with a speed day, a long day, learning to go slower, etc. Through rainy UK days, though poorly lit nights. I was enjoying the ride.

I made it to 32 minutes for a 5k and then to 30 and was really happy. That was at absolutely max effort and stuff like sub 25 minutes seemed something I would never ever achieve but I was happy to just work towards it. My mind was clear, though, and I started getting a feeling of accomplishment that helped me turn other areas of my life. I was not too old, my body was not too far gone, I was not hopeless, after all.

However breaking the 30 minute barrier seemed impossible. Even with speed and tempo days this did nothing to get me faster. I eventually did a 10k in a bit over an hour and was pretty happy with this. Again, it gave me the motivation to realize that 10k seemed impossible months ago but I did it, the same way that 5k seemed impossible before, so maybe something like a half marathon was not less possible as long I worked for it.

Anyway lockdown happened and all races got cancelled. I started focusing more on adding volume and not caring about pace. I went to something like 30 km weeks (again, I know not much for you but for me it was) mostly at low HR and enjoying being out there. I always heard that you needed to go slow to go fast but never believed it. I was obviously wrong.

Some weeks ago I decided to try myself at a 5k and did it in 27 minutes. Intrigued, I continued to run slow miles and adding volume and last week thought I'd give it a good try. I felt like death but did it in 25 minutes even and could not be happier. I called all my running buddies (who are all really supportive despite being 10 times faster) and could have cried. I’ve also lost a lot of weight (not just from running but controlling what I eat – no mad diets, just responsibly) and I’m down to 70kg which I’m sure helps.

One of the main things was gaining that confidence to tell my body who’s in control. Sometimes I was tired and wanting to stop but I’d thing “stfu little legs, you’ll stop when we want to stop”. Obviously I’m not talking about doing something disproportionate and unreal like running 50k out of sheer will. But not giving up at 8k during a training run and focusing myself to get to 10k as planned and even go past it, gave me that motivation to use that atitude in other areas of my life. I’m in control - not my legs, not my job, not my SO, not my circumstances. I’m in charge.

This weekend I tried to run 10k (my longer days are longer than that but at slow pace) and see what happened – I was not at full effort but did 55 minutes so that’s another goal (less than an hour) achieved. I’ve also finished this month with 125km on Strava which is a new record for me – in fact I never did more than 100 before, and it was funny to realize that it has been a year. I have a half marathon in October (doubt it goes ahead but I’ll run it by myself if it comes to it) and I want to aim for around 2 hours. It will be in my hometown (Lisbon, I live in the UK now) so it will be extra special.

I don’t know what’s the point of this rant, rather than to say – if you just started, keep at it. Stuff that seemed impossible, will come to you in time. If you are in a dark place, running may help give you part of what you need. I'm not a talented runner but I have fun with it and compared with where I was a year ago (mentally and physically) I’m so happy. For a while I worried I was just running away from something, but now I feel I’m running towards something better instead. Stay safe out there!",running

376,1615244644.0,It's okay to bike instead (or swim or lift or whatever else),"I'm making this thread because I needed to see something like this a year ago.

Around this time last year, at the tender age of 23, I came to grips with the fact that my knee cartilage was injured and it wasn't going fully heal, and as a result I was probably not going to run (or at least not at the level I previously did) again. 

This completely broke me, and for the better part of a year. And I'm happy to say I'm doing well now! At the time I couldn't take the news and went into a long deep depression and equated the news that I had cartilage issues in my knee and wasn't going to be able to run to meaning I was never going to be able to exercise hard again. THAT ISN'T TRUE. You absolutely still can, and you can enjoy it.

Part of the reason I was so broken over the prospect of not being able to run again is how many memories I had of running. I put it on such a pedestal and thought nothing could replace it, I thought I just wouldn't be happy with exercising again. I still look back fondly on memories of running, but I don't pine over them anymore. That's because I've found other forms of exercise, namely biking currently, that give me a lot of what I loved about running, like being outside, feeling free, and getting winded, and I learned to love it as I did running. That part is crucial, that I accepted biking into my heart as something I could love. You can make new memories doing new forms of exercise. You can have just as good of a workout doing different activities. You can love them the same way. I'm more of a mental case than I'd like to admit, so I believe if I was able to get through this, you will as well. Feel free to DM me if any of this is relevant to you.",running

So here is is... 
I've had my MIL staying with me for a while now, which for the most part has been ok, however, last night she had her cousin and 11 year old daughter swing by my place for a cuppa. Cousin and daughter had been in 5 minutes when I hear her mention that daughter had been off school and when MIL asked why, she said it was for a sore leg. Phew, I thought!
I venture out of my room to say hello and ask how the cousin is, and she replies with ""not great""... ""Why?"" I ask. She then tells me she has this ""horrible cold"" and then I remember she's an insane covid denying moron. Great...

Long story short, I've been very careful covid wise. Paranoid, some have said, but whatever. I very quickly feel a surge of adrenaline, serious fight or flight feelings. In that moment, I don't know if I'm going to scream, cry, or just straight up punch this selfish, ignorant B**TARD who's currently sitting on my sis next to my elderly MIL.

Then it hit me, there was another option... I stormed out the room, aggressively laced up my new Brooks Ghost 12's and just left. I got out into the street, shaking and crying, and just started running. 14.2km and 1hr 9min later and I was calm. Angry, but calm.

It's now the next morning, my ankles and calves are a little achey, but other than that I'm fine.

Had I not gone on that run, it's likely I would have called every mutual acquaintance of this woman and told them what she's done and probably would've made myself out to be an utter psycho in the process. I also probably wouldn't have slept and would be sitting here in a migraine fog right now. Instead I've just sent out a group text and left it at that.

383,1562632826.0,I ran 4 miles without stopping today. Here’s why I’m proud.,"I’m a high-school track and cross country runner. I’ve been on varsity every single year. I’ve gone on 10 mile runs at 6:30 pace. I’ve run 16:30 for the 5k. And yet, I think my 4 mile run at 7:14 pace might be one of the proudest moments I’ve ever had as a runner.

Here’s why:

So I’ve always had stomach issues, and it’s always impacted my running. It got to the point where it was almost a fact of life. My doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me, and I just had to deal with it. So it didn’t worry me during at my spring track district championships when I ran 20 seconds slower than my personal bests in both the 800m and mile. I mean, I felt awful, and I knew something was wrong with me, I just kinda shrugged and said “oh well”.  I shrugged off the feelings of pain in my stomach because I figured it was normal for me.

Little did I know, as I found out a few weeks later, I had appendicitis.

So I had surgery, and I waited to heal. I wanted to get back out and run, but I had to wait. Honestly, it got into my head a lot. I felt like I’d come back, and it just wouldn’t be the same. I felt like I’d be slower. I lost all motivation to run. And I just felt like my last season running high school cross country was predestined to be terrible.

Once I was able to run again, I started building up, nonetheless. Increasing mileage little by little. And that brings me to today. It wasn’t fast for me. It wasn’t long for me. But I ran 4 miles without stopping, and honestly, I’m so freaking proud of myself for doing that, because that’s more than I’ve been able to do in so long. And I felt something today I haven’t felt in a long time. When I got to the last hill I pushed myself to the end of my run. I didn’t walk, or start slowing down. I finished it. I got through it.

Just thought I’d share, cause I’m really happy about it :).",running
384,1398169950.0,The last runner at Boston,"Hope you guys don't all mind one more post about Boston, just wanted to give one last update from the finisher's-medals volunteer area.  (edit for non-r/running readers: I'd been doing regular updates from the marathon in another /r/running thread.) At 6pm almost all volunteers left and the BAA was officially dismantling the course but there were still some straggler runners, so it ended up that me and 2 other guys just kept hanging out waiting to give medals to stragglers. We started hearing these periodic tiny bursts of cheers and realized there was still a little clutch of people in the grandstand cheering on the last stragglers, so at about 6:30pm I asked for, and was granted, the ok to go stand right on the finish line with the last medals for the last stragglers. The whole BAA apparatus was actually being shut down by then, the course was officially closed, the timer pads were gone, the clock was gone, they were dismantling the grandstands, and the runners were having to seriously dodge the street-sweeper machines, but there were still stragglers coming in! 

At about 7:30 we stopped seeing runners but we still didn't want to give up - especially this year of all years, since we knew some runners were re-running after not being able to finish last year, and we just didn't want to give up on anybody. So me and the 2 other guys waited (seriously the last BAA volunteers in sight at this point - it turned all 3 of us had been in the thick of it last year and it seemed all 3 of us just had this thing in our heads about wanting to be there to the end). Cops shooed us off course, we shooed off temporarily, we drifted back on course, we waited, and at about 7:50pm, lo and behold, there in the distance in the dark is this little tiny figure in the dark dodging the gigantic street-sweeper machines, with the white bib number just visible. One last runner! The runner got closer and it was this just annihilated-looking girl, who had clearly been hurt and must have had to walk a large part of the course but obviously was determined not to DNF. The only people around were about a dozen tourists taking pictures posing on the finish line, a bunch of cops, and construction guys dismantling the grandstand, and EVERYBODY started cheering for her. Like, huge big cheers. And she actually managed to break into a decent little trot and put her arms up to cross the finish. And then she just started bawling. (When I gave her the medal she burst into even more tears and kept saying ""I thought you guys would be gone!!""). It was literally my last medal. That was actually the high point of the day for me, being there to give my last medal to that last girl.

Anybody who is in a position who can't run a marathon but wants to participate, I really REALLY recommend volunteering. (some of you may remember my other posts about my knee woes. I am back to slow gentle 5K's, yay, but marathons are out of reach for me, but it turns out volunteering is also awesome.) There were people next to me in the volunteer line at medals who have been volunteering THIRTY years. It turns out there is this whole community of race volunteers, and they are awesome people. It can be a really rewarding way to participate.

Anyway, congrats and respect to the 7:50pm girl, wherever she is, for toughing it out to the end. 

edit: I should point out this was the last runner *that we could find* before the whole block was shut down at 8pm and we were finally forced off course. There were probably some even later stragglers, but we realized we wouldn't be able to find them after that, since the cops were getting serious about kicking everybody out for disassembly of the grandstand and media bridge. Also the race director runs the whole course on his own in the evening. Though of course, he has a different start time than everybody else! :)",running

387,1572294148.0,"Running, fitness and flexibility, observations of an aging (70+) runner.","I have always been into fitness and I plan to continue for another 10-20 years. I run, bike, lift and do yoga but mostly I consider myself a runner.  I have been running for over 40 years and participating in road races from 5Ks to Marathons for about 35 years and I have learned a bit about life and running during that time.  I am not a physiologically gifted runner, spending most of my time (based on extreme effort) at the backend of the lead group or front of the middle group depending on the race.  However, in the past 10 years I suddenly find myself consistently winning or placing in my age group.  I think I can tell you why.

First let me state that the information to follow is based on life experience only. I am not a coach nor do I have any particular training.  I've simply lived for a fairly long time and am still running and competing (which by itself says something). So take what I say with a grain of salt until you can prove it to yourself.

I started taking yoga classes in my mid 50s because, after 20 years of running and moderate lifting I found myself to be extremely inflexible. I did the usual pre and post run stretch's (to a limited degree) so I was surprised to find how stiff I was. I could not sit up straight with my legs out in front of me unless I was against a wall.  So yoga seemed like a possible remedy.  Despite being what I would call very fit, the first few classes kicked my butt.  I stuck with it however and, after several months, learned to accept it.  Although progress seemed non existent, the classes started to feel easier.  A year or so later I suddenly noticed some progress. I also started liking yoga even more.  After several years of classes and a moderate increase in flexibility I started a daily home practice.  The more yoga I did, the better I felt. I soon incorporated yin yoga poses into my practice and really progressed from that point (yin poses are passive, you hold the pose for 3-5 minutes and allow gravity to assist you into the pose).

The real secret to the improvement at that point is that yin yoga stretches connective tissue, not just muscle. Why is that important?  In the book  ""The elements of effort"" John Jerome notes that ""If muscle is the engine, connective tissue is the transmission, differential, suspension system, wheels and tires, the means of getting power to the road.""  Most of the stretches runners do may help loosen the muscle a little but do nothing for the connective tissue that Mr. Jerome feels is so important.

There are many aspects of aging that cannot be avoided. You will lose muscle mass and your maximum heart rate will decrease (reducing the amount of oxygen you can send to those muscles). As a result you will get slower, hills will get steeper and miles will seem longer. The one factor you can control to some degree is stride length and that will depend on your flexibility. I have been able to maintain my stride length while others have not so I am suddenly winning in my age division, not because I am faster but because lack of flexibility is making others slower.

So what is my point?  If you are in or approaching your 50s, start stretching now (if you are in your 20s so much the better). Find a good stretching program and stick with it. I do suggest you try yoga but it does not work for everyone so find out what works for you. Make stretching an integral part of your overall fitness program, over time you will learn to love the result.

In short, true fitness requires flexibility and flexibility makes it so much easier to stay active and fit.

Sorry this is so long. Good luck, take care and I'll see you on the roads. Stay active, Stay fit, Keep running!",running

389,1609022438.0,"Just my cross country story, just finished my fourth season of xc in high school and I won’t be running with a college team.","I don’t know who’s gonna read this, but about a month ago my last cross country race happened. I knew cross country was my first sport in high school, and I fell in love with it. It was actually my first organized sport ever, so it was all the more meaningful.

I joined cross country because my school didn’t cut from the team, meaning i could just join. I made some of my best friends in high school there during that team, and made lots of memories that some people forgot but I never really did. I wasn’t amazing either, but I did manage a 7:30 mile at the end of the season. 

My sophomore year, I took it a whole lot more seriously. I ended up skipping indoor freshman year, but outdoor was the season I really committed. My sophomore xc season was probably one of the most fun ones, as I improved drastically and even scored at the sophomore level. It was here that I realized this was my sport, along with indoor and outdoor track, for all of high school. 

My junior year, this was when I performed my best. Making the JV A team, I crushed the hills at Van Cortland and honestly enjoyed it. It was then that I realized I had big goals for the rest of my time, since I was halfway through high school. Goals in my events, from the 400 - mile. I ended with a 5:30 mile. 

My senior year, which the season just finished, was bittersweet. I wasn’t hitting my times from last year, and I missed my season finale due to a quarantine because of exposure. But in my last race, before my quarantine, I gave it my all and then some. I’m proud to have run for my team, and I’m putting in that work for indoor. Even though I won’t be running with a team, I know I gave my all in the end. 

Well, if you’re still here, thank you. This has probably been the most important thing to me in all of high school, as it was something I could work towards for the whole time here. And here I am, training my way to my next indoor race, hoping to go sub 5 in the mile in January. Thanks again.

Edit: Thank you all for the awards and comments! I wanted to tell my story because it's very meaningful to me, and I'm glad I was able to encourage you guys in your running lives. I'll do my best to respond to everyone, no idea this would blow up this much! God bless y'all.",running
390,1573661824.0,Shout-out to all the Significant Others for the support when the alarm goes off at 4 AM (or any other ungodly hour) to help you get through the run!,"I’ve been running for almost a year now and I face the problem most of you probably face. I live in a congested city and running after work is very dangerous, heavy traffic with people eager to get home makes conditions unfavorable for running. After my second 5K after work I was almost ran over by a guy texting and driving on an intersection that I’ve moved my runs to the early hours of the day. How early? 4 AM.

Waking up at 4 AM is HARD. Even when I go to bed early, every time the alarm goes off it literally feels like someone just punched me in the face. So every morning that the alarm goes off at 4 am and my fiancée notices that I’m struggling she always says something along the lines of “I believe in you”  or “I’m proud of you”. She immediately goes back to a coma but those few words of encouragement help me get out of bed and begin my running routine.

391,1606702870.0,Just ran my second half marathon and improved my time by 19 minutes!,"After gaining some weight during the first 4 months of this year, I decided to get back into running. I hadn't ran any further than a 10k in the past so I decided to plan for the next step: half marathon. 

So, this summer I began Hal Higdon's novice half marathon training program with the intent of running the race in mid-August. I don't know why this redhead didn't realize how difficult long distance running was going to be in Iowa during the summer, but I powered through! However, I didn't adhere to the program 100%... I took two weeks off while I moved to Des Moines, and instead of simply pausing the program, I picked up at where I would have been if I hadn't paused. Looking back, this was a mistake... I still ran the race at 2 hours and 10 minutes, but the last 5 miles were really tough. If I was just running on my own and not racing, I probably would have stopped. It took about a week for my legs to not feel sore again.

After taking a couple weeks off post-race, I decided that I wanted to do another half marathon before it got too cold. Because I got busier once the school year started, I decided to do Higdon's H3 program since it only involves running 3 times a week. This fall's training was much easier because 1) I added in some strength training, 2) I was losing weight by following strict CICO, 3) stopped becoming a carbophobe, and 4) actually followed the program to a T.

End result: On Thanksgiving morning, I finished with a time of 1 hour and 51 minutes. It was a much easier run overall and my legs recovered within a couple days. I also lost about 14 pounds this fall thanks to all the running, strength training, and calorie reduction.

Next step: marathon! Not exactly sure which one yet, but I can't wait to continue training and improving. As a teacher, this school year has been extremely stressful for obvious reasons but exercise, particularly running, has been such a huge stress reliever.

Cheers!",running

394,1629033978.0,Running to overcome depression.,"Been a lurker here for a while. I started running back in 2019 after the worst year of my life. Since then, I’ve slowly built up to where I am now. I run between 8-9 miles five days a week at my own pace. Very rarely do I check or compare times. That aspect of running was never important to me.

What is important to me has been running’s impact on my mental health.
I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for a long, long time. Running is one of the few things that gets my brain firing “the good stuff.” After a recommendation from my therapist, I’ve spent the last four months with a psychiatrist cycling through endless ADHD, anxiety, and depression meds which is absolutely terrible and hasn’t helped me at all.

As grueling and sweaty as my morning runs can be in the humid hell of the southeast US, I’d take them any day over any prescriptions.

399,1621690243.0,The worst smell I have ever encountered on a run...,"Last Wednesday, a childhood friend and I ran a half marathon which we mapped out ourselves. We've been training together virtually as she lives in a different state, and this was her first half, so it was a really fun and exciting run! 

We began our run on a bike trail where we ran for about a half mile before turning up a little path that brought us to the road. As we were trotting along, this horrible smell wafted towards us that was so pungent it almost made me gag. My friend said that there must be something dead really near us, but I though it must've been some kind of sewage thing because of the distance along which we could smell it. 

A circle through a neighborhood brought us back to the wretched smell and this time my friend, who is much more fearless than I, said that if we weren't running, she'd totally stop to find out what the dead thing was. 

Fast forward to yesterday: I was at work discussing my race with my boss and my coworker when I mentioned I'd chosen that particular bike trail and neighborhood because of how safe and pretty it is. My boss promptly responds that apparently someone just discovered a very decomposed dead body in that area on Sunday. 

Turns out that our half marathon route took us right past a crime scene, probably no more than 10 feet from this dead body. So, now I know what a dead body smells like for next time I guess? 

I'm a little terrified! We can't find any information on the cause of death, just a confirmation of where the body was found a pretty close description of the location from comments on the neighborhood Facebook page.

400,1557088132.0,I ran a half with my kid today and was emotionally overcome at the end. It was awesome.,"My son turned 18 this year and is graduating from high school in the next two weeks.  He is an incredible ice hockey goalie, all around athlete and has a huge heart.  The boy won't quit.

He has run a bunch of 5k races and has actually finished top ten a few times.  He often places in his age division for 5ks and has even won a few ""Clydesdale"" titles.  (Over 220 pounds.)  He ran the Flying Pig Relay with me and a few friends last year and insisted on running the half with me this year. 

I reluctantly signed him up knowing that he does not have the kind of time it takes to fully train, and I was worried as hell that he'd crash out this morning.  I had decided that I was going to run with him and forgo any PR attempt or place in my division.  Today was all about supporting my kid and enjoying the race.

We talked about his strategy on the way downtown and he had decided that he wanted to finish in about 2:20.  I told him that even though this wasn't totally unreasonable he should just relax and enjoy the race.  He had never been in a race with that many people and was clearly nervous at the start.  After we took off he was going WAY too fast and I had to remind him that we had a long way to go.

We cruised and he ran so strong.  Up those horrible hills from mile 6 to about mile 8.  As we turned away from the full course, his high school band was on the side of the road cheering for him with their drum line.  The whole band was shouting for him and he lit up light a Christmas tree.  It was exactly what he needed.  He was starting to suffer from not training hard enough and this gave him the little push to the finish.

He started to suffer hip and calf cramps and other fatigue-related issues and with less than 2 miles to go, he finally had to stop to stretch out his calves and hips.  We walked through the last three water stops and then rounded the corner to the finish line.  He dug down and ran hard for the last few hundred yards.  I made sure to stutter step right before the finish line to allow him to beat the old man.  He turned to me right at the line and threw his huge arms around me and whispered in my ear ""Thank you dad, I love you.""

404,1592858641.0,Brother-in-law might have done the single most impressive thing I’ve ever seen: a Barefoot marathon with NO training.,"To be honest, I’m still kind of speechless, but after two days it’s time to share this feet feat. 

My brother in law (Amos) is an athletic dude, with a fun-loving personality and a never-tell-me-something-can’t-be-done attitude. That’s why, when my wife and I were figuring out the logistics for running Grandma’s Marathon Virtually (Duluth, MN) he wanted to try and join. We decided to run at our cabin in central Minnesota, where my family would be to help us with fuel breaks. 

He is a huge advocate of being barefoot, which isn’t all that odd, especially since he doesn’t normally do long distance runs but more of backyard sports and in past years he’s done a few jogs for a mile or so in the grass next to the bike trail with us. He loves walking his dog and newborn barefoot on the pavement though, so his feet are somewhat used to it, I guess? 

He has a can do attitude and listens to his own body to tell him what he can and can’t do. He said he wanted to try, and while I was confident he had the mentality and athleticism to do it, my main worry knowing him and knowing distance running was more on the joints and ligaments/tendons that he would have little experience with the wear and tear of a long run... especially hours on pavement. I said I would love him to join and figured that worse case scenario he could tap out at any time and still have done something very impressive! 

Well, he finished. And in 4:51 I believe (I can verify and edit with his exact time when I post). And while YES, he aches like he never has, and his feet do have some blisters and bruising, so far after two days it looks nothing like other photos and videos that we’ve seen from barefoot marathoners. I can try and put some pictures in the comments if you would like.

We are super proud of him, a little annoyed that yes, a brother-in-law can one-up (two up?) us and do this barefoot, cold turkey where as we trained for months... but running is about your own body and mind and your own goals. 

He is an amazing guy, and did an amazing feet feat. He says he’s proud and happy he did it, and while he wouldn’t recommend it to anyone else, he DOES recommend pushing yourselves beyond what others have done or what you yourself have done. We hope to get this all in a video soon, so stay tuned! We are also in contact with Grandmas Marathon about maybe letting me surprise him with an official medal and T-shirt, but that’s if they will allow it to count!",running
405,1593298747.0,"Finally succeeded in a comfortable, pain free 5k, you guys are amazing!","I started my running journey in early April a couple weeks after lockdown started. I had tried to get into running before, gave up thinking I was just 'not built for it'. Really I was just naive, unknowledgeable and knew nothing about what I was doing.

I started out in April making the same mistakes, still didn't know anything. Ended up with some bad IT band problems, knee pain and hip flexor pain. Thought.. Oh no. So I dived into doing research, what to do, how to run correctly, pacing, learning about overstriding, watching countless videos about running form, form analysis.

I took a couple weeks off and started fresh using couch to 5k. 3 weeks in, no knee pain but my hip flexors were still playing up. After being sulky and allowing myself to mope, I upped my physio, upped my discipline and forced myself to integrate a thorough pre and post run routine in the hopes it would help, as well as started going on long walks. I carried on with interval training, got some tips from you guys and kept pushing through even on bad runs. At times the last few weeks I have felt like my body will never feel strong enough, I'll never feel fit enough and will never achieve my long term goals (longer distance trail runs - not ultra marathons lol but I absolutely love trail running but atm am stuck to mostly road running).

Come to today.. Had a crap day.. Thought eh, maybe I should go on a run and see if that helps. Started out, slow comfortable pace with some chilled music, 10 mins goes by, then 20, then before I know it I am almost at 5k, barely feeling tired!! Had such a nice evening run, hips hardly hurt, smiled the whole way through and I got my 5k in at 35 minutes without stopping once.

I am so happy and proud and excited that my patience and discipline are finally starting to pay off. Its not the fastest 5k in the world but it is pain free and that is all that matters. 

I don't run for the stats I run because i enjoy it and I love knowing I am doing and sticking to something that makes me feel good (mentally and physically). Plus the community is super helpful and supportive too😊

Just thought I would share, as I posted the other week asking for advice due to feeling disheartened about my slow progress and hip troubles and here we are now!

Edit: wooah woke up to all these messages!! You guys are amazing Thankyou so much for all the kindness and support you've shown!

Edit 2: I've had a lot of people ask what I do for my hip problems. I am not a physio so please consult one etc for your issues as soon as you can as we are all different.. That being said my routine is:

Pre run: 15 reps of: lunges on each leg, ass to grass squats (banded or non banded), any sort of glute activation exercise tbh maybe some donkey kicks or some banded glute bridges, leg swings front and back and side to side, hip openers, warm up walk.

Post run: cool down walk, then i have 2 main exercises - banded clams and banded side leg raises with foot inverted to the ground whilst doing it to target outer hip/glute. 3 sets of 10-15 reps of those. Then some deep lunges, general stretches, maybe use a foam roller or a tennis ball with a dumbell to 'release' hip flexor, and I use my yoga strap too.",running

410,1632900882.0,Suicide watch while running,"Hubby and I are regular 5-10km runners. Years ago I was running and a women came bolting out of her house into the road. She was crying and said she wanted to end it all. I sat with her until a friend came. Last night, hubby was out running and a similar thing happened to him- young man walking at a pace called out to him to say he’s feeling suicidal. Hubby spoke to him, called me and I was about to call an ambulance/CATT team..and then hubby took him to his address and a professional carer was there and was very concerned about him and took him inside. 
Long story short, if you run a lot, there’s a good chance you run past that distressed person, that person on the bridge, that person near the railway track. It’s worth checking out mental health safety and have an idea of what to do in such an emergency and local phone numbers.. (eg stay calm, listen and validate all feelings, ask if they’ve had help with these feelings before, ask for contacts, speak of supports and pathways to assist, and, as hubby assertively and kindly said ‘well, you’re not doing that on my watch friend’.

I track my time, distance, heart rate etc. but still when someone asks “are you a runner” I respond with “I run, but I’m not a runner”. YES I AM! 

I’ve always had this idea of what a runner should be, how they should look, and perform and I’ve never felt comfortable or worthy of putting myself in that category. Bullsh*t, because I AM A RUNNER! I put one foot in front of the other. Sometimes it’s slow and sometimes it’s fast. Sometimes it’s for miles and miles other times it’s just a mile, but I’m doing it. I find solace and peace in the simple repetition. I release my anger and frustration. I feel gratitude for what my body has done and given me and a desire to push for more, not because someone else is telling me to, but because I want to. It’s a therapy for me, because I am a runner. 

To everyone out there that questions if they are a runner or is feeling down or unworthy. You are a runner. It doesn’t matter if it’s 100% running or 20% running and 80% walking you’re a runner. You’re doing it. Your are amazing. 

Yes, let’s all aim to get better, but while doing so take the time to celebrate what you’ve done. Everyone here has accomplished something amazing - you’re taking the time to show up for yourself and that deserves to be celebrated because we are all runners 🏃🏼‍♀️ 🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏼🏃🏿🏃‍♂️",running
412,1621798916.0,Had BY FAR my best run ever this morning in every way and it was great - just wanted to share a positive running experience with this fantastic community.,"So I've been running for around 9 months and I absolutely love it! Before I started running, I couldn't see the appeal at all - but now I totally get it.

I've been very fortunate to have enjoyed what I consider to be pretty substantial progress over the last 9 months. I started off running 2-3k... Worked up to 5k.... Then up to 7.5k.... then 10k etc. About 2 months ago I signed up for my first half marathon (June 20th) and have been gradually upping my distances since.

This morning I ran 18k in 1hr 30 with an average pace of 5:01 /km. It felt amazing. I think it may have been my first experience of what they call ""runners high"". Around the 12k mark I was able to increase my pace (which I've never been able to do before at that point in a run). I just felt completely in control the entire time, and have been buzzing about it since. 

No real reason why I'm posting this, other than to share my positive experience of running!

I thought that these things were just for really *good* runners, not people like me working on Couch to 5K.

Fast forward a few months, I happened to see a hydration vest for sale ($30!) and my partner convinced me to get it. OH MY GOD! IT'S *WONDERFUL!* I can stay hydrated AND keep my phone, pepper spray, and keys in the shoulder straps!!!!

Upshot- Don't be intimidated to get a piece of cheat ""professional"" gear that will help with your run. Get the $20 bluetooth earbuds and ditch the corded one you've been wrestling! The ""lame"" wrist sweatband, just order it.

It seems to me that all measure of health and fitness nowadays lies in context of muscle mass and muscle growth. I really don't think I'm exaggerating here. I've encountered tonnes of gym-goers that look down on runners or people that only practice cardio-based exercise.

Sorry this got so long.

Edit: I mislabeled the potential surgery as PCL, I'll ask my doctor what the name of the procedure is. Definitely getting another opinion. Thanks for all the kind words, advice, and recommendations. I did not expect such amazing support from a rant post but you guys are truly amazing. I'm trying to reply to everyone so apologies if I haven't gotten back to you yet.

I'm really upset and nobody else seems to really care since I now have a ""perfect excuse"" not to run cause isn't running just so awful? /s For reference, I'm 24F, 5'7"", 118lbs, great diet, and have had an active lifestyle for most of my life.

Basically two months ago I went to a sports medicine doctor for what I suspected and turned out to be patellafemoral pain syndrome (runner's knee), was given physical therapy exercises plus a recommendation for orthotics and a month off of running. I did what I was told, an MRI came back clean, and I was given the all clear to slowly start running again. I did a few light runs, moved states for school, took a few more weeks off, then decided to do a hike in the mountains to get my cardio back up since it had been a while. Uphill was fine, downhill was so painful that I was nearly in tears by the end of the hike, my knee hurt so bad, and I am not a crier. After a week of sharp pain and limping around, I saw a different orthopedic doctor who looked at the MRI results from last time, took X-rays, checked out my legs pretty extensively, analyzed my feet and gait, and concluded that my knees just aren't built to handle strain and impact. The dude even recommended I get checked out for freaking rheumatoid arthritis, told me to take turmeric supplements and glucosamine, and even still, there's even a chance I'll need major surgery on my knee to bring things into alignment in the next few years if the problem persists. I pushed to see if maybe some combination of treatment could get my knees back to a point where running was an option and my doctor kind of just grimaced and said ""I mean, you can do whatever you want"" so apparently it's that bad.

I'm just super sad and upset about the whole thing. I had just gotten back into running after a few lazy and depressed years. It was helping my depression, I was making noticeable progress for the first time ever, it stopped being painful and was really relaxing and enjoyable. I was finally getting the hang of it. I had just bought more running shorts, a long overdue new pair of shoes, and got a gorgeous Garmin forerunner 645 music for Christmas. I was excited to be a runner again. My 83 year old grandfather still runs three days a week and I had wanted to be like him when I got older. I loved it, but now I'm being told that if I want my knees to last, I can't run or do any other impact sports/activities, so no running, no team sports, maybe even no more mountains (I'm from Boulder/Utah so that's a daunting one). I'm basically limited to biking, swimming, and elliptical for cardio (I loathe swimming). I hate the idea that I will always have to rely on equipment and/or a gym membership for cardio, but more than anything else, I'm angry that at only 24, my own body is a such a huge limitation and it's only going to get worse with time.

I don't know what I'm really looking for here, it's just that nobody else seems to like running enough to understand why this is such a blow to me. I'm in the process of rehoming my running watch and for some reason that has me crying while texting people to see if they might appreciate and use it like I did. Anyhow guys, thanks for reading and take care of your bodies and see your doctors before things get bad.

I initially received over 1,000 requests for training plans which is clearly not feasible, so I have been creating customizable training plans over the past few weeks. I have previously posted beginner (first step) running plans, 1 mile running plans, and 5k running plans.

I have now added 10k beginner, intermediate, and advanced training plans. All plans can be found available for download at the following:

You just download a copy of the plan you want from the Google Drive and input your current fitness- which will let you know what paces to run on your workout days. I have included an FAQ section to the 10k plans (and will eventually add that to all plans). The advanced plans aren't elite level as I figure most elites already have a rough idea what they're doing.

I will try and get the HM plans done tonight and uploaded (will edit this post), but it's Easter Weekend so it may have to be put on hold.

I would love to hear any feedback - either comment here, DM, or email me at [freerunningplans@gmail.com](mailto:freerunningplans@gmail.com). I am VERY responsive. If you have your own plan and just want advice, let me know and I'm happy to help out.

Similarly, if any coaches want to contribute plans, routines, I would love to hear from you. I will never claim to be the worlds best runner or coach and I'm continually looking to learn and chat/discuss training methods - especially ones that can be offered to the masses for free. 

I am happy to answer any questions at all regarding the plans, training, or anything else!

I also recently made a post regarding a subreddit virtual race and there was a lot of interest. I would love some help to organize this, or someone take the reins and make it happen in the next 6-8 weeks or so.

I got a heartratemonitor (watch), slowed all my runs down to what felt like agonizingly slow and gradually built up my weekly distance and my pace while keeping my HR and perceived exertion as my guideline, only sprinkling in a fast workout every so often. 

fast forward to today, where I ""accidentally"" ran a sub 2h half marathon while on my long run with a friend. we run a 6km loop and had a great conversation going - so that I decided to run a 4th one and ended up with 23km in 2:08, which is \~1:57 for 21.1km.

423,1603216549.0,BPM playlists for people who like to run with music,"So, I've been maintaining a running cadence playlist (174-180bpm) on Spotify for myself for years now.

I've just finished re-organizing all of them in order of ascending BPM, with a greyed-out silent track separating each section. I run on shuffle, but thought it might be useful for others.

They're mostly a mix of good-energy indie rock, modern alternative, old-school lyricist rap and some pop. All approachable everyday music (imo), nothing too sleepy or aggro, but hopefully also not boring. I tested each song by hand with a tapping app to make sure the BPM was correct.

426,1570667239.0,"Since the moment I was able to walk I remember hating running. Nearly 30 years later, I found out why. Today I went for my first real run.","I just had an amazing experience and needed to share it with someone. Since it involves running, I thought this would be a good place. If this kind of post isn't for r/running, I understand!

First, I think y'all might need some background.

Ever since I can remember, I've hated running. As a kid I was super active, except I hated running. Which was weird, because I always wanted to run. I desired to experience the runner's high my friends talked about, to be able to move fast and free, but I hated doing it. The reason was the constant pain in my chest I'd get whenever I ran. That pain was always lowkey there whenever I was active, but it was unbearable when running. I wanted to run, but the pain stopped me. I'm sure many of you are immediately thinking ""Well that's not normal"". And as a kid, I realized it wasn't either. So my mom took me to a doctor (who was a shitty doctor), who took one glance at this skinny little 11 year old and told me that meant I was ""out of shape"" and just needed to exercise more.

Nearly 18 years of a relatively inactive lifestyle later, I hit a point in my life where I realized if I didn't start being active now, I was probably going to face some serious health issues down the line. So I decided to make a change and started a workout routine. I told myself I'd finally ""get in shape"" and pushed past the chest discomfort starting out, because I *knew* it would go away when I finally hit that miraculous ""in shape"", whatever that was.

It wasn't until 4 months into working out 5 times a week, still facing that same chest pain, that I mentioned my frustration with it to a friend. She looked at me like I was crazy. She told me that was 100% not normal, even if you were out of shape. She convinced me I needed to tell my doctor (a good one this time). I went. I explained to my doctor my pain while running. I explained how when it was really cold I couldn't go outside without something over my mouth because I could feel my lungs. I explained how I could be more active in places that weren't as dry. I explained how my workouts were frustrating because my lungs seemed to tap out before my muscles did. And the more I explained, the more I realized, wow, I have a lot of breathing problems I never thought about.

It took her a *second* to diagnose me. After 29 years, I found out I had asthma, and I've had it all my life. I walked out with a prescription for an albuterol inhaler and a referral to an asthma doctor. Two days later the tests confirmed it. All these years, all this blaming myself for not being ""in shape"", for not trying hard enough, and none of it was my fault. It was because I literally couldn't breathe. Because I had asthma. Because I *have* asthma.

It was when that realization hit me that I made my decision. I was going to learn how to run.

This evening, 29 years after learning how to walk, 28 years after learning I hated running, and 3 months after I was diagnosed with asthma, I went on my first run. And it was *exhilarating*. I've never felt so free. It was addicting. I couldn't run very far at once, I had to do it in intervals with walking in between, but this time the only thing stopping me was my stamina, because this time there was no pain. And I plan to reach a point where my stamina won't stop me either, because all it took was a minute to hook me.

So this is the exciting experience I wanted to share with people. I was able to run tonight for the first time in my life without pain, and I learned something about myself while doing it. I learned tonight, after almost 30 years of evidence proving the contrary, that I've been wrong all these years. I love running, and I can't wait to go again.

There's a lot I need to do before I can make it a real habit. I need a new pair of shoes, I need some cold weather gear to protect my lungs when it gets cold out, I need some reflective gear for dark mornings because my neighborhood doesn't have sidewalks. And of course, I need to actually learn how to run properly to make it sustainable and to practice. But I'm going to do it all, because I love it guys. I love running.

\[edit\] Since the topic of parents not listening to kids has come up a few times in the comments (understandably! I didn't really go into it in my post), I want to clarify that my mom *did* listen to me. It's just that my mom was raised in a strict household where she faced abuse for questioning or second guessing authority figures. There were times when I was kid though where she ""went behind the back"" of my pediatrician and got me into see specialists anyway, which I absolutely love her for, because it saved me from a lot of struggle with my other health issues. She did this even though doing so went against every fiber of her being because she is a wonderful mother who loves her children and does everything she can to help us. She's since dealt with a lot of her childhood issues and is now a strong woman who won't take any shit from anyone, and I don't blame her for me not getting diagnosed, because *she* listened and acted to the best of her abilities.

But today I ran 3 miles nonstop! I feel amazing. I seriously can’t describe it. I know this is such a small accomplishment in the grand scheme of things, but even in high school, the best shape of my life, I couldn’t run 3 miles nonstop.

First recorded run: 3.02 miles, 13’24” pace, 40:32 time. Multiple stops and walks.

40 miles later....

Last recorded run (today): 3.02 miles, 9’58” pace, 30:09 time. No stops or walks.

Note: the times were taken from the Nike Run Club app. Some of the times are a bit off, but that’s from having to stop, get my phone adjusted, and actually set the timer off. The app recorded me at under 10 minutes, okay. I’m taking it!!!",running
428,1608405105.0,Investing in good cold weather gear completely changed running in the winter for me,"When I was a runner in high school, I had the foolhardy attitude that I didn't need fancy gear to deal with bad weather. I stupidly thought that I could impress my teammates by toughing it out with minimal gear. I've always thought that I hated running in the cold because I spent a few awful months running outside in frigid weather wearing inadequate clothing. 

Now that I'm older, wiser, and fatter, I decided that I didn't have anything to prove by ""sucking it up"": I bought some nice thermal compression shirts, some moisture-wicking gloves and hats, some long socks, and a warm pair of exercise pants. Surprising to no one, this has made a **massive** difference in my comfort and performance when running in the cold. I actually look forward to it, and prefer cold weather to running in the summer! I still avoid running in sub 20 degree weather (maybe this is the year I'll brave it), but investing a bit of money has completely transformed how I feel about running in the cold.  

If you're like me, and have spent too much time freezing your butt off outside in order to save a few bucks or prove that you're tough, treat yourself with some moisture-wicking thermal clothing. It's worth it.",running

Does anyone else feel the same?","I often don’t want to get out of bed in the morning. I have difficulty sleeping well and feel exhausted when I wake up in the morning. It takes a lot out of me some days to put on my running shoes and get out the door. I dread every run. I know it fucking kills me. Most days I really struggle through a run, have to push through it, tell myself continuously to keep going. It’s hard. It’s really fucking hard and painful and I sometimes just don’t know why I do it.

But when I’m done, I usually feel good about myself. I get home and shower and get shit done. I’m not as negative about life in days when I run in the morning. I don’t lose hope in things as quickly, or at all. I ponder things through more, rather than get antsy and impulsive. I stay more in control of my emotions. I’m more positive and hopeful and believe in myself more.

All in all, when I run, things don’t feel as fucking bleak as they did today, when I decided to sleep in.

I have one new injury that is healing up nicely, and a knee injury that is likely here to stay on a low key level (had it about 10 years - I think it's a torn meniscus I do not know).

At the same time don't give up completely. I have gotten into Eeyore moods where I think ""well if I can't run perfectly or can only run a mile right now screw it"". Once that disappointment passes you can always find active ways to recover.

Do what you can, listen to your body, and really pay attention to those rough spots that always seem to take their time to heal. I am lucky because I can cycle and sometimes hike without aggravating my injuries so always good to have an alternative. 

I guess ultimately what I'm saying is go easy. You don't want an injury what would likely heal within a few weeks wind up being something you'll be dealing with for longer or even the rest of your life due to impatience.

433,1610367854.0,"On ""comfortable conversational pace"" for beginners","I felt this needed highlighting. A lot of people starting out get the advice (which is good in itself) about going at a pace where they can comfortably hold a conversation.   
There is nothing wrong with this advice but it doesn't always apply. When you're starting out from a *really* sedentary, possibly obese starting point even that pace might not exist yet, or exist for such a small number of steps that you don't notice it. 

I walked about 5 miles a day for about 6 months to drag myself out of obesity before I started running and even then it took quite a lot of walk/runs where the mere act of going into the lightest jog I could manage (only a tiny bit faster than walking pace) would make me a breathless wreck. Running at any speed is a different thing to walking and I found that while I could happily walk for hours running was *hard*. (a lot of other systems come into play when you're jogging that don't when you're walking - the impact goes through the roof and a lot of muscles are called on to support you that might not be expecting it. Little muscles working hard can still make you tired)  
If you're one of those people, don't worry. It will pass. Just keep going. Walk/jog as much as you need to. Keep it as light as you need to and minimize the horrible. If you don't you won't want to go out again next time. You've got the rest of your life. There is no hurry.

435,1686229712.0,Please don't run in poor AQI days,"I've seen like twenty comment threads about this so I just wanted to share my opinion for East Coasters who are experiencing wildfire smoke for what might be the first time:

Don't run in it! Stay home as much as possible. If you have to go outside, wear an n95. I personally don't run over 100 but certainly over 150 is a poor idea for anyone who cares about their lungs (ie, runners). The fine particulates in wildfire smoke aren't just ""smoke"" like a campground fire -- they are tiny particles of ANYTHING burned by wildfires. If you wouldn't run through a cloud of ash from a demolished old building filled with asbestos, you shouldn't run in high AQI. Exercising in moderate and unhealthy AQI actually increases your risk of cardiovascular disease in the long term. 

You have one set of lungs, and they cannot be cleaned or replaced. Anything you put in them today will last much, much longer than any gains you might theoretically get from running.

440,1616622951.0,"The question ""how can you run so much""","Hello! Frequent lurker, first-time poster.

I've been a long-distance runner for quite some time. My current training rotation has me doing around 70 miles/6 days a week. My close family and friends have known this about me. However, as I chat with people in meetings at work, or talk to more distant family or friends who aren't runners, they can't believe anyone would *want* to run that much.

My go-to, laugh-it-off response is, ""haha yeah, it's a fun hobby that keeps me healthy"" and kinda leave it at that. I don't think I've ever really answered the question though.

I'm sure a lot of us get asked. I'm sure a lot of us feel uncomfortable because we feel like we are bragging if we talk about how much we run to non-runners. I'm sure some of us run for reasons we wouldn't want to talk about. But here is my answer, on why I choose to put so much time, effort, exertion, pain, and money into an activity that most people loathe.

To start, I've been a runner all my life. It's been the only thing I feel I have any shred of natural talent at. So mostly, I run because it's just part of my lifestyle, my routine, or whatever you call your day-to-day life of normal activities that you don't really plan; just do. But specifically, why do I run so much?

Well...I'm severely depressed, I'm anxious, I feel as if I skip a day of running I've wasted an entire day and will hate myself. I'm too scared to do drugs; alcohol destroys my stomach; the idea of intentional self-harm (cutting) never really crossed my mind as an option. Basically, most things that would be considered ""normal"" outlets for someone who is mentally ill- for me, is running. I'm sure it's an outlet for a lot of you as well. But, this isn't a socially acceptable answer. ""I run a lot because it's a way for me to constructively cope with my life and world around; and allows me to physically exert a huge amount of anger and hatred, in a way that doesn't harm myself or others"" isn't what people care about or want to hear.

So that's why I run. I'd love to know if other's have similar feelings. Like, do you shy away from a simple, mundane question like that, because the genuine answer really isn't all that peppy and welcoming?

Last note: I do want to add, that this is a fairly personal post for me. If you look through my Reddit history, I'm into tech and stuff. So this is already out of my comfort zone, but I think it's a healthy exercise, and may garner helpful conversation. BUT, I have been seeing a therapist for several years, and we are aware that this is my coping mechanism. After a while, I realized that running alone, wasn't doing it. I was still feeling mentally destroyed after runs, when I would normally have some sense of rejuvenation. There were other, more prevalent indicators than this, but when your coping strategy stops working altogether, you should know it's time for help. If you made it this far, I appreciate you, and have a healthy and safe week!

&#x200B;

**Edit:** I sincerely appreciate everyone sharing their sentiments, experiences, anecdotes, and feedback. I'm glad this was able to spark a little conversation, and maybe be an outlet for some. I'm hugely overwhelmed by the responses; I tried responding to everyone at first, but it got to be too much, so I apologize if I don't get to you. Know that I see you, and I appreciate it.   


My biggest takeaway from this has nothing to do with running, but acknowledging that we are all broken people in one way or another. The journey we took to become broken, our degree of brokenness, and the methods we use to cope and overcome, are vastly different. The one similarity a lot of us share, is running; and in some fashion, it has helped us. I'm deeply moved by the stories some of you shared around this similarity.   


To address a few points: I've been running for nearly 15 years now. Pretty consistently since I was 10. 70 miles a week at this stage feels like a lot, don't get me wrong, but I've just trained enough to do it, and it's taken a really long time with tons of setbacks. Some of my friends that are runners put my numbers to shame; it really all comes down to time, physical well-being, and dedication. At this moment, my time allows me to train the way I do.   


It was mentioned that, ""maybe this is your sign you talk about running too much."" I can assure you, this is far from the case, for me personally. The least amount of attention and conversation I draw to myself, the better. Here is an example of what I mean, when this question can make me feel kinda weird:  


*I work remotely, so I'm in a Zoom meeting with a few colleuges. We do an 'around the room' ice-breaker to get to know each other a bit, and ease the awkwardness. They ask, ""what's one things outside of work you spend the most time doing?"" I say, ""Well I spend quite a bit of time training and running, so probably that."" ""OmG hOw MuCh Do YoU rUn"" ""....like70milesaweekrightnow, can we please move on"" and then the question ensues.* 

Or, sometimes friends that maybe aren't that close, ask genuinely because they are interested. Then I feel weird because I have to decide if I want to be honest or not. I suppose if you can't relate to this, then our mindsets are just different in this regard, and that's great! I'm glad we can't agree on this, and I can see how someone else thinks about something I feel insecure about. 

Lastly, to those that simply said, ""this isn't healthy get help."" 

...lol just read, ya know.",running
441,1531927943.0,The single greatest piece of advice my high school track coach gave me,"When I was in high school, I was distance runner on the track team. I went to a very small school and as a result the track team wasn't very big. However, our distance team (composed of four guys) was really close knit, to point where we still talk every single day. We always ended up running the 4x800m, distance medley relay, and the occasional 4x1600m as a unit. We would almost never win because of the sheer size of the other schools in the area, but there was nothing we loved more than running with each other. 

Sometime in the middle of my senior year, things began to change. Our distance team seemed to be in a slump. We were consistently running slow times and placing much lower than we should have. After one 4x800m, our coach called us all over to talk with him. He was generally a man sho showed no emotion no matter the circumstances, but something was obviously different this time. He had us just stand there for a while without speaking. When he finally spoke all he said was: ""All that your times reflect is that you are feeling sorry for yourselves and there is no place for that in running.""

Our distance team got increasingly better after we heard this from our coach and all we wanted to do was show him that we could be the runners he wanted us to be. We were beating our personal bests every meet and became much better runners. We were even able to place 3rd in our council in the 4x800m upsetting some of the biggest schools in the area and all four of us reaching our goal of going sub-5 in the mile.

I still hold on to what my coach said to this day. Every time that I question why I'm running or want to stop, I just think about feeling sorry for myself has no place in running. As soon as you start feeling sorry for yourself, you have given up. Think about the journey and how much you've worked to get where you are. Even if you're just starting, think about how much mental fortitude it took for you to get up and actually start running. Every runner has experienced or will experience a time when they start to feel sorry for themselves, like they will never get to where they want to be or be like other runners. Whether you're first or last in a race, you can feel like a winner as long as you believe in your talent and never give up.",running

Amenities available to registered participants pre- and post-race in Grant Park, as well as on course will be consistent with what has been historically available race day.  

As in previous years, participants will stage before the race in start waves and wave corrals. This process allows the event to facilitate a controlled mass start, which maintains distancing and manages participant flow on course.   

Friends, family and community members can follow their participants on race day using public transportation. The 26.2-mile course route can be easily navigated using the Chicago Transit Authority’s “El” train. Spectators are encouraged to move along the course throughout the event. 

Additional details about race weekend will be available in the 2021 Bank of America Chicago Marathon Participant Guide. The guide will be published digitally one month before the event.  ",running
443,1581076875.0,It has been 0 days since falling off the treadmill,"Fell off the treadmill at the gym last night.  That’s a first for me.  I’ve been running regularly since 2010, so probably between 500 and 800 treadmill runs in total. My falling to staying upright ratio is great!

And then I fell.

447,1593354044.0,Completed my first 10k,"Hi all kind of new to the subreddit, my running journey probably started around March time, when I started myself on the couch to 5k. As time went on I eventually completed my first 5k in approximately 28 minutes and for the past few weeks have been getting in my 3 5ks a week.

However, over recent weeks I have had a dip in my running quantity, I’m not sure as to where my motivation went but it definitely disappeared. I decided today would be my first run back and I wanted to do a long run for myself, I wanted to reach at minimum 4 miles maybe 5.  

Well low and behold I completed today’s run of 10.87km in 59:43min and at under 9min per mile I can say I’m over the moon with it. I didn’t realise my body had that ability in it.

My friend, however, has been running throughout a good portion of their life. Recently, not so much, but they wanted to get back into it. And I wanted to join, but I was kind of scared. 
Until one night, we both impulsively signed up for the Chicago Half Marathon. I think if I hadn't signed up for it, I would've never started to run consistently. We started training on May 20th and we're now almost exactly 2 weeks in. The first day, I could barely run a quarter of a mile. I was gasping for air. On May 24th, I ran my first mile without stopping. We've been gradually increasing every day.
After one mile, I am usually dead. Like I can barely breathe. I had some issues with my right foot and calf. It would hurt to the point of tears. I realized that I was too stiff and not letting my legs just go. Today, I changed that and ran 2 miles without stopping and I felt absolutely fine. It's not a lot compared to the 13 that I'll be running in September, but I am improving a lot more than I thought I would. We set a sort of training plan and according to that, I should've been running 2 straight by the end of June, but I just did it in the beginning of June.

451,1593719765.0,Being motivated to run every day is easy. Summoning the motivation to do strength exercises is something else...,"While I am happy to wake up at stupid o’clock every morning to go running, I find summoning the motivation to do any strength exercises a huge challenge. This isn’t an energy thing - I’m not too tired to them, I’m just not inspired to even do the bare minimum.

I think it is because running is obviously goal-orientated (ie beating a PB, running x amount of miles etc), whereas the goals of strength exercise (lift more weight/reduce the likelihood of injuries/ have stronger muscles) just don’t grab me in the same way. I know lifting and strength training is good for me but I always end up prioritising running, so strength work gets pushed aside.

Are there any runners out there who can give me some hacks to encourage my goal-obsessed brain into thinking kettlebell/bodyweight exercises aren’t tedious? Or do I just have to accept it is boring and treat this sort of exercise as chore like doing the dishes (ie it can’t be made fun but it is necessary)?

Edit1: Thanks for all your kind words and suggestions - never had over 1k upvotes before! You’ve done a great job to get me pretty pumped up (pun intentional) to do strength training :)

Here’s a quick overview of how to set this up if anyone is interested. For those of you that requested, here’s a video of it in action: [https://streamable.com/y2zo2](https://streamable.com/y2zo2)

**TLDR**: You’ll need a Nintendo Switch, a computer monitor or old TV, and a handful of cables and accessories to bring everything together.

What you’ll need:

* Nintendo Switch: [https://www.target.com/p/nintendo-switch-with-neon-blue-and-neon-red-joy-con/-/A-77464001](https://www.target.com/p/nintendo-switch-with-neon-blue-and-neon-red-joy-con/-/A-77464001) \- if you’re patient and keep an eye on /r/nintendoswitchdeals you can probably grab this for 10-15% off.
* Computer Monitor or Small TV (if you get a TV, be mindful of weight - a heavy TV may not work with a ceiling mount) - lots of choices at Amazon - look for one with at least 1 HDMI (but you might want 2 HDMI, in case you want to plug in a Fire TV stick or Chromecast): [https://smile.amazon.com/s?k=computer+monitor&ref=nb\_sb\_noss\_1](https://smile.amazon.com/s?k=computer+monitor&ref=nb_sb_noss_1)
* Ceiling Monitor Mount - I got this one ([https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U0FCC5Q/](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U0FCC5Q/)) but it looks like there are cheaper ones with good reviews - make sure it’s meant for whatever you’re mounting (TV vs Monitor, size, etc) - if you don't want to put a hole in your ceiling, you might be able to find a standing floor TV mount, but I've never tried it and you'll likely need a pretty tall stand.
* If your monitor does NOT have HDMI, but does have DVI, you’ll need something like this: [https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B014I8UXKG/](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B014I8UXKG/)
* If your monitor **only** has VGA, you can use something like this [https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZMV7RL2/](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZMV7RL2/)  as well as a female to female HDMI coupler like this [https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V7SFR8Y/](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V7SFR8Y/)
* For sound, you’ll likely need a speaker (some monitors have built-in speakers) - I happen to have a JBL Clip 3 [https://smile.amazon.com/JBL-Waterproof-Noise-Canceling-Speakerphone-Refurbished/dp/B07GDV2B7P/](https://smile.amazon.com/JBL-Waterproof-Noise-Canceling-Speakerphone-Refurbished/dp/B07GDV2B7P/) lying around and it works great, but if you don’t have one, something like this [https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0791H74NT/](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0791H74NT/) will probably work - just be aware of the length of your cables and where you’ll want the speakers to be. You’ll need a 3.5mm male to male cable to plug into the headphone jack of the Switch if you’re using speakers that don’t have one. [https://smile.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Stereo-Audio-Cable-Meters/dp/B00NO73Q84/](https://smile.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Stereo-Audio-Cable-Meters/dp/B00NO73Q84/)

Mount the ceiling mount in front of your treadmill (make sure you're hitting a stud), mount the monitor, connect the Switch and speakers, and you're all set!

&#x200B;

The main product that makes this all possible is the Joy-Con ([https://smile.amazon.com/Nintendo-Joy-L-R-Gray-switch/dp/B01N6QKT7H](https://smile.amazon.com/Nintendo-Joy-L-R-Gray-switch/dp/B01N6QKT7H))- for those of you not familiar with the Nintendo Switch, Joy-Cons are two \*separate\* controllers that can be used to play games on the Switch. Since one can be held in each hand and there’s no wire between them, it’s perfect for running on the treadmill. **Joy-Cons come with the Switch, so if you purchase a Switch, you don't have to buy the Joy-Cons separately**.

Note that it is possible to **just** purchase the Joy-Cons and hook it up to a PC or steam link via something like this: [https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07413R4HS/](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07413R4HS/) \- this will allow you to hook up your Joy-Cons to your PC and it’ll appear as a generic game controller.

Games that work really well for running (I’ve played all of these without issue while running):

* Hollow Knight
* Megaman Legacy Collections
* Megaman 11
* Octopath Traveler
* Pokemon Sword & Shield
* The Way
* Shovel Knight
* Final Fantasy 7+

Games that absolutely do not work for running (for me at least):

* Rocket League (this was a good test of my treadmill’s kill switch)
* Diablo 3 (shaking the joy con causes your character to dodge, and you can't disable it)

I also bought a Fire TV stick and hooked it up to the monitor as well - this lets me use my Peloton Digital subscription and turn my cheap treadmill into the $4k+ Peloton Tread.

I don’t want to make this post too long, so if you have specific questions I’d be happy to answer in the comments - hope this helps someone’s treadmill run be a little less awful!",running

460,1634234916.0,Odd experience running today: person followed me wearing jeans and socks while recording me.,"Went on my regular run and noticed that this person, in jeans and socks, started jogging next to me (I had reduced my pace as I was 4 miles in). At first it felt like he was going to another person's house but he kept following me and eventually started recording me. At that point I really thought it was maybe because they thought I didn't live in the neighborhood so that's why he's doing this or just a complete random occurrence. 

I didn't feel comfortable with someone following me that close and without a mask so I came to a stop and asked what's up. He asked the basics (if I live in the neighborhood) and for some odd reason started commenting on my form and how I should take longer strides. Started saying stuff like at my pace it felt like he was walking and when I asked if he has run before, his response was he had done research and could probably beat me in running if I challenged him (don't know why this person was so adamant about saying he's better than me tbh). Then he started talking about I shouldn't wear shoes because the human body was meant to run bare foot.  

At that point I mentioned I needed to get back to running back home and I guess he couldn't hear but he kept following me while mentioning things I should do to run better. Again mind you he was in jeans and running with socks on. Once I came close to my home I stopped again and mentioned to him that don't do this to other people because the outcome could be a lot different and especially to girls but he was completely perplexed by it. Kept saying he had done research and probably knows more than me so I should listen to him. At that point I just peaced out and told him to l eave me alone again for the 3rd time and thankfully he did do it.",running

464,1614753057.0,"I don't know who needs to hear this, but seeing a pelvic floor physical therapist saved my running","By the way, I am a man.  

If you were to spend 15 minutes on google searching ""running"" & ""pelvic floor"", you'd find article after article talking about incontinence - mostly geared towards women. This is an important issue that many runners - mostly women - face. 

But there is another side to this whole pelvic floor thing that is only just starting to get the attention it deserves. That other side is mostly men - often endurance athletes and/or weight lifters - dealing with urinary retention and/or pain associated with going to the bathroom.

Even among urologists (the natural place to seek help for such things) there is little awareness. Most doctors will assume the prostate is the culprit. That means that for men under the age of 50, diagnosis will usually be ""chronic prostatitis"". Its a catch-all bucket for pelvic pain and/or retention issues. 'Chronic Prostatitis' basically means ""well everything seems fine. No infection, no cancer. But clearly something is up, so..."".  In reality, it rarely has anything to do with the prostate at all. 

My own journey included a trip to the ER (when I couldn't pee after a 20 mile training run), 5 days w/ a catheter, weeks on antibiotics and flowmax, a valium prescription, blood tests, ultrasounds, many visits to my Urologist, a crushing DNF on my first marathon, a visit to a pelvic floor therapist who was a terrible fit (overly focused on female-centric pelvic floor issues), and finally a 2nd chance with a different pelvic floor therapist who is awesome.

For months, I had to dial way back on my running. I dealt with a lot of anxiety wondering if another trip to the ER and a week in a catheter was waiting for me at the end of my run. 

Now, thanks to my pelvic floor therapist and a dedicated post-run stretching routine, I am back to my normal running patterns. My anxiety is subsiding. Other minor symptoms that I just put up with and figured were normal are going away. 

So I don't know who needs to hear this, but just please know that its an option out there. Running isn't generally a ""cause"" of this but running a lot of miles is absolutely something that can bring it to the surface and make symptoms worse. 

If you have trouble starting a stream, or any discomfort when urinating, or pain after a bowel movement (often mistakenly assumed to be hemorrhoids), you should see a doctor. Then - depending on what your Dr finds - you might consider a consultation with a pelvic floor physical therapist!

465,1565127245.0,I ran every day for 30 days -- here's what happened,"I have been running very inconsistently for about 10 years -- basically training a few week/months a year for half marathon or 10k, and then barely 1 run a week for the rest of the year (with absolutely no running for sometimes months). 


30 days ago, I decided to change that and force myself into consistency by starting a 30 day run streak!
I chose to target a minimum of 30 minutes and 5k daily.  


Here is what happened:

 
* My VO2max did this: https://imgur.com/BvHXOa8 
This is according to Garmin, so probably not a real VO2max measurement as I don't think it's physiologically possible to improve that much in a matter of days. But still, my VO2Garmin improved nicely from 47 to 52!


* I learned how to run really easy. Zone 2 easy. And I learned to enjoy that. 


* In order to maintain the streak, I had to do mostly shorter easy runs. Before, I felt like it was a waste of time to get ready, go outside, and then only work out for 30 minutes at an easy pace -- I didn't feel like it was an achievement. Now I care less because every run is part of something bigger.


* Towards the end, my calves were really sore (my soleus muscle I think). I experimented with changing my stride and cadence -- taking shorter steps. It was a game changer. I think I was overstriding a lot before. In only a few days, I changed that (bad?) habit. 


* Having that 30-days objective made it easier to go out and run. There was no discussion, no decision to make: I made the decision to run at the beginning of the streak, so I just had to run. 


Hopefully I can keep that good habit and train all year without stopping so much!

I guess the impact is not the same for people who already train a lot in a structured way, but this little experiment was really fun and I look forward to doing it again after a short recovery. Or maybe I'll push to 60 days. I'll see how I feel tomorrow.",running

You may have heard of me when I was a teenager - I made the World Championships at 17 and broke the high school American record for the 1500m. Or maybe you’ve heard of me more recently, when I spoke out about the culture of abuse I experienced as an athlete at the Nike Oregon Project. Today, I’m still a professional runner but I’m also dedicated to using my platform to make the sport a better place for current and future athletes. In 2020, [I joined Tracksmith](https://for-the-love.tracksmith.com/for-the-love-5/) as an athlete and member of their community team, working on projects to support and inspire runners of all levels (sign up for my Fast Times newsletters, [here](https://new.tracksmith.com/pages/newsletters).) My role at Tracksmith is full-time, which is unique for professional athletes. In a new model for sponsorship, my compensation is tied to my overall contributions to the brand, not just my results. I am not subject to reductions and I receive health care and other benefits (this is surprisingly rare in professional running!). 

Inspired by my experience at Tracksmith, I wanted to build a professional team that would offer women athletes an opportunity to train at the highest level while also developing their non-running career and supporting the community. This summer, I launched [Atalanta NYC](https://www.atalantanyc.org/), a New York City based nonprofit with two main goals: We employ and support professional female runners so they can achieve their highest athletic goals, and those same runners serve as core mentors for our youth mentoring program. Atalanta’s program is structured to enable athletes to find a healthy and sustainable balance in their running lives and careers. 

If there’s anything I have learned in the past few years, it’s that each of us has the power to drive change, just by using our voice and speaking up for what’s right. I am passionate about using my platform to make a safer, more equitable sport for all. 
Outside of running, I am a dedicated dog-mom to Nala and love Greek mythology. I’m excited to answer your questions about training, racing and my [favorite Tracksmith gear](https://new.tracksmith.com/).

468,1629988523.0,Ran for the first time since starting chemo for stage 3 breast cancer,"Like the title says, today after months of being mostly bed ridden I had my first real solo run. I was so active before my diagnosis and since then I’ve mostly been limited to walks where my husband is essentially dragging my bald ass while carrying a water for me. 

Also not posting this to brag or have people stroke my ego. Posting this for two reasons. 

1) this gives me so much humility. Being active and going for a run is a privilege that I missed so much for these last few weeks and months where I could barely go a flight or stairs. It’s a simple act that many people in the world are unable to do for a number of reasons. That elusive “runners high” is not so easily afforded to everyone. So next time you are on yours, truly breathe it in. Every run I ever go from now on I will appreciate sooooo much more. 

2) to not even remotely subconsciously judge someone running slow and assuming it’s because they’re out of shape or thinking I’m better because I run faster. Admit it or not it’s something we might have all thought at some point in a run. If not, you’re better than me. This run taught me that if someone is out there trying their best, that is A lot. We never know the struggles they are going through to get through their run. Even if they are running so slow the walkers are passing them (like me) try to keep your thoughts kind. 

Lastly, let me use this opportunity for a PSA. If you are a lady or know of one- sisters, daughters, mothers, aunts, wives or friends over 30 encourage them to go for an ultrasound or mammogram. And if they or you are younger make sure they have the awareness of any changes in their breast and if so don’t ignore them. 

Breast cancer is super curable in most cases and best chances are when it’s caught early. It’s only when it spreads to critical organs that it’s not great news.

470,1603937490.0,"I ran my first 10km run today in over 8 years, in under an hour","Apologies I didn’t know how to flair this. First time posting in this sub! But I feel so good and happy that I wanted to share!

I used to run cross country from grades 3 to 8. In middle school we used to do monthly 5km runs. I would average between 25-30 minutes on these runs depending on the conditions and how I felt. 

At the end of my grade 8 year I challenged myself to do the 10km race in my capital city at the time. I was 13 and clocked a time of 1 hour 6 minutes. I was playing various sports as well at the time so I thought it was a pretty good time. Grade 8 was the last year I was really active as I switched tracks to academics in high school.

8 years later, corona hits. University abruptly ends and I am unemployed. What to do? Start running. My first 4km run was dreadful, it took me 35 minutes with lots of breaks! Eventually I was able to run without stopping, and gradually decreased my time. Then I added another km, hoping to get back to my middle school time of under 30 minutes. It took five months but I did it. 

Since I started running again I also have had 4 surgeries on various toenails which puts me out for a few weeks each time. I just recently started running 5kms again still under 30 minutes. 

Today after an 8.5 hour retail shift I decided to go for a run. Unusual as I usually only run on my days off. But I go and I do my 5km and I’m feeling great. So I do another lap of my neighborhood and ended up running 10km in 58 minutes 59 seconds! I was amazed! Considering I think I was in way better shape 8 years ago, but I am so glad to be running again and setting new personal bests. It took a pandemic for it to happen but I know I will be running for a long time again now.

Edit: first 10k in over 8 years with a time of under an hour, for those being picky about the title. 😑",running

472,1573318408.0,Ran 10 miles for the first time ever. Does anyone else feel like their runner's high... feels like a genuinely psychedelic experience?,"I set out to run my first ten easy miles today with half marathon training group. The first mile or two was stiff. By mile 4, I was feeling scared and lonely because I fell behind my group. 

But by mile 6 I was running straight into the rising sun, it was warming my face, and I did everything I could to stop bawling over how beautiful everything is. The song ""Mother Nature's Son"" by the Beatles was stuck in my head and it was amazing, I wanted to get home and learn how to play it with the same purity and sensitivity that McCartney played it.

By mile 7 I felt deeply connected to humanity in a way I almost never feel. Someone cut in front of me to run faster than me (because I was going hella slow), and I chuckled to myself and thought, ""What a young soul!"" 

By mile 8 as I ran back to where I started I saw all the ugliness and fear in my city, and realized that it's not always safe, and people aren't always nice. Fortunately though I met some friendly construction workers who let me use their Porta Potty. 

Overall it was a good run. As I was driving home I saw a homeless person sleeping on a bench and I started to bawl uncontrollably. I went to the nearest CVS and bought some cozy socks for them, leaving it by them for when they woke up.

But the weird thing is I almost never feel this emotionally awake. I only have felt like that when literally tripping on acid.

474,1623282038.0,Getting harassed while running by semi driver,"Hey everyone I have a problem that I’m sure a lot of other girls can relate to I’m just at a loss of what to do. 

So I run at all hours of the daytime (never alone at night) in busy, populated areas for safety. I’ve just been having so many gross men saying really gross sexual things to me out of their car windows the more weight I lose it’s been happening more and more. I’m just so upset because I can deal with the yelling out the window and stuff even though I don’t like it at all but today something different happened. 

I was running on a boardwalk type area along the beach. There’s lots of restaurants, cars, and people around but it’s all on the opposite side of the road where I’m running on the sidewalk. There’s bike lanes and then two lanes of traffic. So I’m running about to go across a side street in front of me when a man in an ENTIRE semi truck honks and when I don’t give him the attention he obviously wants he pulls on the road I was about to run across to completely block me and trap me so he could talk. I quickly ran around him as fast as I could and he starts screaming out the window at me like “fuck you bitch for not even giving someone the time of day” like can’t he understand that’s scary and weird for a woman??? I’m all by myself and you’re trying to trap me. I know there’s tons of people around but I’ve been followed by people in cars in the middle of the day, they just don’t even care. 

I just cried because I’m so sick of it. And as I’m crying about the semi truck some man leaned all the way out of his car to tell me “I’ve got a fat ass ma”. When I go running with my boyfriend no one says a single thing to me. Only when I’m alone and vulnerable. They obviously respect my boyfriend more than me. I don’t know what to do but it’s pretty sad I feel safer running alone in the woods then on the street and the beach is honestly my favorite place to run. 


I don’t know I guess I’m just wondering what I can do to stay safe? I’m honestly considering trying to dress like a guy and wear a hat and glasses or something because I’m over it.

475,1562524343.0,Running with Strangers?,"So today I was doing another badly paced run along the Hudson River. On the fourth mile I pass a guy going at a fast clip, and turn into one of those pier loopabouts. After a few meters he surges back beside me and starts to pull away. A race! The breath is sucked out of my gut as I follow him, dipping back under 6:10 pace. We trot around the pier and he glances back to see that I’m still there, heaving forward. At the northern swath of Battery Park, I cut diagonally across the grass. I’m gassed and ready to finish my run, but want to cheer him forward. As the guy rounds the walkway that I cut, I give him a grin and a thumbs up. He smiles back, then gestures encouragingly: “Come on!” I hesitate. He waves forward again, and I say screw it and start running again beside him. 

""I'm going to the mall!"" I shout. He hears me through his airpods and nods. The adrenaline kicks in and I run another quarter mile with him, weaving through the crowds at the ferry terminal. All the adrenaline can't make up for my lack of fitness and I ease to a stop once I reach the Brookfield mall plaza. He pauses too and we exchange a few words. He looked to me a bit like runner Shel Silverstein. I told him I wanted to run a bit more but didn't have it after keeping pace with him. He says he's been going a bit slower on runs because of the heat (seriously, heat makes summer running hell), and appreciates the surge I threw at him. He asks if I can do a couple more miles and I regretfully decline. So we bump fists and he goes on his indomitable way past the dock. 

That was it — no names, no background, just two runners who both felt good on a hot summer day. Honestly I wish I could share a mile or two with more of the runners I encounter! Have any of you gone on spontaneous runs with strangers?

478,1636981510.0,"Currently on a 134 day running streak, here is what I’ve learnt so far.","I’d love to share some things I’ve noticed doing a running streak as a way of improving mental health, weight and overall well-being. 

Stats 
- When I started the running streak I weighed 87kg(25yo male) I currently weigh 80.5
- my first week of running I would struggle to get 2km(a little over a mile) my biggest run thus far is 12km
- my cadence naturally increased along with my speed
- currently running 44km a week

I cannot recommend doing this enough. My initial goal was to do 30 days, the first attempt I hurt my foot from not understanding my body and pushing too hard early. The next attempt I took it slow and we are at 134 so far. 
I’ve never really liked running, it’s always been a fear of mine and that’s changed. Although I’d say at least once a week I’m still struggling to get myself to run. I started without any real plan but the run bug bit me, I changed to work towards adding a progression. I’m currently running a marathon(44km) a week which is insane to me considering I couldn’t run up the road before I started. 

Also it could just be my experience but I feel the running helped me make smarter food decisions. Moving away from regular MacDonalds meals to just getting a healthier alternative or cooking. I still eat like a slob so it’s amazing to me the weight I’ve lost and people are noticing it. 

Additional things I’m noticing 

- running with a runners belt is amazing, only took me 100 days to realise running with a phone in my pocket was annoying, lol!

- brooks are the best shoes(for me personally)

- wind sucks

-treadmill now feels harder to me then running outdoors(boring)

-just start the run

-whenever I had a headache or if I was sick and went for a run, I felt better! It is honestly so strange but as soon as I broke a sweat my headache would go

-not once have any of my recurring injuries re-appeared, I’ve had overuse problems for a long time, the power of taking it slow.

-chafe can be a bitch, work out the best shorts to get

-belaga socks stopped me from getting blisters 

-foam roller is my favourite recovery tool

- I feel far more confident and relaxed, my ego has definitely taken a back seat too!

-I’ve had to ditch undies in the most unlucky scenario(no toilets around)

-every time I try to focus on increasing speed at the same time as distance , I get really tight and it’s impatient.

479,1620250095.0,The Low Hanging Fruit of Injury Prevention Part 1: Recovery.,"**Some background to start:**

This will be a weekly run down of some of the real basics to start to nail in terms of preventing injuries. Broadly speaking it’s going to be discussing, week by week:

1. Recovery (Sleep, Food, Stress)
2. Training
3. Strength Training & Mythbusting

**Who this is for:**

This is generalist advice for everyone, however with some bias towards the newer/intermediate runner. Advanced runners should be doing most of this anyway, although it should act as a good reminder. You’ll see throughout that I advocate that you seek professional advice if you’re unsure, and this is really important. I know that there’s always a desire to try to self-diagnose, work with information online, but it’s really critical to realise that you will get masses of conflicting advice/information which will lead to extreme frustration if you are looking to solve a problem. Find a professional you can work with, and work with them if you feel that you can't work in isolation.

**Who this is not for:**

Those with a current acute injury who are looking for advice. Nothing that I’m laying out here will be specific enough for you to take action. Please seek help via a local medical professional if you are struggling with a current acute injury. 

**Who am I?**

In brief, I’m a UK based HCPC registered physiotherapist – I primarily work in acute hospitals/post-hospital rehab (trauma, ITU etc.) but have a special interest in runners and exercise physiology. 

**Why am I writing this?**

I’ve commented on a few threads recently describing my feelings towards certain modalities, and I’ve received (and occasionally still do) PMs from people asking me to flesh out my answers. I thought it would be useful as a community resource to provide a longer read for those who are interested. 

**Working from an available evidence base**

This is important for a multitude of reasons, and I open with it because throughout this post I’ll present some of the evidence base behind certain interventions. There are some that I won’t be able to provide a paper on, however, but I’ll provide the reasoning behind why I would advise doing it. I have also tried to make papers from open access sources where possible. 

**Taking a holistic approach**

We are all only human. As a result, it needs to be made clear early that as you sit there to read this, you have to consider your running (or other athletic endeavour) in the course of you as a whole person. To just assume a running injury is caused solely by biomechanical factors is unfair to yourself, and sometimes that presents a barrier to effective treatment. Your body can only tolerate a certain amount of stress – and the goal really is to limit the amount you are suffering from other (avoidable) sources so that you can run more. Simple. Kinda. 

**The low-hanging fruit approach**

I hope this is an appropriate description for a lot of people. What I mean when I describe something as ‘low hanging fruit’ is that these interventions are something that nearly everyone can integrate into their daily lives without a lot of fuss, pain or expense. In some ways they are also the foundation of us being healthy humans. They do not need to be adhered to as if you are a monk, but a general trend in that direction is important for all sorts of reasons for both mental and physical health.

**What causes injuries?**

I see a lot of people who have lost the wood for the trees in this respect. My feeling, and something I tell my patients over and over again (whatever I’m seeing them for), is that an injury has occurred because you have exceeded the load that the tissue is able to take. This can happen acutely (falling over causing a broken bone) or chronically (inadequate recovery leading to tendinopathy). 

The chronicity aspect is what gets most runners. If you do not recover properly your body suffers from an increasing load each time you go out, thus increasing your risk of developing an injury. 

This concept seems simple enough – but there is an interacting web of factors that contribute to this. Your genetics, gender at birth, past medical history, running age, physical age, work stress, environmental factors, injury history. All of this contributes to what causes your injury, and this is why when someone provides you with injury advice over a forum, they are almost inevitably, while well meaning, wrong.. This is also why I’m providing very general advice here: If you are worried, please see a properly qualified medical professional for appropriate triage, diagnosis and treatment. 
To avoid injury then, we need to make sure that load is appropriate, and that recovery is good enough. How do we go about that?

**Sleep**

How many recovery devices are on the market currently? Or supplements? Everyone is hunting for that ‘hack’ that allows them to feel more recovered, when the best possible thing is to sleep well and more consistently. There are evidenced links between sleep deprivation and injury risk ([here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25028798/)). 

The goal is always to try and increase the amount of sleep that you’re having, and also improving the quality of it. I suggest tracking it somehow, either via a watch or the old pen and paper method. Either approach you use, you should be subjectively asking yourself when you wake up ‘Do I feel rested?’. If you feel dead until you’ve managed to drain coffee number 3 of the day, then maybe either more sleep or better quality sleep is an area you can improve on. Naps are great for this, if you’re lucky enough to be able to schedule some.

How you go about this is entirely up to you, you can spend as much money as you want (perfect mattress, air conditioning, water circulating blanket) or as little. My personal feeling, and the starting point for most people is to follow some general advice regarding sleep hygiene (Some great resources [here](https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/fact-sheets.html)) and to try to start going to bed earlier each night where possible (start with 15 min, build up as able). Again, there is no need to become completely neurotic about this, but it’s about demonstrating a general trend towards improvement. Alcohol before bed can be very troublesome for some people, too, and can interrupt your overall sleep pattern. 
It's obviously important to accept that there are going to be periods of your life where you are going to get less sleep for whatever reason – young children, puppy, work stress, life stress. At these times, I would always advocate for dropping some intensity from your workouts. Your body is already stressed. Adding more to the heap is probably going to make things worse. 

**Food**

To be clear – I’m not a dietician. If you have concerns about what you’re eating, I would strongly advocate for a good conversation with an appropriately qualified dietician. I would look at qualifications of nutritionists carefully, before you work with them. 

I’m not here to try to persuade you down a certain avenue of what you should be eating. Whether vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, dessertarian, whatever. It’s about balance. You need to be taking in an adequate amount of calories for the amount of work that you are doing, and this needs to come from varied sources. Your body will literally break itself down if it’s not fed enough (Interesting reading [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5751603/) and [here](http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar_url?url=https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/3/835/pdf&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CSiJYJeOCs2aywSdprWYAw&scisig=AAGBfm2QRofnf9VSisc3cSFiQSzibEHXRA&nossl=1&oi=scholarr). The second is more athlete focused, the first makes for general reading on advanced starvation - hyperbolic, maybe, but useful!

One of the main areas that I see people making this mistake is when they are starting a hard training block. They are attempting to increase intensity and volume at the same time as they’re going into a semi-aggressive weight cut of -500kcal per day. This is too much stress for a lot of people. Sure, some people they are able to manage it, but if you are cutting a significant amount of your dietary intake you need to compensate by reducing in other areas.

I think [this](https://www.nutrition.org.uk/healthyliving/an-active-lifestyle/eating-for-sport-and-exercise.html?showall=1&limitstart) is a fairly solid guide to get you going if it’s an area you are unsure of. Nutrition is a minefield of conflicting advice, so beware the huge rabbit hole should you wish to go down that route. Everyone will disagree with everyone else, I personally would advocate for a common sense approach with everything in moderation – plenty of veg, protein source of choice, some carbohydrates. 

You can stress yourself out significantly with nutrition, and especially if you have a history of issues with food, I would suggest seeking expert advice if you feel you need it.

**Life and Work Stress**

I would be being unfair if I attempted to draw a direct line between work stress and increased risk of injury. However, any form of external stress to your running (work, life, illness) is going to affect your ability to recover. The mental fatigue of an awful day at work can take you a long time to get past, and this will show in your running. In terms of how you sustainably weave running into your life this is really up to you, but I would always advise that the really hard sessions should just get shelved if you feel awful, even if it's 'just' mentally. Beating yourself into the ground for your hobby is something you are free to do if you want, but I would advise against it if it’s going to stop you from functioning as the human being you want to be. 

Next Wednesday I'll post something regarding training, and the errors that are commonly made (from the point of view of injury prevention and durability, less so performance). Feel free to ask questions in the comments, and I'll try to respond as and when I'm able. Critisism also welcomed. Thanks for reading, hope you found it useful.",running

**About Me**
27M, 5'11"" (215-162lbs), started running in 2014

&nbsp;
**Current PR's**
1MI - 5:00, 5k - 18:15, Half - 1:22:43, Marathon - 3:02:12


&nbsp;

So as the title suggests, I haven't always been into running. I played sports growing up but never ran just to well...run. I consider myself naturally athletic but not anything outside the norm. In January of 2014 I peaked at 215lbs. Probably ~25-30% body fat. [That's me](http://i.imgur.com/WU0Ih2X.jpg),[That's me again](http://i.imgur.com/jO7yV5I.jpg).  It was at this time I decided that it would probably be a good idea to start fitting into my pants again. So I started running - and hated it. My belly would jiggle and itch and it was uncomfortable and I sucked and where did all the oxygen go? It was a struggle. Some of you reading this are at this point. Please please please keep going! It does get better! I dare you to prove me wrong! 



&nbsp;

With running, diet, and weightlifting, I lost a lot of weight in 2014. [I went from 215 to 175 in 10 months](http://i.imgur.com/qiEwfuB.jpg) and ran my first marathon in Oct 2014. A solid 4:07. I was and am really pleased with this time. It took a lot of hard work and disciple. I don't think I could've ran it any faster. That's the truth. At this point, I was averaging roughly 30MPW not following a plan at all. Some of you reading this are at this point. If you are content, great! Maintain and enjoy! If you're wanting more, it's yours to be had! 


&nbsp;

At this point, it wasn't like I loved running. But I kept going because it just became habit. I know I felt good running and would sorta be put off that day if I didn't get a run in. So I just kept running, upping my miles to ~40-45MPW and again, not following a plan. But being very consistent. In Oct 2015 [I ran my 2nd Marathon](http://i.imgur.com/kEFY5OC.jpg) in 3:37. I was very proud of this time. 40-45mpw for a whole year was uncharted territory for me. It felt great to see that hard work pay off. I honestly thought that 3:30's was my limit and I was 100% okay with that. Boston wasn't even on my radar. Some of you reading this are at this point. Like I mentioned - if you are content, great! If you think your limit is set, I'm happy to tell you that it probably isn't. Limits, like fears, are often just an illusion. 


&nbsp;

Somewhere in the hundreds of miles of running, you go from hating it, to just doing it, to craving it. It takes time, but what worth doing doesn't take time?Going from 3:37 to 3:02 took a lot more effort than 4:07 to 3:37. This is kinda where things get real. I read 'advanced marathoning' by our good friend Pete Pfitzinger. It was then that I realized I had been doing it all wrong. Previously I would typically run as hard as I could every single time I ran. This book taught me about lactate threshold (tempo) runs, strides, long runs, and the much needed recovery runs. It was around this time that I also discovered this subreddit - full of so much great advice. It was also around this time that Boston entered my mind as a legit, lofty, scary goal. I consistently ran ~40-45mpw all through 2016 and picked Pfitz 18/70 plan as my foundation to try and BQ. I followed that plan pretty much to a tee. I'm not going to lie, It is brutal, unforgiving, and very rewarding. If you go down this road, know that you'll have to, at times, plan your life around running. Those 15 Mile mid-week runs get tough when you have to be at work at 8am. Lots of early mornings. This is the hardest I've ever trained and at times I felt like I was pushing my body to the brink of breaking. 


&nbsp;

In Feb 2017, I ran my 3rd marathon. The Phoenix Marathon. [I got down to 162lbs](http://i.imgur.com/RCKCUvP.jpg) for this race (My previous two were both the St. George Marathon, in Utah @ ~175lbs). I struggled big time mentally in the weeks and days leading up to this race. My training was on point but my doubts, fears, and insecurities were all lined up ready to shoot me down. ""You're not good enough, you didn't train hard enough, if you don't BQ - it will all just be a waste."" However, the training held true and I finished in 3:02:12. I broke down right after crossing the finish line and just sobbed like a baby. The feeling of accomplishment, the liberation from all the doubts and fears - it was more than I could bear. [It was a great day to be alive](http://i.imgur.com/6kOIsul.jpg). Through this all, I've come to realize that life isn't so much about finding yourself as it is about creating yourself. I went from never running to hating running to being a proud Boston Qualifier. Some of you reading this are at this point. Including me. So may I collectively ask the question - what is next for us?

And then I saw him point a couple blocks ahead of me to another guy, also running away. For whatever stupid reason in my stupid head, I started chasing the other guy. Now, other guy is about my height, but pretty chubby. I let him run for awhile, scaled a 6 foot wall, and tried to figure out what to do. I could tell he was getting winded, so, as we neared a curb, I sprinted up to him and pushed him forward. Homeboy tripped on the curb and ate sh*t.

Glad that I hadn't been stabbed or something, I grabbed the necklace and found the couple it belonged to (older guy had a huge rock in his hand, ready to smash the guy's face, he told me).

Gave it a full effort for this mile. Brought the good old spikes. It took a lot of hard work and dedicated training to do it. There were 4 runners in the sub 5:00 heat. First lap I took comfortable. Second lap I kept that effort and managed to stay in contact with the guy ahead of me. Third lap I picked up the pace. Fourth lap I tried increasing effort each 100m and by the final half lap my whole body was redlining. Last three laps had negative splits! I am extremely happy with my result and it went better than I was expecting (I was expecting 4:52). My best 1600m time before this was 5:00. Now my best is 4:48 for the full mile, 1609m!

\### Background

I'm a 20M from Belgium, currently studying medicine. As far as running background goes, I had a go at track & field back in highschool but quit when I was 13 years old. Starting fom the age of 16 I would have these spells of running for 4-6 weeks and then forgetting about it for a few months. During the longest of these ""training"" periods I ran a 10 miler (conversational pace) and a 20k (really raced, 5:11/km pace). The only thing I remember from that last race was being super bummed I didn't beat my dad, he was 30 seconds faster than me at the time. Proud to say I'm currently way faster than him, haha.

In October of 2019 I picked up running again and really went after it this time. I discovered this sub, bought Jack Daniels' book and tried to train in the right way. Naturally, I made the big mistake of buidling up my mileage too quick and got an overuse injury of my patellar tendon. Despite that setback, I was hooked. 2020 became my first year of continuous running, apart from a few weeks when I coped with an iron deficiency in the summer. In September of last year I started dreaming of running my hometown marathon, which had its inaugural edition just the year before. I selected the 2Q Jack Daniels plan going up to 40 miles/64 km and started training.

&#x200B;

\### Training

I'm not going to go into too much detail on the specifics of the training plan, as there have been a couple of excellent write-ups on this sub, like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/6ieehb/training_plan_review_jack_daniels_2q_18week/). I'll just talk about how I experienced it and what I changed.

First of all, I enjoyed this plan intensely. Especially the fact that you can choose if and how far you run on 5 days of the week helped immensely in my consistency. Being a college student, I do have a lot of free time, but it's just more comfortable when you can move an easy run to the next day If you have a big exam coming up.

For the workouts, I feel like Daniels is spot on with the progression throughout these 18 weeks. Every training session was hard but doable, and the build-up was clear. I liked the way he included tempo pace or at least marathon pace in almost every long run and the R running was a welcome break from the longer stuff.

Next, I changed very little apart from the goal mileage. I started lower than the prescribed 64km and ended up topping out way higher. Here's the progression (in kilometers per week):

55 -> 57 -> 50 -> 65 -> 75 (strava distance challenge) -> 5 (twisted my ankle playing tennis) -> 61 -> 64 -> 70 -> 75 -> 80 -> 70 -> 80 -> 80 -> 85 -> **90** \-> 55 -> 25 + race

I liked the high mileage weeks and the long runs, that's the main reason I pushed my mileage that high. Speaking of long runs, that's the only other thing I changed about the training plan. In this version Daniels has you peak with two 17 miles / 27km long runs, which I thought were too short. Wanting more confidence in my ability to complete the distance, I ran two 21 milers / 34 km long runs in week 14 and 15. Here's [the strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/4764708434) for the second one, which was my best run in this training block, unfortunately also including my race of yesterday.

Lastly, I'll talk about my taper. This was my first time ever doing a taper and I just tried to follow the plan and the basic guidelines you read everywhere. I tapered for 2 weeks, during which I quit alcohol completely (kind of a hard thing to do as a Belgian college student), I watched my food, hydration and sleep and I tested out my racing kit. Doing my shake-out run of 3 miles the day before the race, I felt fresh and ready to go.

&#x200B;

\### Pre-race

The morning of the race I had my running breakfast, which has been set in stone for a couple of weeks now, because of some horrible experiences on long runs when I didn't eat the usual stuff... It included some oatmeal, bread and chocolate, with a little bit of yoghurt, coffee and water. I picked up my friends who came to cheer me on from the train station and we biked the 3 miles to the starting area.

This was a pandemic-proof event, without time registration, water/food stands or a starting time. So i just showed up to the starting line, started my watch and got after it.

&#x200B;

\### Race

It's go time, the few hours for which I had trained for 18 weeks!

First, I'll talk about what went right. I was aiming for 4:51/km splits, which would put me right under 3 hours and 25 minutes for the race. I based this pace off of my last long run, which I have linked above. For the first half marathon I came in 30 seconds under my goal time so I was super happy. For nutrition, I was taking a gel every 8km and drinking every 5km, which I had practiced during training. My stomach didn't complain once, so definitely satisfied on that front.

Seond, the stuff that went wrong. My friend who was accompanying me asked me how I was feeling at mile 10 / km 16, and I said it's hard, but it should be at this stage, right? Boy, was I wrong. My legs were shot as I started my second lap of the half-marathon course, I think mostly because I pushed too hard against the headwind from kilometer 12 to 21. It wasn't an aerobic thing, my heart rate kept dropping from 170 to low 160's, but my legs just couldn't sustain the pace anymore. At km 32, the point were I initialy wanted to pick up the pace, I was running 5:30/km. At this point all I cared about was finishing the race without walking. These last few kilometers were the hardest of my life and they were terrifyingly slow. My whole body started hurting in a way it hadn't before: abs, shoulders, lower back, and ofcourse my legs. I jogged it in with a measly kick to the finish, feeling accomplished but also frustrated because of the pace. I hadn't looked at my watch the last few kilometers and my average pace had slipped from 4:50 to 5:06/km. Final time: 3:35:06.

Don't get me wrong: I'm super stoked to have finished a marathon. I just don't get why I broke down so early in the race. If you have any thoughts on this, please share below!

&#x200B;

\### Post-race

I layed down next to the finish line for 2 minutes, got up and tried to stretch for a little while. I had a cookie and drank a lot of water and then biked back home, depending on my friends to push me over little hills: my legs were completely shattered. I had a shower, a nice meal and I just relaxed at home for the rest of the day.

It's currently the morning after and it feels like all the little aches and pains I've had in this training block have come back at the same time. All in all, I feel better than I thought I would, thinking I'll do a small recovery jog this weekend.

&#x200B;

\### What's next?

This week is a full rest week, I may play tennis for an hour on Friday and go for a small run this weekend. I've been planning to do a 5K training plan next, I should be able to run sub 20 already so aiming at 19:30. After that, it's either a new road marathon or a slower, hillier trail marathon.

If you've made it all the way through this rambling piece written in my second language, thank you! I've learned so much from this sub, I'll continue to check it out daily the following months. **If you have any questions about my training or the plan from JD, please feel free to ask away.**

489,1608960859.0,I can now run 1.5km thanks to you,"So a little while ago, I posted asking about other methods besides the C25K. I have medical/surgical history/trauma that has led to me being weaker than a lot of others my age.

Anyway, after the advice, I decided to pretty much increase me walking and add in running. I ran until it stopped feeling good and took rest days when I was sore. This has now meant that I can run 1.5km in one go. I have a very loose goal of being able  to run 2.5-3km by the last week of January.

I’m pretty proud of my progress. I know it’s not the traditional way, but I am also working on becoming more in tune with my body on a whole and have started meditation.

The only issue I’m having is managing my calories in. I wouldn’t have thought the slight increase in activity would have that much of an impact on my calorie requirements but I’ve already lost 3kg. I don’t count calories, but I don’t eat fast food or high fat/sugar food as I can’t tolerate it. My stomach is smaller than other people my ages and isn’t able to accommodate what most people would class as a normal sized meal (it won’t stretch or get any bigger either) so I have to have multiple smaller meals through the day. Fortunately I have secured a job that allows multiple breaks during the day but that doesn’t start until end of January.

I run first thing in the morning as it wakes me up for the day. I can’t eat beforehand as it makes me nauseous and then the running itself tends to stop me being hungry. I’m thinking of adding some sort of drink about an hour after my ‘run’ just to keep my intake up.

Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you for being so supportive. I’m enjoying the short time I am running, my body is feeling good and my mind is feeling good. I’m so thankful I’ve been able to do this again, it really is a great activity. The benefits I’m experiencing are very enjoyable even at this short distance. Once I was able to remind myself that it’s about the journey and not the destination I’ve been able to relax more and not be so hard on myself. I’m not going to win any medals, but just the fact that I’m feeling so much better is enough of a win for me.",running

It was probably not the best idea since the longest I've done before this was 15km, but surprisingly my lungs felt completely fine the entire run, my legs on the other hand took a beating, but it was worth it. 

It was meant to be a 10km run but I just kept going because it was the easiest 10k I had ever done. Then, around the 13km mark I start to get the idea in my head ""what if I actually did it, what if I actually ran a half marathon just because why not"". Rest is history.

494,1618149311.0,Race report: I ran my first 10k ever - 50:22,"Training : I started running on January 29th. Before that I was lazy and not really active at all for the last 7 years * I started by running 20 minutes regardless of my pace and distance. For the first two weeks I was inconsistent but I still went to run probably 4 times total. 
On week three I downloaded SportsTracker and I started running for 20 minutes every other day regardless of the circumstances in my life ( being sick, on my period, feeling lazy, horrible weather, visiting my parents in a different part of the country over the weekend, ect) 
After every two weeks I added 5 minutes to my runs. 
After 8 weeks of doing that I was running every other day for 35 minutes and approximately 7 km. I decided to change up my training on Monday (week eleven) I added my 5 minutes but decided to only do 3 runs a week from now on and run a 10k on Sunday ( today). 

Race: It was raining out when I started which made me a bit unmotivated but at the same time there was no wind and I knew the trail is going to be empty because of the rain and I was also looking forward to completing this milestone for a whole week so I decided to just go for it. When I started running I felt great I was just a bit anxious because I knew this run is longer than my others. But when I really got into it and focused on the music, nature and my breathing I forgot about that. When I hit 38 minutes I got this feeling like I won’t be able to continue but I knew it was only in my head so I calmed myself down and just stopped thinking. After that it went smoothly for the last 12 minutes. 

Data:  I am a 21 year old female. I started running 11 weeks or almost 3 months ago. The distance I completed was 10 kilometers, my average pace was 05’01 /km, the duration of my run was 50’22.9 and my average speed was 12,0 km/h

What I learned:
-Staying active is really beneficial for your physical and mental well-being. I feel much more energized and capable now that I live a more active lifestyle.

-Having hobbies that occupy your time and attention is great especially during the pandemic.

-I a capable of things I never imagined if I put in the effort. This helped me believe in myself in other areas of my life too.

-Buy good running shoes, they make a big difference in how you feel.

-Stay consistent.

-Wind sucks but running in the snow/rain isn’t that bad. 

-Don’t push yourself to run in the morning or during the day if you are a night owl like me. It will make your runs unnecessarily harder. 


What now?
I want to run a half marathon (21k) in my country (Slovenia) in October. I plan on training for that even if it doesn’t happen because of covid. I also want to continue running just in general but I have not yet figured out when should I stop adding minutes to my runs and how exactly should I proceed. I know that from now on I will do two normal runs over the week and one longer one during the weekend. 
I know that I really like this sport now and I don’t see myself quitting it because it keeps me sane and happy.

EDIT
* disclaimer : not active at all = not training any sport. I now realize I was still active with my casual biking to get to places in the city, walking about 6k steps on a average day ( again without the purpose to exercise) and going on occasional family hikes. I perceived myself as lazy because for me being active means training something 3,4x a week. Sorry if I was being misleading!",running

I'm a F29, who started running 7 months ago after a breakup. I have done a bit of running during the summer months in the past couple of years, but didn't really get the hang of it. Always quit again when the fall arrived (I live in Scandinavia). 

Two years ago, I went through a long period of sickness that took a hard toll on my emotional well-being as well. It was tough at times.

My body type is average, neither athletic or the opposite but I was always one of the slowest kids in school. I have always resented ""running-events"" at work, because I was never in a particularly good shape. Now, how the tables have turned. As is now, I look forward to almost every run. I have never been good at waking up early, but now, from time to time, I find myself jumping out of bed at around 7 in the morning to run. (WTF is happening?!!)

I feel like I have become one of those crazy running-obsessed people that - to me - have always been part of some obscure party I felt like I was never invited to.

When I started I could NOT run for 5 km straight. Maybe 2 km at best, at a 06:30 pr. km pace. 

Now my PB on 5K is 28:12 mins. and I'm training towards getting below 27:30. I started out slow - didn't run more than twice a week for the first couple of months. Now I run three times a week on average. Also, I have never been able to run 8 KM straight! I know it might be average to many, but to me, 8K is a pretty long run - but this is exactly what I did a few days ago! 

But one of the most magical things I have gained from running, I think, is watching nature. Incredible sunsets and sunrises while running, running in parks and forests watching the colours of the leaves change with the seasons (still need winter, though!) and the animals lulling around while I actually ENJOY the run irrespectively of whether it is rain or shine. 

This makes me emotional at times. Running fast, feeling stronger and in better shape than ever, watching the sun set over the sea, accompanied by a beautiful playlist. That feeling is unbeatable!

I don't really know what the purpose of this post is. I guess I just wanted to share my excitement and happiness with you.

499,1566301663.0,10 years ago today Usain Bolt broke his own 200m World Record in one of the most astonishing athletic performances in history,"[You can watch it here ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DjvvI-0xjc)  

August 2009 at the World Championships in Berlin. Bolt already held both the 100m and 200m records at that time, but those performances at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 were incremental improvements on the performances of other athletes.

In Beijing he ran the 100m in 9.69s, beating his own record of 9.72s which itself was just a fraction ahead of his compatriot Asafa Powell's 9.74s. In the 200m he ran 19.30s, narrowly beating Michael Johnson's longstanding record of 19.32s.

A year later in Berlin it was another story entirely.  

***

First came the 100m where he ran a ridiculous 9.58s, close to what his team said he *could* have run in Beijing if he hadn't jogged over the line. Taking the record down from 9.69s to 9.58s was the biggest jump since the introduction of electronic timing.

What sticks in my mind more though was the 200m. This was the fastest race in history, with a record three athletes running sub-19.90s times. Usain Bolt made them all look like children, such was his dominance. He destroyed them, starting well and powering away from the other fastest men in history, winning in a scarcely credible 19.19s. Michael Johnsons's record had stood since 1996 and was thought unbeatable until Bolt squeaked past it in Beijing. A year later he destroyed his own new record, while **running into a headwind.** It was unfathomable. As Michael Johnson himself memorably said in the booth after the race, the man who can break these records hasn't been born yet.  

***

I'm a fan of many sports, but nothing has ever made me feel close to what I felt watching that race. Sports achievements can often be a little convoluted - there's something slightly niche and contrived about being the best jump shooter in the world, or the best penalty kicker. Sprinting is different. It's more fundamental, more universal. That one week in August 2009 we watched a man move literally **faster than anyone else in history.** I think that's something worth celebrating and remembering.",running

501,1604246201.0,I completed my first 10k yesterday!,"Up until April this year I was a self proclaimed ""non-runner"". I had always wanted to be a ""runner"" but any time I tried it out I'd give up. I would barely be able to run 0.5 km without wanting to wipe out. Back in April I decided now was a good a time as ever to actually... Learn... How to run.

I've been physically active most of my life but my activity has mostly consisted of strength training and HIIT.  Coincidentally I've also been hypothyroid for most of my life and I think this may be what contributed to my hate for anything cardio related. Late 2017 I was instead diagnosed with Graves' disease after having been clinically hypERthyroid (the opposite of hypOthyroidism) for over 3 years. I could barely climb a flight of stairs without being so winded I'd have to sit down. I struggled with relapses and allergic reactions to anti thyroid meds up until May 2019 when I had my total thyroidectomy. April this year was the first time in many years that I measured optimal thyroid hormone levels.

Being hyperthyroid for so long I'm well aware that my heart may have taken some damage, at my worst point I had a resting heart rate of about 120-130 bpm. So this year I decided I'd start focusing on heart-healthy activites. I already walk a lot but for a long time I had been fascinated by the idea of long distance running, so I made the decision to make an attempt at becoming a ""runner"".

Turns out, I had no idea what I was doing the first few weeks. I'd barely be able to run 1k without feeling like I was dying. After a month or two I found a post on this subreddit about what ""running at a comfortable pace"" meant. After reading through the post and comments I realized I was running way too fast. Not objectively fast, but way too fast for me to be able to keep up. I started to only focus on distance and my heart rate as opposed to my actual pace. This is my best advice for anyone starting out running. It doesn't matter how slow you're going as long as you're moving forward.

I ran my first 5k in August, and at that time I also signed up for a Halloween 10k (virtual). Unfortunately life happened between then and now and I didn't keep up with my training. I also got a nasty stomach bug about 3 weeks ago which took a while to recover from. I ended up barely running in the last month before the race but I was determined to do it anyway.

And I did!!! It wasn't fast, I didn't ""race"" it, but I completed it!  I'm super proud that I did. It was a chilly autumn morning and my route was around a big lake. It was tough but still easier than I had imagined it to be and the view really helped.

I have now signed up for a 15k virtual on New Years Eve which I'm excited to work up to. And what's even more exciting is I now want to do a half marathon! I figured I'll sign up for a virtual one, somewhere in the spring as it will give me plenty of time to train without having to stress about it. Any tips or advice regarding training for you first half marathon would be greatly appreciated!

On April 1, I ran a km as fast as I could for a time of 3:40. I trained 6 days a week doing interval workouts, and on April 30, I ran a km in 3:03, still 13 seconds per km off of Eliud's pace.

504,1607435630.0,What do you do when someone purposely moves into your path while running?,"Runner rant. My view is that runners (and cyclists) are faster than walkers, so it’s our responsibility to move out of the way. However when running on a road, everyone should be on the side of oncoming traffic. 

So today, I’m running a trail through a wood, and an old couple are roughly in the middle of the path coming towards me. I get ready to move. The wife sees me, and very kindly moves to the right, and so I move to the left. The husband doesn’t like this, and purposely moves into my path. 

This I’m not happy about so I don’t move, and we find a way around each other. I couldn’t resist saying: what are you doing? He shouted something but I didn’t hear because I just ran on and ignored him. 

Funny end to the story: I run my loop and meet them on the path again. They are having a huge argument, and the wife is refusing to walk with him :-)

Overweight beginner runner here in her mid 20s. Slowly progressing and getting better at it. I run in the city streets because I live right in the middle of a city and have no car to drive anywhere else nice to run. I also run as soon as the sun starts to rise - so around 6am or so.

Ever since I’ve started running I’ve been running in shorts mostly because sweatpants suck and leggings make me sweat even more. Lately, and as we progress into the summer, t-shirts have become cumbersome and I would much rather just not have to work out wearing them. And while I don’t mind at all running around in a tight sports bra and running shorts that leave little to the imagination, I fear that this might be inappropriate and don’t want to “shock” anyone.

What are some your thoughts and experiences on this?

Also, this morning I got my first wolf-whistle ever since I started running from three menacing looking guys in a pickup truck. And I’m an overweight/not particularly shapely female, so I was definitely 1) shocked and 2) disgusted. Is this something that I might have to start worrying about and is staying covered up the only way I can avoid it?

507,1615763872.0,Small change in running posture is having big unexpected results for me.,"I don't know who needs to hear this, but if you are like me this might help you out.

I'm 60. I've been running for about 10 years. I only run on trails, average 20-25 miles/week and I'm wicked slow but I go out consistantly. I've been getting progressively slower over the past 5 years in spite of my consistency and have developed a lot of pain in my knees/hips/back. I don't stretch properly (I'm going to start working on that.)

But what happened this month has been an eye opener. (I can be a little dumb about some things.) I have bad posture, curved shoulders, forward head, etc. I started to try to improve my posture and focus on keeping my shoulders down and back and my chin tucked when I run.

Once I got to keeping this posture I realized I was running faster with less effort, my knees and hips are less sore and I just feel more powerful and efficient in my stride. What I realized is that my elbows had previously been pointing out towards my sides and the momentum of my arms swinging was actually more side to side than they should be. I was slowing myself down and fighting with myself, in a way. With the shoulders back my arms are now swinging in the same plane as my feet are moving.

Like I said I'm kind of dumb. I probably should have known this all along. This is probably common sense to most people but I figure there are some people out there like me, who I hope this helps.

That is all.

We’ve all been hit hard by this pandemic, and it all feels like it’s starting to pile on as the year comes to an end. 

I told myself I’d get out of my head and go for a run. The first few minutes my anxiety/intrusive thoughts were starting to take over and I was close to quitting. I told myself to keep going, even if it’s just a mile. Ended up pushing out 4.5 miles with the fastest pace I’ve had in over a year.

510,1612346806.0,"imma buy myself a watch, and it means a lot.","I just wanted to share a proud achievement of mine. I started running 5k almost everyday last year.  A few weeks in, I wanted to get one of those cool smartwatches for listening to music without having my phone with me, one for tracking all my stats and stuff but I thought: 

""*you're not there yet, you're going to buy the watch and then eventually stop running.*""

 It happens to me that I want to start to do something, I buy the stuff and eventually I never really dive deep into that hobby or new habit. 
 

Now, running is no longer an option, it is something I do every day. I love it. It brings me into rythm like some sort of meditation. I get to be in the forest every day and see how the seasons change it. It is honestly more about the mental health improvement that it brings to me than about the fitness, though fitness is indeed a very cool plus. When my anxiety builds up, which happens a lot, running calms me down and puts things into perspective. I can also consistently drink beer on weekends or have a pizza or pasta on a weeknight with my friends without worrying about getting fat. 

This is both a thank you letter for this sub and running for improving my mental and physical well-being, as well as a sharing post of how the mundane act of buying a smartwatch can be so full of meaning in the right context.

PS: I hope my post complies with the rules and is not better posted in the Q&A or Daily Achivement Thread since I kinda felt it generates discussion around running watches and it's a little bit of both. Sorry if yes, pls dont ban.

514,1604647014.0,I ran with a weighted vest that put me at a weight similar to the one before my weight loss,"So I went from 165 lbs in mid April to 120 lbs now at 5'3"". Throughout this time I've also taken up running - it started as a way to burn extra calories but I really fell in love with it. I look forward to going on a run after a long work day.

My husband bought a weighted vest and was telling me how much harder it was running with it. If I'm being honest, I wasn't really buying it. I thought ""well I used to be heavier than what it would put me at, and I ran then!""

Well I decided to give it a try... And it was so so much harder! I weighted myself with the vest to check how much it's adding, and it got me to 140 lbs - actually a healthy weight for my height, and not even the heaviest I've been. I ran my usual 3 mile run at a pace that normally means I'm relaxing with an audio book, running at what feels comfortable - this time my legs were sore, I was running out of breath, it was hard!

It made me realize how much my weight loss has helped my running, and how things in general every day life then must be a bit easier now... (Although I don't think I could've done 3 miles at yesterday's pace at all when I was 140 lbs so at least my running itself has also improved, which is something I was worried about!)

Within the first two months, I started loving it but felt a bit low when I saw zero changes in my weight. 

I then educated myself on nutrition and started eating healthy. Also added full body strength exercises in my routine with cardio.I achieved a lot of stamina within next two months.

In the last two months, I decreased my calories intake to dangerously low ( I know I shouldn't have done that, but I was too much passionate to get in shape until today, my 18th Birthday).

So I finally achieved it. Not just physical fitness, But mentally too. if you were to see me who I was and who I am today, you wouldn't believe I was that guy.I never lose temper, I am always focused and full of energy. So this is how big the difference is.

I have lost a total of 57 lbs. Went from a 31 BMI  to 21.9 BMI guy, one who couldn't even complete a 400 m round to running a 5k, 8k ,10k, 16k and half marathon.

I now, every morning go for a 5km run (with strength exercises at least 4 times a week, but cardio everyday.)

I can finish a 5k sub 25 minutes (average of my 5 runs)But I do feel like I am way behind.

If you are a more experienced runner than me, then please guide me how to improve my pace and the nutrition too, like I do not want to get obese again ever and neither I want to eat less to lose my stamina and strength.

517,1533239198.0,I never thought I could do it... But I just completed one of my life goals: Run a half marathon,"Let me start off by saying, I was never a runner. Years ago, I could barely complete a mile. But for many years now, I always said I wanted to run a half marathon race.

Before running outdoors I was in mediocre shape. For years, I worked out at the gym: using the stair master and elliptical 3-4 times a week for an hour. Never the treadmill. 

In April, my friend said she was doing the SF Half Marathon and I thought... Let me just take a chance at it. If I sign up, I'll do my best to train for it. So, that's what I did. I only had 3 months to train.

Btw, I am not a morning person. Waking up early to run was difficult at first. But I kept this mentality: Running one mile is better than no mile at all. And that number eventually kept increasing. Also, the feeling after running is so amazing!

Anyways, I just completed my very first half marathon the other day and I'm just so overly happy! I did it! Even though I was very slow (11:49/mile), my goal was to complete it. And now my new goal... is to run *faster.* 

I highly encourage everyone to run a race at least once in their lives. The environment is sooo wholesome and inspiring. I loved lovely random strangers cheering me on with their signs and chalk writing on the ground. It was so so cool. I was smiling throughout the race. 

**Tl;dr:** So ecstatic to complete my life goal of running a half marathon. Please let me know tips on how to run faster. I don't plan to do a marathon, but would love to improve my future half marathon times.

522,1587814904.0,Just broke sub-22 for 5k!,"I ran 22:30 back on October when I was probably at my peak off the back of September marathon. Was focussing in other things over the winter, then as I was building my mileage in January I got injured and was out for 2-3 weeks, then into marathon training block and wasn’t really focusing on shorter distances.

Spent the last five weeks building a base of 40 miles a week but no speed work outs at all, just easy running. Been feeling really good lately so I thought I’d pick a flat course and really see where I was at speed wise and BOY does mileage pay off. 

A bit of background/thoughts for those interested, only started running January 2019 and ran a 30 minute 5k at the end of that month. Ran a sub-1 hour 10k in feb 2019 and a sub-2 half in March/April. I found for the rest of the year I was getting continuous PBs in all distances without really trying which I guess is what happens at first. Going from 30 minute 5k to sub-25 kinda happened naturally, but I’ve found anything sub-23 is a whole different thing. Same with 50-60 minute 10k and 1.50-2hour half. 
Current PBs stand at 21.55 5k (today), 47.03 10k (October last year), 1.47 half (December last year), 4.18 marathon (only marathon, September last year). 
I’m hoping to run sub-45 10k and sub 1.45 half in the not too distant future, but still just focusing on base building. Will start to throw in some tempo work in the next few weeks. Sub-22 5k was my goal today and I did it! 

Also just a funny story - I had made a playlist that was under 22 mins long and I had forgotten what the lady song was, so when Mr Brightside by the Killers kicked in which I thought was the last song and I was still not close to the end of my route I thought I’d screwed it up.

525,1615140049.0,Does anyone else get runner's rage? What happened? How do you handle it?,"40F currently running in a mid-sized city, and grieving after my father's death from COVID on January 28th.  Besides the grief, I'm in a constant state of low-grade irritation that is easily triggered into outright anger given the ""right"" circumstances.  Things like: couples holding hands and not breaking up to single file, so then I have to jump off the sidewalk; cars idling over the crosswalk so that I have to run behind the car; people riding their bike on the sidewalk.  I percolate with irritation, although I don't actively react to them.  But the thing that has triggered me in the last few weeks is men honking.  Unlike, a lot of women, I'm lucky in that it doesn't happen too often; I'd say once or twice a week, but not every run. I've always hated honking because my initial impulse is that I'm going to get hit.  Lately though, and I don't say this with pride, I've been flicking of men who honk.

Today, I was at a stoplight when a guy honked, and I gave him the finger.  I saw his face and how quickly it flipped to rage.  I sort of realized: ""Hmmm. I don't really have the power in this situation,"" and that scared me. But, also, if I'm being honest, it felt kind of good, like the guy was finally being told for the first time, ""You're a gross, POS.""

I guess I'm wondering if anyone else gets this type of ""runner's rage"", how you react to it, whether it's ever gone off the hinges, or if, you've been able to reel it in.  I know I need to stop this, that I could potentially get myself in a worse situation by setting someone off.  But, part of me doesn't want to stop, at least not yet.

**Edit:** Thank you all for your amazing insight and compassion.  Your comments were hugely helpful, and in the most Reddit thing ever, a surprise cameo from my sister r/runningdivorcee (who is a much better runner than me and a wonderful human).

I have no doubt that my heightened sense of anger, especially when it comes to men, is intertwined with the loss of my dad. He was a great father, and there's this flicker of a second where... when I am getting honked at, I think about my dad, how he always believed in me, and I am angry that not every man is the same.  It makes no sense, I know, which is why the many suggestions of counseling are good ones.  I am going to do that, while also trying to be kind to myself. 

I do want to affirm that women should have a right to be angry at being honked out or cat-called. It's a power play by men, and honking can be terrifying because it tells me I am not aware of something that could harm me.  To those who suggest some do friendly honks, honks of support, I'd say, even if that was the intent, don't do it. It's just another thing we have to provide attention to, and it definitely throws me off. 

Still, part of me wants to continue showing my dislike of being honked at because maybe they won't do it to the next runner.  One Redditor made a suggestion that she give the ""thumbs down"" sign when she gets honked out.  It had never occurred to me to do that, but I think it's a nice compromise between setting someone off and not doing anything at all.  

Lastly, since this post has gotten attention, and my sister made the good point about focusing energies on the right things, I want to encourage you all to get the vaccine when it comes available to you. My dad died because he'd fallen, broken some bones, and was in care home for physical therapy.  At this point, all the employees were given access and the choice to take the vaccine.  Because they got to choose, some didn't take the vaccine, and my dad got COVID and died.  So, get the vaccine, look out for each other, and keep running.  We all know, that maybe during the run not everything goes to plan, but when it's over, we're in a better headspace.

19 year old male, 6 feet tall

&#x200B;

Well its been one year since my last race where I was trying to get sub 30. After it I was ready to keep trying for it but got injured the last day of 2019 and was out till mid May then I injured myself again a week after starting again. During these two injuries (Achilles tendonitis, and Bruised Bone at knee) wasn't doing the best mentally and ended losing the discipline I'd built up to that point and gained weight. Then mid August rolled around and I started to feel better. My training ramped up pretty quick. Running 16.6 miles in August, 27 in September, 54.2 in October and 67.6 in November. These past two months I really dived head first into running and eating better, and ended weighing less than I did this time last year, around 260, when I was 270 last year and around 300 in May. When I got injured the second time I really learned how much running meant to me so I swore to start running as soon as I could. Honestly my training went pretty well. I planned my runs based on the knowledge I built up over my 2 years of running. However, I think I did train a little too hard these past couple weeks and ended feeling some lower leg pain

&#x200B;

I ate really clean yesterday and went for a 2 mile jog at 10 min pace. Was pretty easy and felt good. Though I guess nerves got to me and I didn't go to sleep till 3 hours before the race at 5am. Though I woke up pretty fresh and met up with my friend who I convinced to train and do it with me.

&#x200B;

First Mile: From my experience before, I knew I needed to go out calm and not get caught in the moment and crowd. I averaged around 10 min pace till the bridge came to which I speed up, and eventually caught up to my friend on the downhill. I felt really good and knew I could potentially go faster than last year. Something I tried doing around the end was saying out loud to my friend that I was going to get sub 30.

&#x200B;

Second Mile: At this point I slowed down to a consistent 10 min pace with the intent to not burn myself out like I have in the past. I started to feel it in my muscles but I kept repeating a quote to myself I've heard ""Don't stop when you're tired, stop when you're done. Around this time I started to smile and just enjoy the moment and the beautiful day it was outside. I also saw a dude already running back with croc on so that gave my motivation aswell. I also started passing people which helped give me a boost of confidence

&#x200B;

Third Mile: My friend who had went ahead I had caught up to again and we decided to finish it out together. This is when it really started to hurt and going up that bridge I defintely thought about walking for a few secs but decided it wasn't something I'd be happy with when it was over. I also passed like a 5 year old who was running fast by himself and he gave me a boost of moral to keep going. The last .3 miles of that mile was brutal and I just was trying to focus on my breathing

&#x200B;

Final stretch: I just dug down and started to sprint because at this point I realized I needed to pick it up to get sub 30. This was pretty brutal but I saw my family which gave me that last boost of motivation to finish it out hard.

&#x200B;

Post-Race: I took some photos with my friends and family and just celebrated the fact that I got sub-30, something that I've want for 2 years now. I'm really happy with myself. However I still know I can go faster if I keep losing weight so I'm not satisfied and will looking for the next race pretty soon. But for now Ima enjoy this day with my friends and family, take some time off to recover since I've had some pains these past weeks.

While I have never been a ""runner"" I knew that for my long term health it was probably one of the single best practices I could develop. 

   I used the Couch 2 5k app to get me through the first 6 weeks, starting with the pain and panic inducing first few days of thinking my heart would explode out of my chest to the first day I went running for 20 minutes straight. All along the way reading and absorbing tons of advice and encouragement from members of this sub (albeit by lurking only).

   This past weekend I ran my first 5k ever at age 41 with a race time of 34:50. Not an impressive time by any means but my goal was to be able to finish the entire 5k running/jogging and have a smile on my face when I crossed the finish line vs. making a straight line for an oxygen tank. Mission accomplished! My favorite picture of the day is one my wife took of me coming around the last corner towards the finish line with a big grin on my face.

   My kids kept asking me if I was proud of how I did in the race that day. I told them I was thrilled about how I did in the race, but what I was ""proud"" about was the 4 months of work I put in so that I would be ready for the race. 

   Just wanted to share my experience and thank the members of this sub for unknowingly supporting and encouraging a middle-aged man who decided to take control of his physical fitness and start running.

I could use my phone or get a fancier watch but I’m not concerned about the metrics newer watches can provide. And carrying my phone or buying a strap for my phone doesn’t interest me. I just strap on the watch and my shoes and off I go. 

I had to replace the battery a couple years ago but it works like a champ still, and even if I ran every day I wouldn’t have to charge it for a few weeks. I’m pretty sure the watch will outlast the strap.

537,1596219071.0,Finding peace with doing less and moving slower has helped me run more consistently and healthfully than I thought I was capable of.,"TLDR: I appreciate and salute all you amazing runners out there, with all your different goals and speeds and styles. Being a runner is committing to running. It’s as simple as that, and I’m finally proud of myself for it. 

I am they type of perfectionist that doesn’t think they can be a perfectionist cause I’ve never achieved doing anything perfectly. I have intense performance anxiety and have struggled with running for years. I never thought I ran enough miles, or with enough speed, and I have made myself feel like shit about it and my body since I started running cross country at 12yrs old. 

I have struggled so much emotionally with running that I quit 4 years ago. This March I warily started running again since I was going COVID stir crazy and the snow was finally melting.  I set a loose and arbitrary goal of running 200 miles by my birthday. Breaking that down I needed 6 miles a week. I just completed my first 100 miles this week. Some days I run 1 mile, some days 5 miles. Some days I run 9:37 min/miles, some I do in 8:43 min/miles. I don’t avoid hills, I don’t avoid other exercises to save my energy to run hard and far, and I don’t berate myself to the point of desperation if I have a slow run or haven’t improved. I no longer hate the act of running cause I no longer use it as weapon against my self and self esteem. I am just concentrating on running regularly, having patience, and finding my pace. 

I think it’s important for people to have goals to reach for, races to run, times to beat and mileage to hit, but I also feel like allowing yourself to just be however good you are at something and letting that be enough is SUPER hard yet SUPER important. I will never be a 7 minute mile-er, I will never run an ultra marathon, and I will always want fast jams booming to keep my feet moving. I’m finally ok with that, and I really just want to be a consistent runner, to keep moving miles every week and spend that time with myself and on myself.

538,1581463919.0,Three ways to reduce injuries from a super injury prone runner,"Hi Runnit,

as the title says, I used to be a super injury prone runner. Last year I was battling runner's knee during my marathon training segment, before that it was shin splints, before that Achilles, before that I was having back pain. I know how FUCKING FRUSTRATING it is to skip workout after workout (frustrating but correct when injured) or pushing through the pain in order to be happy and then end up with a fucked up <insert random body part here> (this is dumb, don't do it...source: I am dumb). For me it was constant battle whether I should rest and be pissed about missing workout or worsening the injury. No fun.

Last year I started to work with a coach and we narrowed down some things I am not doing and should for better injury prevention. Since that I've never had a hint of injury *knock on wood* and I am on a higher mileage than I ever was. I am typing these things now in hopes it can help someone avoid the stupid shit I was (not) doing. Maybe it is clear and I just didn't want to see it but if it helps someone, I'd be glad:

1) If you have a hint of injury, REST. If you end up injured, CONSULT WITH A PT!

The first part is self explanatory. I know it is hard to pause the training cycle. It is better than have way bigger portion of your training cycle paused involuntarily because you have a mobility of an average concrete block. Rest at least until you can do the hop test: if you can hop on both of your legs 10 times on the spot, 10 times forward and backward and 10 times from side to side - you are cleared to run. Still make sure to monitor your body and if it hurts, FOR GOD'S SAKE CALL IT A DAY. If you end up with an injury, find a good PT, they WILL help you recover as fast as possible. Trust me, that 60 dollar investment will improve your goal race time way more than these shiny Nikes.

2) Nutrition - part 1

Everybody and their mothers say it. Nutrition is important. Listen, I enjoy Big Macs like the other guy and there is only so much chicken breast with broccoli you can eat before you start hating your existence. But nutrition IS important. It is important for your performance but mainly for injury prevention - there is this part of the nutrition called protein which is a bunch of living little guys that help to patch the muscles you voluntarily tore down. It doesn't need to be a rocket science. At least make sure you get enough protein. A rule of thumb is 1.3 grams of protein per 1 kilogram of your weight. You can do a little less on your easy days and should do a little more on your hard workout days. I know. It isn't easy to eat so much protein a day and we already ruled out daily eating of chicken with broccoli. Buy a damn protein shake, mix it with milk and it is a protein bomb. I use the MyProtein Isolate but use whatever, just make sure you get enough protein. Also, consider whether you really want to be on a caloric deficit during training for marathon. Wink wink. Source: I already told you I'm dumb.

3) Nutrition - part B

Another important part of your nutrition to prevent injury risk is calcium. This is what I learned from Navy Seals that recommend a daily intake of 1000mg a day to prevent injuries during training. You can get calcium in many ways, I am a lazy fuck (hilarious to tell that as a marathon runner, but it's true) so I eat calcium supplements. Hey, don't shout at me that it isn't the optimal way. I already told you I'm dumb two times.

4) Strength training

You don't drive on flat tires, do you? Why would you run on ones? Your muscles, tendons and ligaments (I don't know what these terms mean anatomically, I heard them in relation to running and pray I used them correctly) need to be strong in order to withstand the load you are going to throw at them. There are two ways to strengthen them - lifting weights or doing hill repeats. I do the latter as a part of warmup (4x 30s at mile effort with a recovery jog) because I would hate to be around the actually fit people. Or you can buy a TRX and torture yourself to death. Your call.

5) Core training

Imagine your body as a can of beer. As long as it has a strong core (can body) it can hold a lot of weight. Make a dimple into it though and it will break down easily. Don't do it when drunk, or else you will break down. That's the dumbest way to injure yourself. (Source: I think you get the point). It doesn't need to be strenuous or time consuming. Just do a front plank and side plank on each side. Front plank 2x as long as side planks. Start on something achievable and increase by 10s (5s on sides) every two weeks. Your core will be stronger and as a result your form will improve which is healthy. And obviously, the most important thing is you will look good on race photos if you run with good form (Source: ...uhh...I'd rather skip this one).

Now that you finished reading, get the hell out for a run. (Unless you are injured, didn't you read the first paragraph goddammit?)

TL;DR: Bunch of obvious unsolicited advice mixed with several utterly stupid jokes. I actually admire (and a little bit pity) everyone who managed to read that.

I'm a black guy in my early 30's with a crystal clean record, put man I'll be honest sometimes I feel nervous about training outside due to the fact that when some people see a black guy running down the street they think trouble, not that I'm running for health or training for an event. Sometimes I see cop look at me intently and it gets a bit scary, I always wave.

543,1588948405.0,My unexpected Marathon,"So i will start with some info about me, im 33 years old, just average runner , i run 2-4 times a week when i can. i Weigh about 86kg, 187cm tall. previously longest run half marathon when i was in better shape than i am now.

This was not an official race, i just ran by myself.

Day started waking up early (have had problems sleeping last 2 weeks) and i figured i would eat some breakfast, had 3 eggs and 2 pieces of bread 2 dates and some coffe.

I went out planning to do 2-4 laps on my regular ""track"" , it is a lake wich is 4.2km in length. Gravel path with variable ""altitudes"" up and down some spots.

After lap 2 i was feeling good but knew i didnt have any nutrition with me except from a gatorate bottle (i have no idea what is best to have during long runs) so i figured i would call up my brother after lap 5, and if he answered and could deliver 2 bananas and 2 gatorades i would finish 10 laps.

So he answered and drove out while i did lap 6, returned to the parking area and 2 bananas and 2 gatorades were placed on my car. Was feeling good after i chugged a banana and half a gatorade for about half a lap then on lap 7 1/2 i crashed hard.

Everything was bad, feet, nipples was bleeding through my tshirt, wind was blowing and my sweat was drying up.

But i just had this feeling, that this was the time i had to do it, i could not fail myself this time. Everything on my mind was one step at a time, and i had all these weird conversations with myself in my head. (did not listen to music)

I was making up names for the laps, lap 7 was decision lap, lap 8 was coffe  grout lap (dno why but my legs were feeling like they were going through a coffe grinder. Lap 9 was ""there is nothing for you here but work and pain"" lap. Because i was thinking about when i finished and the glory that awaited me. Every time i thought that i just reverted to that mentality, there was nothing for me here but putting in work and pushing through pain. Lap 10 was my soul round, i was in such bad shape i didnt really know what to think, but i felt like my own soul was in front of me pushing me through.

I finished with a time of 4 hours 8 minutes 26 seconds. I thought what awaited me was glory, but no, i started getting concerned if i was going to maybe pass out or worse. But i am still here

Edit:  I should also say (to add to how ridiculous I’m being and that I need to get over myself). Last year I ran the 28K version of this 50K. My 28K time was 8:30 and this year my 30K (of the missed 50K) was 6:30. With about the same elevation gain as last years 28K.

It does however rub in that I missed the downgrade deadline by a week when I finally gave in that I wasn’t ready for the 50.

546,1602008485.0,First marathon! Done Solo!,"This past Saturday [I ran my first solo marathon](https://imgur.com/a/IPzaQZa). I am by no means a fast runner and am a solid Clydesdale but here is the breakdown:

1st Quarter: Miles 0-6.5 - 80mins

This was a breeze. My splits were right around the 11:55 to 12:15 mark. Mind was in full zen mode as most of my training runs had been in this length. As I was nearing the end of this segment, my body finally caught up with my mind and I had to stop to use the bathroom as all of my early morning attempts were thwarted. 

2nd Quarter: Miles 6.5-13.1 - 90 Mins

Gravel is starting to invade my shoes, more people are showing up on the trail with bikes and things are getting a bit warmer. My gallon of water I packed with me is starting to wear a little on my back so its time to start taking some water in. [I also stopped to take a quick picture of a local black bear up on the side of the mountain.](https://imgur.com/vfoyckG) 

3rd Quarter 13.1-19.6 100 Mins

The heat of the day is starting to catch up with me and the amount of water I'm taking in means I may run out by the end. I stop to eat a protein bar in the shade as my carb loading from the night before seems to have warn off. At mile 16 my body was not having it but I pushed through after a quick stop and stretch and it was time to go again. 

4th Quarter 19.6-26.2 120 Mins

Alright Jeff, you can do this... ""I Know I can... I know I can"" repeats in my head often. My pace has slowed to that of a brisk walker but I make sure to keep in my running form. I'm down to my last liter and just imaging the taste of the two Gatorade mixes I have in the car. As I am coming down the back stretch, I always break the long run down into a percentages and what percent of the run are you willing to allow yourself to walk at your normal pace. For me since this was my first marathon, I said 90% run would be acceptable. Well, I walked the first 1/4 miles and haven't since so I start doing the math. At mile 23.75 I could take a pass and walk the rest of it home and would be ""acceptable"". But Fudge that! Press on! Those ladies who are talking louder than sin...keep them at your rear and keep going. When I hit the the 25th mile and my body said ""enough, walk it home...its been a long day"". So I slow down to an abysmal walking pace and can just *feel every step*. No more gliding as the sun beats down on my face. As I reach the start line I pump my fists in the air and let out an internal scream of success. ""You did it!"" Then I promptly head to the car, hugged it for still being there, and reclined and drank my juice, contemplating my first time. 

**Total time 390 Mins**

**Distance: 26.2 Miles**

**Average Split time: 14:52**

At the beginning of the year, I could barely run a quarter mile at this pace without feeling like I was going to die, so this is a huge step for me. Next step...get faster :))

We typically run on asphalt and concrete instead of foliage covered dirt. A tradeoff perhaps on superficial injuries vs more insidious ones? 

Most of us are far more sedentary, maybe they we able to train more muscle groups through games and various gathering habits? 

Lastly, perhaps stress and less sleep? I would guess most of us experience less intense momentary stress but a more often constant kind of stress?  And since hunter gatherer types only worked~4 hours per day they probably were always well rested

Running last week was seriously interrupted by a dime/nickel sized removal of a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) from my upper forehead right by the usual hairline. I still have all my hair :). 

Cause--not wearing suncreen in my youth (aahhh, the 1970s, when smoking was unfortunately rampant and riding carefree in the back of a station en route to full fat ice cream was great fun). I previously had a BCC patch removed from my back neck/shoulder area right above the (running) shirt line. I've worn sunscreen for decades (and worn a hat for most of that time) but it takes decades to develop. Running all these miles, exposed to the sun, puts us at greater risk for sun damage and BCC.

Things happen as we get older, which includes various maladies. This is one of them but mostly easily preventable. [People of all colors can get BCC](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer.html)

I'll be fine as BCC is generally easily curable by the removal of the BCC area, but the discomfort and need to heal without pain, and without bleeding through the stitches to reduce scarring, meant complying with medical advice not to run last week and most of this week. BCC is the ""best version"" of skin cancer to get, but [there's worse like squamous cell and melanomas](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer.html).

So wear sunscreen now to avoid sun damage and making this post yourself decades from now. And, for long runs, I generally wear what I call a [French Foreign Legion hat](https://www.runningwarehouse.com/Headsweats_Protech_Hat/descpage-HPH.html) that you can get from anywhere (the link is just one example) because your neck and shoulders are also exposed.

Plus, you'll look fabulous from the absence of sun damage (though despite my middle aged but youthful looking appearance from decades of wearing sunscreen, I still got BCC).",running
553,1391033296.0,"Runners of Reddit, Please quit doing this. Pass it on to your non-Redditing friends.","Parks can be a wonderful place to run, I should know, I got my job because I have always enjoyed running in the park where I now work. Many city parks close at sunset, including the one I work in, hence the reason for this post. If we runners can track every minute detail of our run online, and with all these great little gadgets and toys, we can certainly look up what time sunset will be, and what time our park closes. 

We don't really think about how not observing this rule affects others. As the guy who is in charge of making sure the park is clear, seeing a car still in the lot at closing time is concerning. There are a myriad of things that go through my mind, but the biggest thing that always runs through my mind is that someone is hurt on the trail. I hop on my gator, and run through all the trails until I find the straggler, praying the whole time that I am not going to have to radio in a casualty. More often than not though, I end up chasing down a runner who ""lost track of time."" By city rules, I cannot let the person get in my vehicle, so I all I can do is tell the person that the park is closed, please return to their vehicle. That should be a clue to head directly to their car, but in so many cases, I find the person down another trail, not headed towards their car, and the excuse is ""I just wanted to finish my run!"" At this point, you're just being a dick. 

Here's the thing though, with such a high percentage of occurrences being runners (In fact, just about every single time), it jades the night ranger. He sees the car, he knows it's probably just another runner, yeah whatever. They can make it back on their own. Maybe it's a rainy or snowy evening, and the ranger just really doesn't feel like being bothered in suiting up, and just waits for the runner to emerge from the trail. Meanwhile, someone is lost on the trails, or has had a heart attack, has broken a leg, snakebite (there are canebrake rattlesnakes in my park) or any number of things that can occur on a nature trail. This is why I go out every single time, but I can tell you that not every ranger is as concerned, because they know that every time they go, it's just another (explicitive) runner. Honestly, I've heard so many disparaging remarks about the rudeness of runners, I don't even talk about my own preferred pastime. At a recent event where I was able to talk to other rangers, ranger aides, and volunteers from around the country it was the same story, even from those of us that run. Several runners have been banned from our park for repeatedly breaking the sunset closing, or being obstinate. When we tell you that the park is closed, it is no different from telling you a store is closed. You can be fined for trespassing, and if you're in a gated park, your car can be ticketed as well as towed. 

tl;dr - If the park closes at sunset, don't let the sun set on your car in the park. 

Edit: Yes folks, I hear you don't like hearing that a park closes. Loud and clear. I don't make the laws though, so if a park in your town has hours of operation you don't like, then please petition the city. That's not what this post is about. As for your tax dollars paying my check, I'll agree they do. They also pay for the police department, fire department, department of transportation, city council, school board, school system, public works, state's attorney, DEA, FBI, CIA, US Armed forces, department of labor, department of the treasury, and a thousand other government agencies. When it comes to funding, how fast is the department of Parks and Recreation cut? Without money, there isn't staffing, and without staff, we cannot ensure your safety in the parks that we maintain for you. 

An added little something now, since we're talking money. You won't find a ranger at any level that's doing the job for the money. [These guys get paid well compared to state and local Park Rangers](http://www.today.com/travel/confessions-national-park-ranger-729647), money isn't what makes being a ranger the best job in the world.

554,1609532760.0,I did my first ever half marathon on New Year's Eve!," About 2 months ago I made another post, at that point I had just finished my first ever 10k. [Link to post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/jm4j4m/i_completed_my_first_10k_yesterday/). 

*TLDR of that post; Before quarantine I had barely ever ran more than maybe 1k. I decided to give it a legitimate try and if it didn't stick, so be it - at least I gave it an honest try. I've also struggled with thyroid disease and wanted to better my cardiovascular fitness. Wellll long story short - I caught the running bug and here we are ~9 months later.*

 After I had ran my 10k I realised I loved the feeling of pushing myself and I felt like I was finally a *~*real runner*~*! I originally signed up for a 15k virtual for New Year's Eve. Mid December I started playing with the idea of pushing myself and to finish off the year with a bang and do a 13.1. I had originally planned to go for the 15k and then later, in the spring, do a half marathon.

 Now, I understand I may get some hate for this. Yes, you should train properly. No, maybe don't push yourself if you feel like you're nowhere near capable of going the distance. My plan was that if I felt any type of weird pains or aches, I would stop. I've previously had some issues with a tendon in my left foot and I knew that if it gave even the slightest bit of discomfort I'd have to stop.

 I woke up the day of feeling stoked. Hadn't gotten the best night's sleep but I had slept pretty good the weeks going up to the event so it didn't bother me much. I had a breakfast, caffeine, changed, did a warm up, and out I went. It was cold, it was wet, it was pretty horrible but damn did I feel ready to *conquer the world*!

And so I did. The first 10k felt awesome, but around 14k I definitely ran right into a concrete wall (figuratively speaking). That feeling of near exhaustion (and I guess a bit of boredom) lasted until around the 16th k. At around 15k I had my second energy gel and I guess I can thank that one for the second wind. I felt like an absolute beast until I had about 1k left, and that one was an absolute struggle.

 It's now one night post race and I'm not feeling close to as horrible as I thought I would. I absolutely thought I'd feeling like I got hit by a truck. I'm sure the 2nd day soreness will be a little rougher though.

 Honestly, I don't care if this post gets zero upvotes I'm just so gosh darn proud that I finished 2020 with a fricking half marathon and it's one of my coolest accomplishments yet, at least in my book. I want to thank myself for being a real sport and sticking with running even on the days that I hated it. I also want to thank My Favorite Murder (podast) for carrying me through the entire race and keeping boredom at bay.

### Training
I started running consistently about a year and a half ago as a way to deal with anxiety and help my overall mental health. Since then, I've started and failed several marathon plans either from overtraining or illness. I originally set out with the goal of running a 3:30 marathon with the long term goal of running sub 3 and qualifying for Boston (I'm 29 yrs old). In January, I felt like I was in peak fitness doing 55-70mi a week when I was hit with severe food poisoning that sidelined me for two weeks and caused me to lose 10lbs. I recovered well without losing much fitness and I ran a 1:31 half marathon as a compromise to my original marathon goal. This marathon was entirely unplanned and popped into my head on Friday when I noticed how easy my 14mi run felt. So, I ran 7mi of recovery on Saturday and decided Sunday that I would just go for it and see what happens.
### Pre-race
Nothing special, had a big dinner the night before and two cups of deathwish coffee (with plenty of water) for breakfast. Legs felt strong and I had zero reason to feel any doubt. After 30 min of my typical pre-run yoga routine (mostly hip opening stretches), I walked half a mile to my usual starting point. The same route I do 6x a week.

### Race
First 10km was essentially the minimum route I run every day. A loop from Fort Mason to the Golden gate bridge and back. I stopped once about a mile in to quickly use the bathroom. The first 5km was essentially just a warmup. Taking note of my relatively low heart rate, I felt even more confident in going the distance. After 5km, I settled into my marathon pace of roughly 7:45 per mile. Over the course of the run, I was very generous about taking pit stops to drink water and those were the miles with slower splits. I consumed a gel at the 8, 14, and 18 mile marks. My stomach never really complained but the last one felt a little heavy, the extra water breaks helped.

I was completely in control and it felt like a normal long run until about mile 23-24 when I noticed my mood start to dip. My legs had no problem holding on to the pace though, so I just focused on how proud I was going to feel afterward. The last 10km was going into a headwind through the crowded Fisherman's Wharf. At this point I was dodging kids and families and straight up running through red lights while gesturing towards cars with a half hearted ""thank you"". During the last mile I was just letting out loud grunts and ""HEY""s when little kids jutted out in front of me (sorry tourists!). My left knee almost locked up running on and off curbs to avoid them.

The worst part of the finish was having to double back into Fishermans wharf to hit 26.2 lol. I told myself that I could run the last stretch as slow as I needed to to finish but thankfully my pace never really dropped off. I finished with a moving time of about 3:25.

### What's next?
Yesterday's run was about proving something to myself. I've been running obsessively for the entirety of the pandemic but had yet to run an actual marathon. I was so tired of explaining to friends and family that I'm a marathon runner who has never run a marathon! That had to change and yesterday felt like a day to push myself. As I didn't have a structured training plan coming into this (just building fitness  with 50-60 mile weeks) and no real taper, I feel like I could probably crush this time in a real race with a pacing group. But today I just feel proud that I can finally call myself a legit marathon runner! At my age group, it seems like I'll have to shave about 30 minutes off this time to have a chance at qualifying for the Boston marathon, but I'm 100% willing to put in that work.

Thanks for reading! I have no running friends to share this with, so I'm thankful for the running communities on reddit.

558,1591152065.0,"I enjoy running in theory and when it’s over, but I dread starting it every time. I hate how uncomfortable it gets and how much it hurts/I struggle. Are there mental/psychological strategies I can adopt to stop being a wuss and toughen up pre-run?","Self-explanatory title, but here are more deets:

Every morning I wake up early for a run and I dread it every single time. Though I do love running as a workout, I hate how much I struggle through it and the discomfort that I often have to bear through (to be fair, I’m quite the wuss). I’m always out of breath. I get side stitch every single time. My body is fat and feels like it just gets in the way.

In sum, I’m really fat and trying to run to lose weight, but me being fat and so out of shape is what makes running so miserable.

What are some tips that would make me psychologically/mentally stronger to endure longer and longer runs, and stop me from giving up?

Edit: wow, thank you all for the wonderful responses. I actually spent so long reading them all that I ended up not going for a run this morning, hah, and now it’s a little too warm and busy outside to do it. I definitely think I may be overworking myself so decided to just focus on some weight training today. I’m definitely an impatient person and feel like I really have to work on that. I gotta take it slow. Thank you for being so kind and taking the time to put your thought into this!",running
559,1602704975.0,Moab 240 Ultramarathon Race Report!,"This last weekend I finished my first 200+ mile race in Moab, UT

Total time: Just under 96 hours (4 days)
Total elevation-gain: 29,000’ 
Total distance: 240 miles 
Place: 44th out of all the finishers
Total racers: ~200

First day:
The first day was MUCH hotter than expected, with the crux of the day being late afternoon going through a section I can only describe as an oven. 100 degree desert temps, with no shade, and no wind. Almost 40-50 runners dropped at this point- which is a record. One section late in the afternoon was 20 miles between aid and water. I researched the route before hand so I drank almost 8 liters of water before reaching this station, then downed another liter or two at the aid station prior to the section, then took off. I saw super strong racers run out of water with 12 miles remaining in the section. UTTER BRUTALITY and cramping out there. If you didn’t play it strategic, you lose and you drop. I kept up with Goggins for around 25 miles, but after mile 30 he took off and never saw him again. Picked up my pacers at mile 78. 

Finished the first 100 miles in ~26 hours 12 min. 

Second day:
Another hot day with a lot more elevation gain. The views got better as we gained in elevation and we could finally get out of the canyon floors. Exhaustion started setting in a bit at the end of day two and my aid station visits started lasting hours to deal with hydration, foot cleaning, rolling out. Still in high spirits and around 18th place. The night running was actually pretty nice, but brought way too much extra clothes since it was supposed to be cold. 

Third day:
Here’s when the wheels started to come loose. The first objective was 26 miles on gravel flat road. I changed from trail runners to road runners to keep my feet fresh- thank god I did since it was a long day out. Started at 6:30am and finished about 7-8 hours later. This day was SO “blah”. Everything looked the same, only one aid station in the middle at mile 13. Worst of all was 5 miles of road running intertwined. My legs seized up and my pace slowed. Then the desert winds picked up and I was eating sand and dust. Then it rained and the temps dropped. The last two miles of this section I was loosing it. Probably the hardest 2 miles of running of my life (until the next day). I got to the aid station and dropped into the car to sleep for an hour. I then stuffed my face and lethargically got ready for the next night section. We started an hour before sunset (which was beautiful) and then marched upwards through the night. We reached the aid station around 11:30pm in good time. 

Fourth day: 
The wheels came off!! I can honestly say 3:30am on this 4th day was the lowest I’ve ever been in my entire life. After 3 total hours of sleep and 185 miles, I was WRECKED. I felt disconnected from my body and mind like I was stuck laying face down in concrete. I could hear people saying words but nothing was processing. Thank goodness I had a super supportive crew who was able to drag me and prep me out of the station. This next section I did with my best friend, but was the most elevation gain in the race- ~5k feet. My “run” was more like a shuffle and my friend said he started walking backwards easily keeping up. We saw 4 sets of glowing eye attached to HUGE bodies. Either bears or cougars. We’re thinking cougars since one followed us. But hey- thanks for the free adrenaline that got me to the next station.

The second half of the day was pretty much downhill. 22 miles down hill and then about 16 miles to the finish line. The last 3 miles of the 22 mile section I could hardly move and started to hallucinate faces watching me on the trail as the sun set. The desert dust plugged up my lungs and kept me coughing for most of it. The last section my ankle started acting up with pain that progressively got worse until the end. But I finally powered through the night and finished right as the sun was coming up. 

This was definitely the hardest race of my life and hardest thing I’ve ever done. I’m resting now and eating tons of food. So thankful to have finished and had such an amazing time with my friends and family that came to help crew me during the race.

Rain, shine, cold, hot. No matter what I would get and still get my miles. Started with 2 then went on to 3,4,6 and now back to 4 because it’s way to hot for 6 all the time where I live. 

EDIT: 

WEIGHT: 265lbs to 165lbs

RUNNING: I started by just deciding to finish 2 miles. It was all walking when i started. After a while I managed to run out 1 and walk back the second. Then it turned into running both. My first ever mile when i started running i think was in the 12 min range. Eventually i decided to run 3. Then 4. Then 6.5. The trail i run on is a 6.5 loop. Once summer hit and temps were in the 90s i came back down to 4 miles. But at my peak i was doing 6.5 miles at about a 9 min pace. So a big difference between one mile at 12 and 6 at 9 lol.

DIET: Didnt really consciously change my diet other than i didnt eat foods that made me feel sick when i ran. Just happens to be those foods arent good for you in general. So sodas were gone. greasy foods. I still eat that stuff though. Mostly on weekends and when i dont run but yea thats it.

\### Training

&#x200B;

14 weeks ago I couldn't run more than 3km without stopping. A few years ago I used to casually run 5km here and there, but that was about it. My only other form of exercise was a weekly Basketball game in a social league. I wanted to set myself a challenge, so I signed up for the Melbourne Half Marathon the moment tickets were released and started the Nike Run Club 14 week training plan around June when the dates were synced. Prior to the training start I just tried to run 3-5km when I could. I did all of my training in the morning before work, during peak Melbourne winter of around 4/6 degrees Celsius @ 5:30/6am. I only missed 3-4 sessions due to sickness, or just being flat out tired. 

&#x200B;

About a month into the training I fell in love with running. I suffer from chronic pain and don't sleep very well. I have nightmares on a daily basis and found that running in the morning let me clear my head for the day and gave me some sort of purpose. I learnt so much about myself in the past few months and am forever grateful. 

&#x200B;

I was training/hoping to just finish and do a sub 2:15, but once I did my 20km run before the taper at just under 2 hours I started to toss up the idea of possibly the idea of a sub-2 Half Marathon.

&#x200B;

\### Pre-race

&#x200B;

A few days before the race Hay-fever kicked in, mild fever and a cough. I was slightly worried that it would all be put to waste so took lots of vitamins and rest as much as I could. Luckily, I was feeling 90%  on the Saturday, and being that I live a 15 minute walk from the famous MCG I headed down to the race expo to soak up the vibes for the first time. Enjoyed the excuse of carb-loading and had some Spaghetti Bolognese, Garlic Bread and salad for dinner. Daylight savings kicked in that morning so I would lose an hour sleep but managed to get a solid 6 hours (5/6 hours is good for me).

&#x200B;

Woke up at 5, took a Maruten 160 drink mix, stretched and hit myself with my Massage gun to warm up. Walked down to the MCG at 6:45am (race was at 8) as I wanted to drop my warm clothes bag off, and wasn't sure what to expect. It was so busy! The buzz and excitement was something I have never experienced before. Tossed up if I wanted to run in my singlet or t shirt but opted for the singlet, even though at the time it was probably 8 degrees C, or so. Weather was perfect, sunny with a top of 20 degrees C. I was not used to running so ""late"" and with the sun out, but I had done a few weekend runs a bit later to get accustomed to it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\### Race

&#x200B;

Watched the 10km racers and Wheelchair Marathoners(!) start, and made my way up to the front as I could see the Pacers gathering and decided I would try and stick with the 2 hour pacer and fall back if it was too much.

&#x200B;

Gun went off, and off we go! I had never run with anyone before so it was slightly intimidating with everyone rushing past, weaving in and out and dodging curbs. The pacers were about 1/2 meters in-front of me and though I didn't want to run hard at the beginning I said f it, and took some strides to catch up and lock in with them. 

&#x200B;

I was surprised at how ""easy"" it was to run with a pacer as I didn't have to worry about anything, except keeping pace my being next to them. My pacer was constantly checking her watch for pace, advising drink stations, how we were going and just super helpful in general.

&#x200B;

At about 6kms in we hit Albert Park which had a bit of nice morning cloud, breeze. I was feeling great. I wasn't worried about anything at all. Took my first gel and all is well. Hit 12km took another gel, needed to splash my face with some water but accidentally grabbed the Gatorade and got a sticky face. 

&#x200B;

14km and we're on the final stretch back up St Kilda road and still with the Pacers. This was where we where met with the Marathoners who were on km 30 or so! Bit of a bottle neck as they're smashing through so kept to the left. It was about now that my fatigue kicked in. I kept on reminding myself I could do this, I could see the CBD and knew we weren't far off. Luckily at the same time a lot of running crew cheer squads were in the area, the Army band was playing, families cheering so it was hard to not be inspired to keep on at it. 18km and took my final gel.

&#x200B;

The race finishes with a lap on the MCG and just as we were about to enter the stadium the NRC app advised me I was done; though Coach Bennett advised at the beginning to not use that as a guide, so I knew it was off so kept at it. As the entrance was approaching I thanked my Pacer and let them know I was going to go off on my own and entered the stadium. I could see a time clock with 1:57 something and I started freaking out, wondering if I could do the lap in the sub-2 time so ran as hard and fast as I could. I crossed the line at 2:00:07 super super happy I completed, but slightly annoyed I was 7 seconds off. I then realised this was the gun time, and my actual time from when I crossed the start was 1:59:07 so I nearly broke down in tears of happiness.

&#x200B;

\### Post-race

&#x200B;

My partner was waiting at the expo for me, so I grabbed my medal, bag, and met her outside. A flurry of text messages, people who had seen me run on their morning walk and just general happy vibes from everyone who had run was super nice. Went home, had a coffee and Quesadilla, stretched/massage gun and went straight to the pub where some other friends who had run were there (it was also a cracking day so would've done that anyway). Lots of celebratory drinks, war stories and good times. Booked a massage for tonight so all is well.

562,1569458044.0,"Thanks, dad.","As a kid I walked everywhere, but I never was much of a long distance runner. In college I had a friend who ran an entire mile daily and that blew me away.

Eight years ago my father died. It was a hot September, just like this one. I started running daily within a week of his death. It was the only thing I could do to clear my mind and deal with the insanity. Within a month I was entering a local 5k. Within a few months I found myself running down a country road and logged 10k.

But life kept going. I got a new really busy job and another kid and we all moved to a new state. Running somehow got away from me.

This September I ran my first 5k in maybe 6 years. The meditative feeling came right back. It's amazing to me how the rhythm can come back, even in this older fatter body. Now I'm planning my next 5k and hopefully looking to 10k in the spring.

564,1598974282.0,Ran my fist half marathon today all because the weather was so nice.,"Preface: I just started running again this past fall. I enjoyed it when I was younger, but kind of stopped as I started to work and do college things. Well, last fall my sister gifted me a pair of running shoes because I mentioned I thought picking running back up might help with stress and what not. Started off just doing about a max of three miles about two to three times a week. As the current summer approached, I was doing about five to seven miles every other day. Then comes this morning. I woke up at 6 am and made some coffee while checking the forecast. I live in the Chicago land area and we are having been having really nice running weather in the mornings and evenings this past week (~ mid 60 °F - 70 ° F (15 °C - 21°C)). Today was a nice overcast day with a little rain later. Perfect almost Fall weather! So I popped on some indie folk acoustic to match the fall vibe and started my run. I was planning on only doing seven miles, but when I reached my usual cool down spot, I felt stopping there was a waste of such great weather, so I kept going. By the end of the run, I checked my tracking app and was surprised to see I was at 12.7 miles. I ended up doing my cool down to reach 13.1. I am now writing this, my calves ablaze,  while feeling excited for when the city starts doing half marathons again so I can sign up and run one for real! If you read this far, thanks for reading, and I hope you can have a great run next time you are out as well!

565,1571846417.0,How I raced a marathon all by myself in an attempt to break 3,"40 year old male here.

Thought I’d share a story of my recent attempt to complete the marathon under three hours.

Like many others, I’ve been chasing a sub-three hour marathon for some years. In fact, sub-3 has become something of a fixation to me. My PRs at shorter distances have indicated (when consulting online pace calculators) that I should be good for a sub-3 marathon. However, the marathon distance simply doesn’t suit me particularly well. I’ve always felt more on the speed side and my calves are (and always have been) prone to cramping. But I guess that is part of the attraction, achieving a respectable time on a distance that I don’t seem genetically wired to handle well.

The recurring theme of my marathons up to this point has been calf cramps. Another one is illness. Almost without exception I’ve caught a cold the week leading up to the race. The two marathons (out of seven) where I’ve managed to stay healthy have also been my most enjoyable ones, with one being painfully close to the three hour mark (I missed it by a mere 28 seconds). Last year I caught a cold (sore throat) three days prior to the race. I entered the race anyway, but crashed and burned (walked/jogged the last 10K). So, although my shorter distance results indicate that a sub-3 is within the realm of possibility, I seem to have very little margin for error. A lot of things need to come together on race day (fitness, health, hydration, weather, etc).

After my best running season yet (I’ve been running about ten years), with a solid block of 10K/half marathon training during the spring, where I PRed on every distance from 3K (10:15), 5K (17:40), 10K (37:05), and half marathon (1:22:58) I felt like I was in a good position to move into marathon training for a fall marathon, to finally break 3. I decided to go with Jack Daniels’ 2Q program (41-55 miles/66-89 km per week, although my mileage typically was on the higher end: 90-100km). The program felt like a good fit for a father of three, with only two workouts per week that could be juggled around a bit and all other days just easy running to achieve one’s mileage goal. As rumor had it, the workouts were indeed challenging; two longish runs (15-17 miles) per week with a lot of marathon/tempo pace work sprinkled in. Some memorable ones were “60 min E + 3×(2T w/2 min rests) + 1T + 1E” (that is, a total of 11K at tempo-pace after a 60 minute run) and “2E + 14M + 1E” (22K of steady marathon-pace running). Although difficult, I managed to pull off most workouts as planned. And when I in August, four weeks out from my goal marathon unexpectedly PRed again on a hilly half marathon (01:22:21), I actually started to believe that this time I might make it. At least the capacity was there.

Story was about to repeat itself though. With voodoo-like precision, I started feeling a scratchy throat one week out from the race. It wasn’t particularly bad and I was confident I would be able to recover for the race. However, my hope sank the day before the race when I went out for an easy shake-out run. My heart rate was clearly elevated (about 20 bpm above normal). I toed the start line anyway, loaded with adrenaline and sheer will-power, and managed to do a decent race to about the halfway point before I realized that this wasn’t sustainable (I had started cramping and my heart rate was already way too high). Rather than pushing through, I decided to DNF, as I wanted to have the opportunity to try a backup race I had marked in the calendar a few weeks later. One could even regard this (half) marathon a decent workout for that later marathon.

A few weeks later I was ready and re-motivated to give it another shot. But like some cruel joke, my health went south again the days leading up to the race. I got a persistent cough and decided it was neither worth the effort, money, nor time to travel to another marathon with such poor odds. The running season in Sweden (where I’m from) was nearing the end and travelling abroad to run a marathon did not feel like an option (neither time-wise, cost-wise nor family-wise).

My youth days are over and family life makes it increasingly challenging to consistently squeeze in 100K training weeks. I was doubting that I would ever be able to muster up a training block of this quality again, so I really needed to get this marathon run soon!

It was already mid October and in the north of Sweden where I’m from, that means temperatures around the freezing point. With the dark and cold winter rapidly approaching, it was time to implement “Plan C”. Born out of the frustration of never getting the right conditions for running at my best, and inspired by Kipchoge’s amazing run to break 2, I had been playing with the idea of simply “racing” a marathon on my own.

There is a spring half marathon held every spring within biking distance of my home. The course is a two-lap race around a lake. To get a control measured course, this would be the venue for my “race”. I figured that I would simply run the half marathon, turn around and follow my own tracks back to the starting point to get my 42195 meters.

I was going to wait for a few days to get good conditions to run in (not too cold and not too windy). In about a week or so, I told myself. That night my youngest daughter got the stomach flu. Me and my fiancé were up cleaning vomit and washing bed sheets until well after midnight. I realized that I’d probably have a time-frame of about 24 hours before I was down and out myself. My marathon needed to happen the next day. Although the weather was far from ideal (-3C in the morning with wind chill effect of about -7C) I had to do it. It was going to get a bit warmer during the day (around +2C or so) but still, not ideal.

I biked to the lake and prepared my two fueling stations, one on each end of the lake (about 5km apart). At each station I placed four bottles of sports drink with a gel taped to each. I was a bit worried that the water would freeze or get too cold for my stomach to handle. I wore two watches in case either one would malfunction in some way, laced up my shoes and did some light jogging to the (imagined) start line. I couldn’t help feeling just a tiny bit insane in the light snowfall, waiting for the clock to strike 11, my start time (which allowed for easy calculation of the end time, should my GPS watch decide to act up). “No time to doubt my sanity, let’s just do this”, I said to myself. The clock struck 11 and the (imagined) gun went off. I was on my way.

I had difficulties in settling in with my race pace. I needed to run a 4:15 (or slightly quicker) pace per kilometer, but my first kilometer showed 04:02. Whoa, slow down! The next one showed 04:05. Either I was severly misjudging my pacing or I was in great shape. With my history of cramping, I knew that it’s essential to go for an even pace and not try to bank time.

0-5K in 20:26, a bit “too quick” for my goal which called for 21:15 fives. I settled in to a more conservative rhythm and hit the next 5K in 20:43. At this point I was back at the start and discovered that my bottles had fallen over in the wind. Not ideal from a cramping perspective later on, I thought, as I bent over to pick one up.

I was feeling good, ticking of kilometers like a machine, consistently a bit faster than I needed (around 4:10 min/km). 10-15K in 20:51, 15-20K in 21:00.

Passing the north end of the lake again at the halfway point I looked at the watch: 01:28:00. I was definitely on track. I was just waiting for my calves to start cramping. But everything felt good on that front. I had something of a rough patch just after the halfway mark up until 25K, far enough into the race to be affected by the effort, and with long enough left to know that it’s far from over. Still, I was ticking off kilometers on pace: 20:44.

I rounded the lake for the third time with a 20:44 5K and hadn’t felt any signs of cramping. I was starting to believe that I was going to make it. The next 5K (30-35) in 20:49 and now nothing but a disaster could prevent me from making it. My legs felt surprisingly fresh. I was close. 35-40K in 20:47 and now it was only about 2 kilometers left.

Suddenly I started to feel really tired, but I pushed on for 4:12 and 4:13 on the last two kilometers and even managed to put in an extra kick on the finishing stretch. When I looked down the clock read **02:56:35**. I made it! I celebrated (ever so discretely), took a selfie and a photo of my watch to visualize the memory, and quickly packed up, put on warmer clothes, and biked home collecting my bottles on the way.

It was a wonderful end to a bizarre day. A great sense of achievement. Running the “race” on short notice also proved to be the right decision, as I got the stomach flu myself a day later.

Looking at race time equivalents it is my poorest result, but given the amount of effort put in to achieve it, I hold it at the very top of my PRs.",running

Then after a while it started to become darker but I always run in streets with light so I didn't feel unsafe.

I was passing by a school and there were some other youths there in their 15-17s. Nothing scary.

I continued down the road and then on the street I noticed a big group of men, about 8 guys in the age 20-24. Now I felt a bit unease, but decided to just pretend like nothing and run with a bit bigger distance from them.

As I'm on my way towards them, they hear me coming and glance behind. I became a little worried because I started to feel more on the edge.

And as I'm running past them, I see behind me how a few of them, maybe 2 or 3 start running after me. One of them even reaching his hands for me and now I'm terrified.

I sprint with my last bit of strength and they continue to chase me for about 10s, but I escape.

577,1580143204.0,Accidentally ran my first 5k!,"I hope I've put the right flair. 

Anyway, I started running just before Christmas, doing couch to 5k each week, and ive been trying to get involed with new things and meet new people, since I just split up with my girlfriend who I recently moved in with, I'm basically on my own in a new city.

So a family member who lives nearby knows I'm trying to branch out a bit, and knows I've started running but she must have not been listening at all whenever I talked about it, because I always make sure I mention I haven't run more than 5 minutes at a time without stopping. Because I don't want people thinking I'm able to do marathons or whatever. She took me to join in a parkrun. But I had no idea what a parkrun was besides it took place in a park and involved running.

I was at the start line when I found out we were going to be running 5k and I started to panic a little. I was supposed to be building up to this over 9 weeks! Just a month ago I couldn't run for more than a minute without having to stop. I was sure I'd burn out in the first km and look like an idiot.

But somehow I didn't. I managed to keep running the whole damn way! I would have been impressed with myself it I'd even run half then walked, but I pushed through and didn't stop even once. In the final stretch when I felt like death I took my mind off the fatigue by counting down from 100. It worked. I did it.

It was by no means an impressive performance, I finished about 400th out of 600 runners, with a time of 32 minutes. I got passed by little old men and a few kids and even a guy pushing his baby along lol, but I was so impressed that I finished the full 5k I didn't mind.

If someone asked me to run even half that distance when I woke up that day I'd have declined. No way could I do that yet, it's impossible! But here I am. I'm going to continue doing the couch to 5k because I'm a bit of a completionist but I've decided to go and make the parkrun a weekly thing now.

578,1534333580.0,I came in last.,"I’m reposting this because my first post was deleted for (I’m assuming) not adding flair. 

I ran an 11k on Sunday, and I came in last place. 

Going into the race, I looked at the past few year’s results and knew there was a good chance that I would be in the bottom 5, but I didn’t think I would come in dead last. Turns out this year’s competition was a little stronger than I anticipated. The winner ran 11k in 37 minutes, and I was even beat by a race-walker. But you know what? I actually don’t even care. 

I got back into running in January, after having a baby and gaining 70lbs, and I’ve really enjoyed pushing myself and setting consistent goals. I tend to run around 12 minute miles for longer runs (which 11k is for me); I know it’s slow, but it’s where I feel comfortable right now. My goal for this race was to run it in under an hour and a half and to not have to stop and walk, and I achieved both of those goals.

579,1618666435.0,Getting comfortable running slow,"I had a breakthrough on week 7 of C210K, when you need to start running ~2 miles continuously. I really thought I couldn’t do it, but decided to challenge myself to see how far I could run around my local park, which would be closer to 3 miles. I wound up running the full 3 miles that day, and have been doing the same loop about 3 days a week without walking. I’ll increase mileage when the program prompts me.

Here’s what clicked: yes I ran slower, like everyone advises. But this time I was really focused on starting SO SLOW and sticking with the pace the whole run. If I’m breathing really easy and not breaking a sweat for the first mile, that’s OK — I set my pace for my last mile, not my first. In the past I would try to push myself a bit and then slow down when I was out of breath, but I’d already be pretty gassed out at that point and would often start walking. 

The other thing that’s helped: the hardest thing about maintaining my slow ass pace is not speeding up when other people pass me. Even if it’s unintentional, I realize I tend to do this. I try to imagine a hand holding me back so I keep my slow and steady pace. Also, I do sometimes feel embarrassed by running slower than some people walk. But I’ve started to think: if people think anything when they see me, I hope they think “if this person can run this slow, I bet I could start running too.”

I don’t know if this will resonate with anyone, but for the first time I feel like running doesn’t fill me with a sense of dread because my body can comfortably handle the pace I’m running and it makes me really happy.",running

Is this just me? Anyone else like this too? 

PS- Me posting this is a part of me putting off my stretching for my run today 😂

Editing to say- there is SOO MUCH conflicting information in the comments. With links to studies to back up all the conflicting info too 🤣

2nd edit- Because a few have asked: the reason I hate stretching in this context, is that it’s just boring af to me. In the form of yoga I love it because it’s what I’m CHOOSING to do at that time. Stretching before or after an activity like running or weightlifting because I HAVE TO so I avoid injury is just not my jam. Also, for everyone suggesting I do dynamic stretches because I’d hate it less- my stretches are dynamic stretches before my run and static stretches afterwards. Still hate them. I also foam roll occasionally but probably not as often as I should. I also already do yoga 2-3 times a week but doing it more frequently wouldn’t hurt I’m sure.

I do see a lot of people saying they only stretch after their run but years ago I had a PT tell me I needed to do specific stretches before running or lower body workouts of any kind to avoid hurting my knee again. Which is why I feel the NEED to stretch I guess. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Maybe I’ll test the only stretching after thing since so many of you suggested that.",running

Without thinking much I tell him ""of course I will finish"".


""That's what I like to hear!"" he says with a big bright smile, gives me a fist bump and disappears back into the crowd.


Of course I will finish...but only if I can run.


So I made a deal with myself.


I would not run through pain to avoid being completely disabled or injured and would take all the breaks I needed for as long as I needed them, even if that meant being the last runner crossing the finishing line. 


This change of attitude and purpose towards the race sounds easier in writing that it was in reality as I was still quite emotional at that moment -  running NYC has been a long dream of mine, so I felt I ruined a rare opportunity with a series of rookie mistakes.


I used my phone to massage my legs, and after a long break, I got back on my feet and started with a jog picking up the pace once I felt it was safe to do so. 


The cramps returned every single mile, and every single mile I stopped to rest, stretch, drink and massage my legs. 


At every stop multiple people approached me, from police officers to other first responders and spectators, to check on me, wish me well and share drinks and food. 


With no finishing time to worry or care about, I decided to enjoy the rest of the race, shifting my attention from my watch and from the course, to the neighborhood, the crowds and other runners, and celebrating with them. 


I chatted and shared my remaining gels with a runner on my right who was also struggling and I was offered a bag of ice by a runner on my left, gave a bunch of high fives, sang to songs, laughed at some crazy outfits and posed for pictures, pretty much all the stuff I would never do on race day. 


Arriving at Central Park was awesome, the color of the trees were beautiful and the crowds were wild there, something I will never forget. 


I ended up finishing one hour and 15 minutes later than my goal. 


There are obviously a lot of fundamentals to be learned from this experience, from training to nutrition, so that it doesn't repeat again. 


But the real lesson I got from NYC, particularly from those unforgettable last 9 miles, was to be reminded why I started running in the first place years ago, way before I got lost in pacing strategies, PRs and Strava segments. 


To all the first responders, runners and crowds of NYC 2022, specially to the guy who came to my side at mile 18 and inadvertently put into motion a soul searching journey that got me back to the race, a huge HUGE thank you.",running

587,1626966574.0,Turns out running slower really does make a huge difference!,"I’ve been running regularly for the past few months and have been running 5ks a couple of times per week with the ultimate goal of being able to run a half marathon in the not so distant future. I’m 6’0, 160 pounds, and a type 1 diabetic which has its own fun challenges. 

I did my latest iteration of couch to 5k and finished 2 months ago. Since completing the program, I’ve felt like I’ve hit a wall. No matter how hard I push myself, my 5k keeps clocking in right at 30 min +- a few seconds. And I always am completely and utterly drained at the end of the piece.  It’s been disappointing but I’ve already come so far so I couldn’t be too upset with myself. So I did some research on this sub and after perusing dozens of post the common theme was the same: run slower but run further and you can improve your 5k time. 

So this morning I was eager to take advantage of the sub 70° weather which hasn’t been seen in months, and I ran a full minute slower on my pace. I could not believe how enjoyable the run was !! At no point was I out of breath or counting down the seconds until the workout was over. In fact, I looked at my watch and I had already ran 32 minutes and I felt amazing. I felt so good I decided to pick up my pace and ran the following:

Mile 1: 10:50

Mile 2: 10:53

Mile 3: 10:52

Mile 4: 9:45

That’s right. I had enough in the tank after 3 miles I was able to run almost my regular 5k pace for an extra mile. And by the end of the 42 minute run, I still felt like I could go further, which has never happened before. 

If you were to tell me 6 months ago I would be running for 42 minutes straight I would’ve told you you were full of it. I’ve never had a good relationship with running, but after today I am actually really excited to start incorporating longer and slower runs into my schedule.",running

After that, I had this lofty goal in the back of my mind to run sub-3. But I thought I was too old, and I thought my best shot at it passed a couple years ago. But today, I not only proved to myself I could, but did so convincingly, running a few minutes under 3.

### Training

So, here's the thing. I am simultaneously  always training for a marathon and not training for a marathon. What I mean is, year-long, I'm running as if I have a marathon coming up, even if I don't have one on the calendar. I always have weekly tempo/intervals and long runs. I always am focusing on running further and running faster. Throughout the pandemic, I like most people had no races to run, yet I trained as if I had one in weeks. And I knew I was getting faster with all my mileage. And when I realized CIM was actually happening, I signed up for it. But I did not change how I ran. I didn't focus on it. I just continued how I ran.

Since the pandemic has afforded me a lot more time to run (no commute as I WFH), I upped my running from 45-50 miles/week up to 80+ miles a week. In fact, it was only because of CIM and the need to at least somewhat taper that I finally ended my streak of 80+ mile weeks at 30. And I truly believe it's my high mielage that let me PR by over 9 minutes.

I knew I was getting faster when I completely crushed my old half-marathon PR back in October (1:24:56 -> 1:22:30), even as I had my usual high mileage week (86 miles) that week. And that gave me all the confidence in the world that I could get sub-3.

But, here's the thing. As anyone who's run marathons knows: you could have the perfect training cycle, you could properly rest, probably eat / hydrate before the race, do everything right, and things can still go south during the race. Murphy's Law is always in full effect, and I've had my share of bad marathons. Like I mentioned above, this is my 40th marathon, and I can count on one hand the number of 26.2 mile races where I felt I ran close to my full potential (full potential given my level of training & fitness at the time).

### Pre-race
I stayed at one of the official hotels outside of downtown, which had buses to the start. But... there was a shortage of buses, so I had to wait in the cold for almost half an hour waiting for an extra one to come by. And the bus wasn't heated, the windows wouldn't go up all the way, and I was freezing on the ride to the start. And despite the email saying we could stay on the bus until the start to keep warm, the driver kicked us out.

Luckily, the start line was next to a gas station, and the employees let us hang out inside the mart. I used the opportunity to do some pre-game stretching. At this point, I was already convincing myself I would _not_ have a good race, given how miserably cold I was. But this is normal for me. I'm always full of self-doubt before the gun goes off.

Oh, I should mention that I _thought_ I had a wardrobe malfunction. Well, not a malfunction, but I thought I brought the wrong shorts, since the ones I brought did not have side pockets, which would be where I'd keep my gels (Maurten, if you're curious). But I discovered these shorts had three smaller back pockets that almost exactly fit one gel each. So, a flub in packing turned into a mini-discovery of sorts.

### Race
One thing experienced marathoners always tell you: don't go out too fast. And it's something I've learned the hard way, multiple times. But for this race, I actually did start off relatively slow, clocking in at 7:15-7:18/mile. The main thing I focused on was just staying relaxed and not worrying that I wasn't at the pace I needed to be (6:52/mile for sub-3).

The race gave out throwaway gloves, which I figured I would toss after the start, but I ended up wearing them the entire

I fell even more behind when I invariably had to pee around the 4-5 mile mark. Again, I can count on one hand the number of times I've finished a marathon _without_ needing a potty break.

After the pee break, I felt I needed to make up some time, which I did. And here's where I started my usual race plan. Basically, every race, from 5k to 26.2, my strategy is simple: focus on the person in front of me and close in and pass that person. And that's what I started doing. In a race like CIM, there is no shortage of runners in front of me.

Side note: in my [last race report](https://old.reddit.com/r/running/comments/q0pg2a/smashed_my_previous_halfmarathon_with_a_12232_at/), a Redditor chided me for having such a race strategy. And honestly, I don't completely disagree. It is a dangerous strategy. But it's always worked for me. I need that carrot in front of me to run my best. And that carrot is always the runner in front of me. If I was running this race with very few runners, there's absolutely no way I'd run as fast as I did today.

At the halfway mark, I was at 1:30:35, which was off sub-3 pace. But I wasn't totally worried, because my two(!!) pee breaks accounted for more than a minute, and I was pretty confident I didn't need to go again. And I was feeling very good. Like... extremely good, to the point where I didn't feel like I was exerting that much energy. As you can see in my splits above, I accelerated even faster after the halfway point.

One thing I did change up from all my past marathons: I did not use every water stop. I'm usually very diligent about hydrating, but at the same time, I usually end up with stomach issues if I drink from every station. All told, I skipped about 4-5 stations. And I only used two gels, though I packed three. I mentioned that I use Maurten. They're definitely the most bland gel you can buy, but man, do they work. No stomach issues at all, and for me, they go down VERY easily.

From past marathons, when things fall apart, they fall apart very quickly, and usually around mile 18. But mile 18 passed, and I still felt strong. Then mile 19 and 20 went off without a hitch. And it was at this point I led myself believe not only could I run a sub-3, but I could do so with time to spare. So the decision here was: back off, run comfortably and guarantee I get under sub-3; or push it to see how fast I could go.

There was no choice. I pushed it.

Of course, by this point, legs were getting heavy, so even as I pushed it, I was slowing down a little. But not as much as I feared. Part of it was the crowd, which frankly was a lot louder than I expected, and they totally gave me the energy to push through.

When I finally crossed the finish line at 2:56:40, I raised my fists in the air and... promptly started crying. I'm not ashamed to admit it. This had been such a lofty pie-in-the-sky goal of mine, that to finally accomplish it overwhelmed me. This was the first time I had cried since my mother died 15 years ago. That's how much this feat meant to me.

### Post-race
Not much to say, except that nearly nine hours later, I haven't been able to wipe the smile off my face. And I haven't stopped eating. But I think I deserve those donuts.

589,1617217757.0,I wish there was an app that matched you with another runner so you could talk on the phone during long runs!,"I've lately gotten into the habit of calling people I care deeply for on long runs. My mom will routinely call me on Sunday mornings. At first I would have to call her back, but my running has progressed to the point where I can have a pretty good conversation on those easy, long Sunday morning runs. If im running for more than an hour, I can get two solid phone calls in! ~~Every experienced runner will tell you that~~ there's something about having a good conversation that makes the time fly, more than music or zoning out.

With more COVID and social distancing measures ahead I don't have any running partners. I wish there was an app that matched you with another runner and you could talk on the phone, sort of like a clubhouse meets omegle. You could discuss training, diet, future races, or life in general.

Potential drawbacks: poor connectivity on trails, wind + the elements, safety concern?

Potential benefits: Unlimited!

Edit: Ok guys sorry I generalized. Don't shoot me. Some people hate talking and running. To each their own!

Edit 2: The idea is very polarizing! I guess that's a good thing? I crave community and I do miss talking to more people in a safe, responsable way.

Edit 3: Some people are outright angered by the idea. Lol. I think the app should include an option for therapy. Run and talk to a therapist to help you resolve your anger issues! Now we’re on to something.

Edit 4: Most people hate the idea. But about 20% of you love it! So I’m gonna start thinking about putting an MVP out there. Us “weirdos” who like to talk and run need to stick together. Life is too short to care what other people think.

Final edit: As others have eloquently mentioned, everybody has their own reasons for running. I love the person who called me out for not ""living in the moment"". Not every run needs to be meditative or life changing. Frankly, when I do any run longer than 2 hours I get kind of bored regardless of what I'm listening to. Talking to someone during those long, easy days is a great way to stay engaged. Finally, so many people are acting like it's impossible to run and talk. Give it time and keep training. Also, is it me or has the internet gotten meaner lately? Angry DMs over this? Unnecessary.",running

*2020 I had been going running everyday since the first locksdown. I was slowly but surely getting better and abselutely loved it. I joined a Triathlon group last summer, hoping that maybe when Corona was over, I could start doing it in competition and such. T*

Then just before Christmas my foot started hurting. Not like cramps but in a weird way. I stopped running and it made me abselutely mad! Imagine working out everyday and in the time that I need excercise the most, I can´t. But I tried my best. I did Workouts even though I am not really motivated when it comes to that. (and do you have any idea how hard it is to find a saticsfiying Cardio Workout without jumping?) 

Now finally after 1 1/2 Months my results have come in. When I had sprayned my ankle as a kid, the foot somehow grew together in a weird way. If I put to much pressure on it (which apprently I did), small fractures can spread again. 

So bye bye my dream of one day running a triathlon, bye bye my fricking favourite excercise. I never even got to the point that I could say I was doing it as an actual sport. I was running 6km in 45min. But now every chance at getting better is gone and I´m stuck with going walking and doing work outs.

591,1593881126.0,Report what you see,"Headed out to run this morning at 6:30am.  I went to an area we refer to as “the blvd.” This is a long and a main street in Charleston, WV. Nice area - the paved running/biking area is parallel to the river.   Well I was .18 miles on my run - I see the guy beating the crap out of this woman.  She’s hitting him back.  Her hits were nothing to the pummeling she was receiving.  I immediately turned and ran back to my car and called 911.  Other runners saw this. I gave what information I could to the operator.  Shortly thereafter the police swarm the area (about 5 cars).  I continued on my run but this bothered me immensely.  The fact that I’m an open well traveled area this happens.  I gave their location to the operator but I don’t know if the police apprehended anyone.  This area is also a place where homeless people sleep.  
I only got 4 miles in.  Ithis was supposed to be my long run day. I am truly disturbed by this now.  As a human- my heart goes out to this woman.  Being a female I don’t understand living like this yet I know this stuff happens.  The nerve of this guy too. 
I carry - but not when I run. I’m glad I turned around before the guy saw me, who knows what he could’ve done to me. Usually my husband goes with me but he wasn’t able to today.  I was scared and I just don’t understand what he was thinking doing this.

After leaving the Corps, I allowed my fitness and health to decline to dangerous levels. I thought I had entered the last, sad, and final phase of my life at age 48.

Here, I was taking a selfie with a Hungarian parliament guard officer.

I decided ""No more."" I took back my health last September and in the past 13 months, I've lost over 110 lbs through Whole30 and going Paleo. One month ago, on my one-year anniversary of clean eating, I decided to start running. 

http://i.imgur.com/hNta0tP.png

Tonight's run will be my 12th run in a four-week period. Some of the things I've done differently this time than all the other times in the past 20 years that I've tried to get back into running has been:

* I started at 20 minutes, increasing by 2-3 minutes in duration with each run, finally worked up to 3 miles in under 30 minutes
* Worked on increasing pace 
* Never walked once during a run
* Never pushed so hard that I caused any muscle pain
* Do push-ups before every run

This time, I never got the ""Oh my God, my muscles want to kill me"" pain I always had in the past. After three weeks, I was finally able to run without my legs feeling like they were encased in heavy leather, or like I was running in wet sand. They felt free, easy, and I forgot about them. Breathing is much easier during my runs now, too.

I have a goal of running a 5k in December. Distance wise, I can already (and I do already) run 3.1 miles within 30 minutes. I will be running lots of different 5k's in the coming months afterward (our October/November/December weekends are all booked already).

Weirdest part for me: aside from finding that I enjoy running, is that when I don't run (like this morning, I forgot to set my alarm for 5 am and woke up too late and had to get to work), my legs are antsy. It's like they want to run (which I will do tonight after work). This is definitely a new sensation for me, and I can't say I don't like it.

My goals are to get fit, to be able to run 30-45 minutes without huge effort, and to do the occasional 5k. I also want to remain injury-free. I have a nice pair of running shoes I had fitted for me at Fleet Feet here in Houston after they watched me run on a treadmill and after I tried on what seemed like an endless array of shoes. I wear shorts, socks, and shirts that are incredible. I wish we had this kind of gear when I was a Marine 20 years ago! I also use a pair of Bluetooth headphones and a belt to keep my phone in (I run off-road on trails around the lakes near my house). It's absolutely amazing how technology makes running so much easier and better!

Finally, as an old 49-year old guy, after getting fit and looking at my eventual retirement, I decided it would be a good idea to join the National Guard to finish up my last 8 years of service. I will (hopefully be accepted soon to) be going to OCS to be commissioned as an officer. It'll be 18 months of tough training, but since doing all this running and exercise, I can already pass the Army physical and I'm well within height/weight standards.

Losing the weight changed my life completely, and running has enhanced it. I never thought that would be the case, yet here I am.

\### Training

I started training for this race in December. I was running 3 times a week in my neighborhood. I started out super slowly, then built up a little. Unfortunately, my entire family got the Flu/Covid (yes, both) at the end of January, me, my husband, and our 2 young kids. Recovering from that set me back for 3 weeks, and when I started training again, it was basically like starting over. I started running 3 times a week again, and built up to 4. I did intervals on Tues and Thurs, a long run on Saturday, and a speed run (sometimes) on Monday or Wednesday. The area in which I live is hilly, so that was helpful. I didn't really know much about the race other than it was at the nature preserve, and I had no idea what I was getting myself into. 

&#x200B;

\### Pre-race

I woke up Saturday morning at 5:00 am, had coffee, oatmeal with berries, and a banana. I drove to the race area and shuttled with a bunch of other racers to the event itself. I was chatting with everyone and mentioned it was my first ever half marathon. Everyone was super kind and helpful with advice, and the participants who had run the race before let me know what I could expect. Hills. I could expect hills. They told me there were more hills on the back half of the loop, but hills were throughout. Before the race, I had a granola bar and half a gatorade. I strapped on my hydration vest, had my energy gels, and had my interval timer and audiobook ready to go on my phone. I was excited, but nervous. Honestly, my big goal was to finish. I just wanted to finish the thing. 

&#x200B;

\### Race

The race itself was a trail run which I sort of expected, but I didn't realize how wild the terrain would be. In hindsight, I definitely should have done more research. The course itself wound through the woods and trails uphill and downhill, and the half marathon course was two loops. The first loop went fine. My pacing was good and the audiobook was keeping me company (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, a book I've read a million times so I didn't really need to pay attention to it). I mostly ignored my interval timer and went slower up the hills and faster down, except where there were a bunch of tree roots and I had to go slower. The second loop however, that's when things got dicey. At mile 7, I tripped on a tree root while, hilariously, looking at the mile 7 marker and thinking ""Oh mile 7 woohoo, whoooaaaaa -splat-"" I banged up my knee pretty good. At mile 10 I got sick of hearing the narrator's voice and took out my headphones. It was just me and the woods and the suffering. Mile 11 I sat on a log and cried for a minute, then threw up, and then kept going. At this point I had given up all pretense of trying to make any kind of time goal, I just wanted to finish. My husband was sending me encouraging texts throughout the race, and that was really helpful. By the time I made it out of the woods, the race was over. My husband was in the parking lot with the kids, and my 4 year-old held my hand and walked with me across where the finish line would have been if I finished in time. 

&#x200B;

\### Post-race

When I was done with the race, I thought to myself ""I would rather go through unmedicated childbirth again than do another one of these."" But this morning I signed up for another half in August. As much as it sucked at times (like REALLY sucked), I honestly loved it, I'm glad I did it, and I'd do it again. I lost 25 lbs since starting to train for this, and I gained something extraordinary. At 35 years of age, I ran my first half marathon. So thanks, Santa, for this life-altering experience. This was so much more than a gift.

There is etiquette that says this feat doesn’t give a person the right to go around saying they are a marathon runner. I agree with this etiquette. We need an accepted word or phrase to describe people who run solo.,"There are runners who will never participate in an organized event.  For me, even though I can afford the travel, hotel, and entry fee, I choose to spend my time in other ways.  Running events are motivating and amazing and should my circumstances change I will participate in organized events as well but for now I run on my own and I’d like your help in developing a vocabulary to talk about others who choose to run solo.

I’d like to propose simply adding the word solo in the description of what a runner has done.  Solo 5k. Solo marathon.  Solo century.  For solo runners we can rely on gps for distance and time.  GPS isn’t exactly accurate but it is very close to accurate and we really don’t have anything better for solo runners to verify distance.  Even driving a course by car can be misleading because of turns and lane changes.  Having a category of solo runners won’t take away from the accomplishments of sanctioned runners.  Even though supporting oneself on a solo run can be more inconvenient than the support provided during an organized run the effort to train for a specific date and then make it to the event is an accomplishment of its own.


I feel comfortable in saying I ran a solo marathon to describe what I accomplished without taking away from those who have done the work to finish organized runs. Others should feel comfortable saying they ran a solo 5k, solo half marathon, solo century, or whatever distance they did because it accurately describes their accomplishment apart from the runners who put in the time and effort to participate in an organized event.

It would be nice to know what others think of this.

Edit: Thank you for all the responses. The consensus seems to be overwhelmingly in favor of not worrying about distinctions and that anyone who has run 26.2 miles can call themselves a marathoner. 

I would like to clarify, I don’t care what other people think as it pertains to me. I care what other people think as it pertains to themselves. I have found the best way to deal with fragile egos is to bend like the lotus and let them flow by. Knowing how to speak to people who really care about the minutia is part of letting those egos past as smoothly as possible.

Edit #2. You have restored my faith in humanity. It’s good to hear from so many people who just want to run, or jog, or walk and the jerks can pound sand. 

My favorite running ad of all time is from the find your greatness campaign where the overweight kid is slowly jogging down a country road. Every time I see a severely out of shape person plodding along a trail or road. I send them a silent prayer of hope and encouragement. 

Thanks again, everyone!",running
598,1561931814.0,I ran the most i ever have in my life within this month. 82.5 miles between June 5th - June 30th! I feel fantastic!!,"I'm new to this sub so, forgive me if I'm not posting correctly but I wanted to share my personal accomplishment with individuals that share a same interest because I'm really proud of myself.

**Little background info:**

I've ran for the past 2-3 years casually, on and off, Mostly treadmill running between 1-3 miles with 4 or 6's thrown in once or twice within a year. I've always been a weightlifter gym goer since dropping weight from 280lbs in 2010. I got down to 220-30's and stayed around there until 2015 when I got to 275. I dropped down to 198 in 2016 and have been consistent around 220 until this year.

I started taking running seriously this year because i got lasik in January of 2019. So, i made a promise to myself since I have new eyes. I didn't want to take the surgery for granted, I didn't want to fluctuate between overweight to the border of normal weight anymore which i did since 2011. My diet, no longer feels like a diet and exercising has been a life change, and I no longer want to get skinnier/stronger to look better. I want to become lighter to run faster and longer haha.

In February, I could start exercising again because I had complications during the surgery and needed two surgeries and longer recovery. I weighed around 230lbs, and started running from February-April on a treadmill doing 1-4miles. They were really tough! but I stuck through it. ""It's all in your head"" ran through my head countless times to push me through when i wanted to stop.  Come good weather, around late April I started running outside. I started with 1.75miles around my sub then bumped that up to 2.5, then bumped that up to 5k in June. I weighed around 213lbs at this time. June 5th I downloaded Strava, and continued running the 5k's, they slowly started getting easier on my lungs/heart and legs so I bumped up my pace and started doing two 5k's a day, then started doing 10ks, and today I did two 10k's. One in the morning and one about an hour ago for a total of 82.5 for the month.

It's so addicting. The runners high is unbelievable. I can't get enough of it. Before when i was just starting running it was grueling, in a bad way, it was hard to control my breathing and I felt like dying, Now it's grueling in a good way. It's exhausting, yet relaxing at the same time, It's therapeutic, like a massage. I feel so calm and clearheaded during and after my runs. My lungs and heart feel like they're the healthiest they've ever been. My mood and mental state feel incredible, My legs have grown new muscles all around, and my butt got bigger and firmer lol. Love pushig harder and further shaving off seconds from my pace, going further, and everything becoming easier all at the same time.

The community is fantastic too. when I run at a local park, other runners all say hi and wave, and even today I got a ""good job man keep it up"" from a guy running my way. Totally unexpected but it felt great.

All I want to say is running is awesome. More people should participate.

1k without stopping
2k without stopping
3,4,5k without stopping

609,1567880804.0,I finally ran my first sub 19 5K!,"I am still mind blown by something I thought I wouldn’t accomplish until later in the XC season, especially at the hilly course I ran at today.

Coming into this meet, my PR stood at 19:07 i set a week ago at a flat course but it was hot outside and I passed out on the finish. Starting today it was 60 degrees, cloudy, but a very hilly course. 

Got out hard for mile 1 at 5:50, slightly behind my friend who pushes me. We continued to push each other up the brutal 50 feet rolling hills until mile 2 when I finally passed him coming around with a time of 12:07. That’s when i realized I could pull off a sub 19 if I could kick up the final hill which was an 80 foot monster.

I fought on over the hill and my friend passed me yet again around mile 2.7. At this point, running on E, I began my kick way earlier than I normally do in a sprint to the finish. There was a small 5 foot hill blocking sight of the timer with maybe 70 yards beyond it before the finish. I pushed up the final hill and saw an 18:50 on the clock. 

Somehow, even with nothing left, I put together enough of a last second push to finish with an 18:59.5, earned a spot on varsity, and led the way to my friend’s new PR of 19:07

610,1641006926.0,Running saved my life,"This sounds a bit dramatic, but it’s directly related to why I’m alive today, and why I’m sober.

Earlier this year I was deep into addiction, and I had a heart attack as a result of my drug use. Since I’m still fairly young (34 now, was 33 at the time), doctors said I could reverse the effects of the heart attack, which were extremely elevated heart rate and blood pressure. I would however, have to make some drastic changes in my life. One, I would have to stop using all drugs and alcohol, (obviously), and two, I would have to change my diet, and exercise. First things first, I went to treatment and got sober. 

I moved back to South Philly and joined a sober community and started going to 12 step meetings. I befriended an individual I met at a 12 step meeting (narcotics anonymous), that has over a decade sober and who is a marathon runner. He suggested I start running since it helped his mental health and helped keep him sober. Since I had medical doctors telling me I needed to exercise, I took his suggestion, even though I had no experience with running.

When I started running I could barely run a quarter mile. Using drugs really had destroyed my body. My friend said I should train for the Philadelphia half marathon in November (this was back in august), and I blinded went in and decided to do it. He wrote up a training plan and I adhered to it. Fast forward, and I completed the half marathon with a time of two hours and 8 minutes. It was one of the most profound things I’ve ever done. I felt like I was taking a victory lap through the city that I had used drugs in my entire adult life, that had caused me so much pain and anguish. 

Now I can’t picture my life without running. This summer I’m going to start training for the full marathon in philly in November, and I’m going to finish it. Tonight at midnight I’ll celebrate 6 months sober. I’m really looking forward to next year and what’s to come. I went back to school and now I’m halfway through my bachelors degree. Running has become a huge part of my recovery from drugs, and such an integral part of my life. I’m so grateful to have found it.",running

For a runner, I have a slightly thicker body type, so even if I’m wearing pretty average length shorts, I think it seems as if I’m showing a lot more skin. So, approximately once or twice a week, I have men yelling gross things at me out their windows, honking, whistling, you name it. Today, a man yelled something disgusting out his window while I was out on a walk with my husband. It’s incredibly infuriating of course, but the worst part is how helpless and sometimes scared I feel after these instances. I really have racked my brain about how I could respond (outside of flipping the person off) in a way that could be corrective for that person, maybe to help prevent them from doing that to other women in my community.

And I enjoy all the workouts. The long runs are nice and almost meditative and I could see myself go further when it comes to distance easily (if I just had the time for it).

The shorter all out runs like the mile and 2500m are also fun because you go fast and since its not too far you can keep the speed up and you don't have to ""red line"" for too long. 

But the 5k... I'm now dreading to do the actual race since  the distance is too far to go at a fast pace all the way and you have to conserve yourself, but it's also too short to be a race where you can relax and not go all out all the way...",running

623,1617535306.0,Things I've learned since starting to run a year ago.,"**Benefits**

* Running is *so* good for my mental health.

* I am much more consistent with my sleep schedule because of the physical activity. 

* My legs look so strong now! 

* My walking pace is significantly faster now. 

* I can eat more food and not gain weight. 

* The focused time alone is meditative and stress relieving. 

* Similarly, I feel like I can handle more stress. 

**Surprises**

* Running with snow on the ground isn't awful. It does require caution, though. 

* My butt didn't disappear. 

* Running with a buddy, masked, isn't as bad as it sounded. 

* My performance is affected by things like allergies, my menstrual cycle, lack of high quality sleep, etc. 

* Music can be highly motivating if at the right bpm. 

* My resting heart rate is 5-10 beats lower. 

* Asthma can still kick my ass. 

* My dog is not a good running partner. 

* Running a few hours before bed negatively impacts my sleep. 

**Advice**

* Hats/baseball caps make such a difference in keeping the sun and rain out of your eyes. 

* Stretching/yoga and strength training improve performance by keeping you limber and strengthening stabilizing muscles. 

* Following a training plan will likely produce more progress than winging it.

* Hydration is key. 

* Increase mileage slowly and build in rest as appropriate for you (esp if a beginner runner). Injuries suck. 

* Remember to use sunscreen!

### Training

A little about me. 

\- Male, 39 years old, 5ft 10 (1.78m), 141 lbs (I've lost over a stone during training). 

\- I ran cross country competively at school (ages 11 to 16) but hated track work. 

\- I didn't run or participate in any physical sports or activity then until Oct 2015 - yes, 18 years later!  I trained for the Sheffield half marathon (due in March 2016). Training went well for the 6 months but I pushed myself too hard which led to (what I think) were deficiencies (calories and vitamins) and the doctor saying he wanted me to stop training 2 weeks before the half marathon and pull out - gutted. 

\- I lost heart and didn't run for 6 months, and from Sept 16 to Nov 18 I  I did the odd run every few weeks - I had fallen out of love with running

\- From Dec 18 to March 2020 I didn't run at all - not 1 mile :-(. 

\- Finally in March 2020 during lock down my non running wife showed an interest in the couch to 5k 10 week program which we both did. I bought her a new watch as a gift and a few weeks later I bought myself a Garmin 735xt and HR strap, upgrading from my reliable TomTom Runner. The Garmin programmes and new tech sparked interest, as well as some new trainers, and motivated me to pick up where I had left off in 2015/16. I have trained differently, more cleverly, by running by heart rate zones based on lactate threshold. I'm now currently heading towards the end of week 13 of a 16 week Garmin Connect 16 week training plan. I opted for the intermediate heart rate zone training planning. It was slow at first but my zone 2 lower ranges have picked up in pace and can now comfortably run at 8:15 min miles at a low heart rate. 

\- I did a time trial on the 4th July (week 8 in the plan) as a tester and hit 40:22, and was so close to beating my target of 40 min 10km 

For those interested in training schedules I have gone into depth for a usual day. I'm an early morning runner, alarm goes off at 6am everyday, get dressed, 400ml of water, nothing to eat, wee and poop (mandatory) and out the door by 6:15 without fail. I do not do warm up excercises, I start all my runs with easier paces and build into it. My weekly mileage ranges from **35 to 45 miles per week**.

My weeks have been varied but roughly follow: 

**Monday** \- an easy 45 min run heart rate zone 2 (6'ish miles at 8:30 /mi pace). I usually hit the trails for more hills and challenges, focussing on keeping my heart rate down. + Adriene Post Run Yoga. An afternon  walk with the family usually works for the legs usally covering 3 miles.

**Tuesday** \- Interval training for 45 mins, intervals varied but max out at heart rate zone 4 (6:20 /mi pace) and rest back down to heart rate zone 2. I do these session by doing laps of my local park, which are exactly 1 mile in length. Usually cover off 7 to 8 miles in total as I start with a 1 mile warm up easy run and a 2 mile easy run cool down. + Adriene Post Run Yoga.

**Wednesday** \- an easy 45 min run heart rate zone 2 (6'ish miles at 8:30 /mi pace). I keep this to road/pavement running with a few hills. + Adriene Post Run Yoga

**Thursday** \- rest day. I usally cross train with a mountain bike ride, pilates session or Hiit Tabata session from youtube. An afternoon walk with the family usually works for the legs usally covering 3 miles.

**Friday** \- Threshold/Hills/ or Tempo training for 45 mins, varied but max out at heart rate zone 4 (6:20 /mi pace) and rest back down to heart rate zone 2.  I do these session by doing laps of my local park, which are exactly 1 mile in length, unless they are hills which I use trail woodlands. Usually cover off 7 to 8 miles in total as I start with a 1 mile warm up easy run and a 2 mile easy run cool down. + Adriene Post Run Yoga.

**Saturday** \- My favourite day, easy heart rate zone 2 long run day. My exploration run, finding a 100% trail route and dissapearing into new trails for a couple of hours - I love following the little breadcrumb trail on my watch. The distance has increased through the program ranging from 8 miles to 16.5 miles, I covered the 16.5 miles in 2hr 17 mins at an easy  heart rate zone pace. The recent weeks have mixed easy pace with faster race pace intervals. + Adriene Post Run Yoga.

**Sunday** \- Rest day. A longer 45 min Adriene Yoga stretch session. I may do a family bike ride or walk.

**Training kit/ gear:**

\- Trail: Altra Lone Peak 4.0 (love these!)

\- Speed Sessions: Nike Flex Run 2015 or Asics Piranha SP4 (my fastest lightest shoe)

\- General Easy Run road shoe: New Balance Vazee Rush (now falling apart!)

\- Watch: Garmin 735xt

\- Nutrition: as above 400ml of water, unless its a long run of over 2 hours, I take a handful of gummy sweets and have 2 or 3 per mile (as a treat) and take one High5 energy gel at mile 4 or 5. I do not take water with me as the mornings are cool enough in the UK.

### Pre-race

My usual routine as above, however this time I ate a cereal bar and took a gel on my drive to the track. This time I completely reset my watch to read km and km splits opposed to miles as I had last time. I took out and set up the information I neeeded on the watch as well as setting a pace buddy on my watch to keep pace. A did 2 laps of the track doing an easy slow jog and stretches to get the blood flowing.

### Race

My target was to beat 40 minutes for 10km. I set out strong, maybe a little too fast but maintained pace and by 5km I had beaten my 5km record of 19:42 by 43 seconds (18:59) and a minute ahead of total pace. By km 7 I was struggling. The battle for me isn't the physical fact of doing it but the mental debates in my head, like wanting to stop at 5km, stop for a drink, I need a wee, any excuse to stop doing what I was doing. Pace remained strong, breathing needed to be monitored and kept under control, in through the nose, out through the mouth - you know the basics which can all falter under exertion. KM 8 was a tipping point, I was almost there and pace picked up again - it was mentally easier but my legs where letting me know. Finished and bought it home at 38:37!  

### Post-race

A big drink of water, 2 laps slow jog and stretches and home for a big breakfast. Maybe a Yoga session later today with Adriene.

631,1625993220.0,Why run a 100k ultra - My first 100k ultra.,"Background about myself. 
Almost 4 years ago I used to be obese, and longer than that I was really unhappy with my own life, I was really unhappy with how I was living it, and out of no where I stumbled upon a video named The Why - running 100 miles by Billy Yang. I just had tears rolling down my eyes and I was moved so much both by the passion behind it and the beauty of it. 

Before the race nearly 2 weeks prior I got sick, I got tested via covid and was negative, I only had a runny nose but it was enough to hit me big before the race. For obvious reasons I had no symptoms in the race, and I was completely healthy, but losing 2 weeks of tapering wasn't nice and made me seriously doubt the 100k.

The race Yllä pallas NUTS in Finland

The race started at a nicely 15 C temperatures, It was cold even and I loved it. My plan was to push it harder in the earlier race before it would peak at almost 30 C to cover some distances and avoid some of the fell peaks at hot weather. 

Midnight start 00:00 - 1:37
0-10 KM was really slow as many of the slower runners were up ahead, many of the faster runners got stuck during that time with them simply because the path was too narrow and technical, it was all good they knew that it would quickly thin out and people would give way. the terrain was mostly downhill during this section.

10-25 Km 1:37 - 3:41
I remember so clearly seeing me hit 14 km mark hitting around 2 hours 9 minutes in, and realising I had to separate myself from the much slower group. Soon afterwards I watched one of my most memorable sunrises at around 2 am. rising behind the fells. By around 22 km I really was pushing the asphalt section in which I excel really well at always and overtook a dozen of the runners which lasted til 25 km mark or so.

25-34 km 3:41 - 5:09
My legs were still good, and I still felt like I was doing well. However the thing about my race is that the sun never truly sets down. There are no need for headlamps at all as the light is clear throughout the day, Started off with a small climb but it was mostly downhill again and some parts were insanely steep and you really had to watch yourself.

34 - 50 km 3:41 - 7:50 
Now the real race started for me. at 35 km mark I met with one of the first proper climbs, and I had to power hike some sections, but it was surprisingly flat in some areas of the fell so I was able to run a decent amount, this is were I also smashed my knee up against a tree. Then it was just downhill again. Then around 41 mark we climbed 160 meters in a single km and it was absolutely brutal with all the bugs and mosquitoes eating at you, and the more you struggled the more you attracted them. But that fell section offered the most beautiful spot ever, you saw clearly pallas fell from the distance where the race began from, you also saw Yllä fell where you finish it. The views alone were absolutely gorgeous.
By the end of 50 km mark I was seriously doubting myself and whether or not I was able to finish the race, downhill was starting to Hurt me, and I was just not able to push for it anymore after the downhill section.

50 - 70 km  7:50 - 10:29
How can you pull yourself up when you are feeling the sheer hopelessness of doing another 50k when you already feel tired, you have basically done the first section with fresh legs and you start to doubt and realise how hard the next part is, especially when the first part is the easiest section not only by the course, but also by weather. 
From 8 am it was starting to get really hot, it was already 21 C. People were starting to notice it and even myself. I was struggling to even run at this point, and I knew DNF was coming right up if I didn't pick myself up. So I began listening to music which I knew would help, more specifically I listened to David Goggins and the moment I listened to him all the pains went away and I was renewed with such an immense way that I started bolting after the 52 km mark towards 70 km, even during the big heat that was coming up. 
There is something so weird about the mental state that you can have, and to truly think you have given everything, then finding out so much more within you, its a scary thing to experience because that is when you realise how much you have kept hidden and away. its also something you rarely experience until you really push yourself beyond normal limits of a human being.

70-80 km 10:29 to 12:16
The biggest climb of the day, and certainly one of the toughest things I did in the race, The Heat was unbearable as the rocky fells felt as if they had sucked in all the heat, no shade, no nothing. I saw a lot of runners struggle, and many forced to give up due to their bodies completely shutting down. The climb was over 420+ meters, about 714 meter high peak all in all, to be so exposed to the sun it was pure torture to endure, so I pushed my self even harder in this section to avoid as much of the heat as possible and to get down to the streams where I could cool myself off.

80 - 88 km 12:16 to 13:16
It started off with an unimaginable downhill run that kept on going down from Ylläs fell and many struggled to go downhill, I personally was fine with it but it did cost me my legs eventually as you run a few km downhill with a very steep course, however I was desperate to cool off. By close to 90 km section I hit the last aid station and I didn't really think much, I ate some, and drank lots but I thought I had it in the bags. How wrong I was.

88-94 km 13:16 - 14:23
88 km was so close to breaking me completely, I took pure determination and willpower to power it through, it was the steepest uphill of the whole course and at first I thought my gps watch was mistaken that I had to go up the the steep gorge, I didn't seem to find any markings either. so I went a few 10-20 meters off course only to realise that I had actually go up the steepest part of the gorge, in the middle of the sun and brutal heat. Climbing up those 214+ meters was one of the hardest things I had to do in the whole race. I cannot begin to describe the pure torture it was to go up it, but I did it with the most I had, and speed. By the end of it, it however left me with almost nothing in the tank. As I emerged from the fell I started bolting it soon afterwards but I realised that the heat and everything that it was a bad idea, I took an even bigger toll on me than I could have imagined.

94 km to finish - 14:23 - 14:47
Now it was all flat and downhill sections, the easiest part of the section. I tried running but my legs weren't working. I listened some more music and found a bit of power. People were encouraging me to go on, runners told me to go on, but this one runner that seemed to struggle just like me but was still running made me move again, not just move but run properly. On the last km I sprinted to the finish with this doubt in my head whether or not my right leg would make it to the finish, I was struggling to run. I gave my absolute everything, it was nothing but sheer determination, in that very moment my pains, my discomfort disappeared, in that small moment I felt like I run, not just run but fast. In the end I found a lot about myself. There is definitely a reason why people do ultras, mine can have many but I think the main reason for me is to truly find what im capable of.

It was a beautiful race and im forever grateful that I changed my life to become a ultra runner. 5 years ago I admired the runners here and was ashamed of being obese and depressed, I yearned to find meaning in life. Never 5 years ago would I have imagined to become something like this, it wasn't even in the possibilities, I am living a dream in which I am challenging it everyday.",running

I did my 1st 5km run in late February, doing it in 30:04. Since then i've upped my max distance to a 16km run the other week, and probably averaging about 4 runs per week, incorporating some hill reps and thinking about starting some sprint training since I'm a 190lb (@5'11"") former(ish) powerlifter and fairly explosive.

Fast forward to the other day, and I absolutely flogged myself on the way to doing 5km in 24:41! very satisfying.

Right now it's mostly people in my facebook friends list, but I'm hoping to see it grow and people find other people they can feel comfortable with running this summer!

Edit: wow a girl goes to sleep and look what happens! Thank you for the upvotes, the lovely comments and the award! Thank you also to the one person who felt the need to message me that slow running is just jogging. Seriously you are the reason it's taken me three years to work up the nerve to run with other people. 

I think my takeaway here is that I want to make sure that there is opportunity for people to meet up and run/jog/walk together. Our area has very few local restrictions right now especially around outdoor socialization, so I'm going to see if a weekly outdoor meet is something people will be interested in and then maybe people will pair up in other ways :) thanks again for the support all!",running
637,1607484672.0,PSA: If you have nagging shin splints please get your vitamin D levels checked.,"This may be obvious to some but it definitely was not for me and neither for the doctors and physiotherapists that I visited over the years.

 I have had really bad shin splints for almost 4 years now and I have visited 2 doctors, 2 physiotherapists, a podiatrist and an osteopathologist  and none of them ever asked me to get my vitamin D levels checked. I don’t know if they just assumed it was an obvious thing to check or not. 

It was only until I learned about the importance of both calcium and vitamin D for bone healing in my classes did I consider getting a blood test to check my vitamin D levels. Lo and behold I was extremely deficient and needed a stronger dosage prescribed (I do spend time in the sun my body is just not as good at absorbing it). Not only are my shin splints almost gone now but also other bone bruises that I have had are starting to heal rapidly. I injured my tailbone last year and it never healed until after I started taking the supplement. 

So yeah before you try anything fancy like massages, exercises and that weird gun used to accelerate bone healing (i used that as well) please get a blood test and make sure you have high levels of calcium and vitamin D. 

Tl;dr : if shinsplints are nagging and not healing then check your calcium and vitamin d levels through a bloodtest before visiting a physiotherapist.

Edit: Just wanted to say this does not fix shin splints but it heals them. So if you have an issue with your running form and it causes shin splints then not only do you need to heal the injury but also fix the mistake with your running that is causing you the shin splints in the first place ( better shoes, shorter strides, training less, better foot landing position...etc). For my situation I had already fixed my running form a while ago but the shin splints never healed because of my low vitamin D. Also I am not dark skinned (slightly tanned) and I live in a relatively sunny part of the world.",running

I especially want to give some recognition to those who take the time to host one of the reoccurring threads each week.

Speaking of reoccurring threads, I thought it might me time to refresh some of our threads they seem to be getting less attention this week.  Many have been around for a long time and have helped in the past (when the sub was much smaller), but it is probably worth checking on any possible changes.  Participation can vary each week so we can't strictly look at comments/upvotes, but a few have caught my attention that may be time to retire (or at least swap with something else for awhile).  **Note:  I do not want to remove any posts posted by users, only those by Automod.**

The ones that seem to have the least participation are:

* [Weekly Training Thread (Sundays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search/?q=%22weekly%20training%20thread%22&restrict_sr=1)

* [Li'l Race Reports Thread (Mondays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search/?q=Li%27l%20Race%20Reports&restrict_sr=1&sort=new)

* [Lurker's Wednesday (Wednesday)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=lurker+wednesday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)

Granted, with all the cancellations, the Lil Race Reports has very little content, but that one will come back when races do.  The Lurkers thread is also fills a need, but could be swapped out with something else too.

I've added in a [Social Saturday](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search/?q=social%20saturday&restrict_sr=1&sort=new)  post to give users a place to promote their social media/services/products since some great running-related posts were getting removed due to Rule 3.  I'd like to see if anyone else has any other ideas for new posts.

Since the Wednesday Gear thread is very popular, I thought about having a dedicated shoe weekly shoe thread since we have a large amount of shoe posts that usually involve a lot of discussion, just asking for similar shoes to something already worn or a review of one that user is looking at.

So, let's hear it.  Have any good ideas for some threads?

641,1587055005.0,What is the best run of your life?,"What is the best run of your life?  This does not have to be a race.  It has nothing to do with pace, distance, or total time.   What is a run that you just remember as ""the best run of your life?""

The best run of my life was in 2007.  I believe it was early September, I believe it was a Thursday.  My wife and I were kid free at the time.  We would come home and run after work (because we had time).

That day was one of those where the weather was just perfect, there were very few clouds in the sky, the temp was warm (but not hot), and there was a slight breeze.   We had friends coming over in about an hour and I decided last minute to go for a ""quick"" run.  Nothing would have told me that I was about to have the run of my life.

I stepped out, plugged my headphones, hit play, and took off.   As I moved into my run, everything felt awesome.  My legs had full power and felt fresh.  No aches, pains, or stiffness.  I had this energy that to this day I can't explain, but if I wanted to push the pace, my body would just go.  There was no pain, no resistance.  It was just like, ""You want to go faster?  Okay, no problem.""As I really settled into my run, the sun was starting to set, painting the western sky with this orange hue.  Up next on my playlist, my ipod started to play Pink Floyd's ""Shine on You Crazy Diamond"" full length Parts 1-->9.  What happened next I to this day cannot explain.

Suddenly, I am running near this open space that gives me a unobstructed view of the trees and the sunset in the distance.  The music is building.  The sun is setting.  The breeze is flowing over me.  Then Gilmour's guitar just hits me.  I can't explain it.  I honestly feel like I am having an out of body experience, for lack of a better word.  I know my body is moving, but I feel nothing.  I no longer feel like I am in my body.  All I can feel is the wind and the music.  I just see the sun on the tall grass moving in the breeze.    I don't know how fast I'm running, but I certainly feel like I am just moving, all I know is I feel amazing.

When I got back, I told my wife that I felt like that was the best run of my life.  Almost 13  years later, I can say: it was.  I have had some great runs, but nothing touches that evening's run.  It was an out of body experience, it was a runner's high, it was....special.  If I could give someone a hit of how that felt, I think everyone would want to run.  I know I sound crazy describing it and how my run felt.  But man, I think about that evening every time I hear the intro to ""Shine on..."" and I get chills.

I ran over 4000 miles in 2019, so it's not like I'm a stranger to a lot of miles, but this was a bit different. You can see my runs here: [https://smashrun.com/craig.luchtefeld/overview/2020/1](https://smashrun.com/craig.luchtefeld/overview/2020/1)

Here are a few things that I learned:

* This may seem like a crazy feat, but honestly, I'm nothing special as a runner. It took a while to build up a foundation that would allow for this, but if you put enough time and energy into something, over time, you can do some pretty remarkable things.
* This streak did not make me a better runner. I'm no faster and no more fit than I was before it. In fact, one might argue that I just threw away 30 days of actual, legit training. I ran different routes each day, but my pace was largely the same, most runs were done at the same time of day, and I live in a place without a lot of varied elevation. So, yes, I did a thing, but it didn't make me more fit, increase my VO2 max, lower my heart rate, or anything like that.
* Habits and setting priorities are incredibly powerful. A streak like this wouldn't have been possible without habits and setting priorities. Stubbornness, grit, determination, or whatever you want to call it comes into play as well, I think. There have been days where I ran through snow, ice, freezing rain, lots of wind, and downright cold weather.
* While habits are good, you need to watch out for when a goal like this begins to control you vs. you controlling it. I was compelled, at times, to keep this going because I wasn't in total control. That's not a good place to be. This is the land where addictions, self-destructive, and unhealthy behaviors can be born.
* I love listening to podcasts. I couldn't do the miles that I'm doing without listening to podcasts. I've picked up many new podcasts in the last month, just to keep things interesting. I listen to running podcasts, technical podcasts, science podcasts, political podcasts, a few podcasts that I'd say are just uniquely human, etc. If you don't have a partner to run with and like talking/listening on a run, podcasts are a great source of learning and entertainment!
* There's a big difference in training performance, however, between listening to podcasts and listening to music. If I switch between a podcast and music mid-run, there's a big difference in the way that I can perform.
* I could tell, in a few of the runs,  when my performance ""fell off a cliff"". I'd start a run with pretty consistent miles with a pace of 8:55/mi or so and, 3/4 through the run, I'd drop into the 9:30/mi range and even some miles closer to 10:00/mi. That's slow for me. The level of effort felt the same, but I was slowing down a lot. Thankfully, 24 hours of rest was often enough to get back into a more normal pace, but there were days during this streak where my body definitely needed a break. Had this not turned into a goal, it would have been very wise to rest.

Bottom line: you can do just about anything if you put enough time and energy into it. I didn't necessarily do this for any particular reason other than to see if I could, but there were times when I knew that it wasn't the wisest thing for me to continue. I did anyway, though. And even though I'm not a better runner for it, I didn't mind doing it. I ""only"" ran 10 miles today, so I'm breaking the streak on purpose. :)

Finally, I very much enjoy reading all of the stories that y'all share - I especially enjoy the first race stories or the stories of getting healthy - just the general excitement is so much fun. Keep it up!",running
644,1653569293.0,PSA: get your iron levels checked! Just came back to running after a 2 month break and ran my best 5k time in ages. Thanks to iron supplements !,"Thought I would share this as a friendly reminder to get your iron levels checked by a doctor if you are an always tired, pre-menopausal, female runner. 

Earlier this year I was struggling. For months on end - no matter what I did, my times would just not get faster, and even felt like they were getting slower over time. And some of my runs just felt SO tiring, I would feel absolutely terrible during them, and take days to recover.

I'd also just been feeling fatigued in general (and have probably been for years without really noticing tbh) so went to the doctor to get my iron levels checked. My ferritin (iron) was extremely low, almost undetectable. 

I was prescribed high dose iron supplements and stopped running, as I needed to give my body a rest. Exercise places a lot of demand on your body for iron, so I reduced my amount of exercise while I built my iron levels up (my main hobby is actually climbing so I prioritised that in my schedule over running for a while).

Anyway, I went for my first run in 2 months today, and finished a 5k at a 5:21 pace - and it felt EASY! The only reason I didn't go even faster was because I thought I shouldn't try too hard on my first run back. And I know 5:21 probably doesn't seem fast to a lot of you, but I had been STRUGGLING, with a 6:10 pace before the supplements. Like I was just wrecked after every run and I thought I was just unfit. It's actually mind blowing too me how much I have improved, even with a long break, just by increasing my iron levels. 

So yeah, if you are a female runner, feeling tired all the time, and don't think you are getting enough iron, highly recommend you see a doctor to check. Could change everything! 

Should note as a disclaimer however: don't just take iron supplements without seeing a doctor though - they can be dangerous if you don't actually need them.",running
645,1561821877.0,Reminder that it's okay to cut a run short,"Today, I stopped my run earlier than expected. I was shooting for an easy five miles but stopped a little after mile three. Now, I live in the south so I'm no stranger to hot summers. But the heat combined with a general feeling of weakness caused me to cut it short. 

&#x200B;

At first, I was a little frustrated with myself. Then, I nearly passed out in the shower. So I cut my shower short too and had a snack and water with an electrolyte tablet added. Although I normally run fasted on the weekends, I realized I probably just didn't have enough water + food yesterday.

650,1583870528.0,Tonight on my run I saved a stranger,"Today on a run I was faced with one of the most difficult situations I’ve ever had to deal with. 

I was on a run with a friend after work, and we ran past someone who looked like they needed some help.

Without disclosing the specifics, the person was stood in a place and position that indicated that they were considering ending their life.

My friend and I ran a few yards past the person and looked at each other as if to to say ‘something is not right here’. I immediately turned back around and approached the person, without really having any time to think about what I was going to say.

I opened the conversation by asking the person if they were ok. The person burst into tears. I introduced myself and asked the person their name. I told them that I was worried about them and I wanted to help. I asked them if they would like to walk up the path with me to sit down on a bench (I was concerned with where the person was stood) - they refused, and told me they were ok and to leave them. I said I didn’t want to leave them when I knew they were feeling upset, and I asked if there was anyone they would like me to call (I noticed the person was wearing a wedding band). The person said there was no-one I could call. I told the person that I didn’t know how exactly they felt, but that I had also been through this (I have), and that it will get better. The person kept saying sorry and I told them that there was nothing to feel sorry about; their bad feelings were valid.

I managed to slowly engage the person in conversation by asking them if they lived locally, if they had been at work (they were in their work clothes), where they worked, telling them where I lived and worked, etc. Mundane questions to keep the person talking and distracted, letting them know that I cared and that I wanted to help.

Whilst this conversation was happening I was frantically signalling a phone symbol to my friend behind my back. As neither of us had a phone on us (something which I will absolutely take out with me from now on), my friend eventually got the hint and ran back up the path to find some other people with a phone, and dialled through to the police.

The police arrived after maybe 10
minutes and took over. My friend and I waited at a large distance and eventually the police managed to lead the person to safety. 

I really hope this person gets the support and help they need to get better.

There is no right thing to say in this sort of situation, but approaching someone to check if they are ok, and trying to engage them in simple conversation, can save someone’s life.

Edit: 

Thanks everyone for your comments. I am just a regular runner who assisted a stranger when they needed some help.

658,1610436221.0,Longest Run I’ve Ever Completed,"Yesterday afternoon I completed my longest run I’ve ever done (outside and not on an electrical). I know it’s chump change compared to be many runners, but I did 8.06 miles (completed in 1:15:36), and it felt great!

I’m in my late 30’s, female, and have had a lifetime of mental health struggles. Back in October, when stuff with the election was gearing up, I just couldn’t take it- so I hit the pavement. And I’ve been running at least four times a week, consistently since. I’ve always been active, and sometimes too much at certain times in life. But for the first time ever, I’m doing things the right way. I’m fueling my body with nourishment (not starving it like I used to) and it just feels really good. I feel so lucky to be celebrating all the things my body enables me to do...and the healing it brings through that movement. Also, it’s really nice to notice the strength I’m gaining, rather than being hyper-focused on any changes to my body as being a bad thing. 

I get a lot of what feels like judgement from my friends who are still struggling with their eating disorders- and then even guilt for not adjusting my diet to optimize my running from the folks on the, “healthy” side. But you know what, I just keep lacing up my shoes, stretching, going outside and finding my happy place. It truly is so amazing. (Besides, I’ve got my therapist to whom I’m held accountable, and am completely transparent with- everyone else can think what they want...because in the end, it’s all projection. I’m the healthiest I’ve ever been in every way possible, and I own that with pride! And the three years I waited before returning to high intensity exercise!!!)

I have a treadmill at home that I’ve run on for the past year and things have been great! I’ve gotten my 5K time down significantly and life was grand. The last 6-7 weeks though have been rough. I’m pacing at about 30-40 sec / mile more than normal and I’m EXHAUSTED at the end of it.

661,1562586057.0,I finally got diagnosed with asthma and my mile time dropped by 3 minutes,"My entire childhood I desperately wanted to be good at sports. I was always put off by my inability to breath while exercising. I always attributed it to being out of shape (yes, even when I was like 8). 

After college, I took up jogging. I took great pride in finally being able to run- conquering a lifelong mountain for me. I trained and ran 2 half marathons. I ran for years, but my mile time consistently stayed in the 11+ minute range, and even that was a struggle.  

I finally said, ""enough is enough."" There's no way I'm still out of shape after 5 years of consistently working out. Got tested, and sure enough I have asthma. Treatment gives me access to 600 mL more of air at any given time- probably even more while exercising. 

I never knew breathing was supposed to be this easy. 

I ran another half marathon after treating my asthma. Even with less dedicated training I improved my PR by over 30 minutes and broke the 2 hour barrier. 

While I'm thrilled to finally have an answer and solution to my problem, I'm also sad that I waited so long to ask. It sucks that I spent my whole life thinking that I was just lazy when it was actually a legitimate (and treatable) medical condition. 

Moral of the story. Don't be an idiot like me. If you think there's something wrong, talk to your doctor.

**Edit**: in case anyone is coming here later and has questions-

I mainly had trouble breathing while exercising. Couldn't take a deep breath, felt like a fat man was sitting on my chest, wheezing, and a looooong recovery after exercising. Outside of that I did have some tightness when it was cold or humid outside, excess phlegm and sometimes random coughing, and my colds always seemed to end in bronchitis. I also have no known allergies, which is also a common trigger for asthmatics. 

Everyone's symptoms are different and if you're having trouble breathing, it's worth asking your doctor about. While I ended up having full asthma, exercise induced asthma is also miserable and deserves to be taken seriously. 

I also recommend slowing down and watching your heart rate while running, you could just have started to fast too soon and haven't given your lungs a chance to improve their aerobic capabilities. 


**How I got diagnosed:**

**Tldr- went to pcp, they gave me a quick acting inhaler. Then I got a referral to a pulmonologist for actual testing- that's where I was diagnosed and prescribed a maintenance inhaler.**


I started by talking to a primary care physician, who prescribed me a rescue (levalbuterol) inhaler. When that helped improve my symptoms, I was referred to a pulmonologist. They tested my lung function (basically measures the amount of air your lungs can take in and out) before and after asthma treatment (they gave me albuterol). 

They take the results from that test and compare to your expected capacity (for age/weight/height/gender) and compare the results of the pre and post treatment. If you have significant improvement post treatment, you likely have asthma. 

Afterwards I was prescribed a maintainance inhaler (in my case, symbicort). I take it 2x a day. It takes 2-4 weeks to completely build up in your system. If the maintainance inhaler is working for you, you shouldn't need to rescue inhaler (though you should still keep it with you). Once we establish the correct medicine and dosage, I go back once a year to evaluate its effectiveness. If its exercise induced, you might just stick with the rescue inhaler. 

**For those wondering if you have asthma**- I can't promise your mile time will improve after diagnosis. What I can say is actually breathing is amazing and it makes exercise less daunting. 

If you feel like your lungs aren't filling up, you're wheezing, breathing is painful, and/or your recovery after exercising is much longer than those around you it could be asthma. 

It could also be something else (COPD, vocal cord dysfunction, allergies) or being out of shape. A doctor can help get your the right answer. 

The good news is they all have treatments that can improve your life. And yes, even knowing it's just being out of shape can help and you can work on that as well.  

Good luck and happy breathing!",running

**Pre-race:**

I'm a 38 year old guy who sits at a desk all day (CPA). I ran my first marathon last December and have been absolutely hooked since. I tried to sign up for Napa in March but got injured (because I'm stupid and I decided to hit a PR in the half marathon during a taper week). After getting back into training following tax season I set my sights on running Santa Rosa in August, Sacramento in December and revenge tour in Napa. Really condensed schedule, but whatever chemicals my brain released crossing the finish line last time, I was chasing harder than most Meth addicts.

During training this time my tibialis anterior really tightened up on me on my 20 miler which was pulling on a ligament in my knee. I was decent at resting it, but probably not as good as I should have been. Working with my PT we got it as good as it could be and all taped up on Friday. If not for that, I'd have been as confident as one can be going into a marathon (which is to say not confident at all, but knowing I was as ready as possible). It tended to warm up after mile 2, so my goal was to feel it out a bit and let adrenaline take me until I could gut it out across the finish line while hoping it didn't explode.

**Race Day:**

Last time around I got about 15 minutes of sleep the night before, so I was stoked when I woke up at 1am and realized I had gotten about 4 hours of sleep! So stoked that I couldn't fall asleep again. No worries, infinitely more rested than I was going into my first one and so much stronger. You got this. 

I eat my bagel with peanut butter, take my Advil and Tylenol and go about getting some things ready. Race starts at 6:30, and I'm out of things to do at 4:30, so I just kinda lay down in the bed and try to relax and not use any energy. I wake up with a start at 5:15 surprised I fell asleep again and a bit mad that I'm now a bit behind, but we're staying positive, still miles ahead of last time.

I hadn't been entirely sure what my goal was going to be between hanging with the 5:20 pacer or going for 5 hours. My knee feels ok, but I can tell I'm gonna feel it once I start landing on it, so I make a prudent decision to make best friends with the 5:20 pacer. My last time was 5:35, so that's still a PR by 15 minutes.

I brought my wife, my 3 kids and my parents with me on the trip in a couple rooms so I could attempt some sleep, but there was no way the kids were going to be up and ready in the morning, so my dad drops me off at the start line and I promptly find the 5:20 pacer. He tells me it's $5 per person to run with him. I ask him if I can pay extra for him to carry me for a couple miles. This is gonna be fun.

**Course:**

Absolutely gorgeous. Run starts at the downtown courthouse, goes through wine country and even through a winery building at one point. Some rolling hills, but nothing crazy, I think about 250 feet of climbing total. You head back into downtown and finish right where you started.

**Race:**

Now a 5:20 time is about 12:15 per mile, 5 hours is about 11:25, so I'm somewhat surprised when pacer guy starts off and I see my watch telling me were at about 11:15 pace. Fine, fine, whatever maybe he has more walks in his rhythm. I start out with him, but slightly behind and very conscious of my heart rate. My max is 182 and my usual runs are 140s when I'm at a really comfortable pace and 150s when I'm pushing a bit and 160s when I'm going harder than I can hold for long periods of time.

First mile I'm about 10 feet behind him, but heart rate is 137, so all is good. He's gonna walk any time now. 2nd mile, no walk. Interesting, but I'm sure this guy has a plan I'm about 30 feet behind him and heart rate is a little higher than I'd like, but we're ok and I can absolutely hold this pace if I want to. Mile 5 comes and goes and this guy ain't slowing down and my heart rate gets into the 150s. I'm 60 feet or so behind him, and I come to the conclusion that if this guy has a plan, I don't like it. It's my race, I'm gonna run it my way, let's back it off a bit here. 

I slow it down a bit and we hit some rollers, all is well, heart rate is good, we're well ahead of schedule for 5:20. Knee is warmed up, and whenever I feel it I tell myself that I'm going to enjoy this pain and I want some more (I had watched a David Goggins video the night before). Somewhere just before mile 10 I see my whole family. I slow down, give my 2 year old a kiss and my boys (8 and 5) a hug and we're off. I didn't expect to see them until the finish line, but they popped up on the course to hype me up another 4 times!

Halfway point comes and goes, smooth sailing. At some point around 17 or 18 I pass the 5:20 pacer who is walking, but he has no one around him. Very nice guy, loved talking with him but I've decided not a good pacer and I'm really glad I didn't stay with him early. Mile 20 comes, I see my family again and I'm so far ahead of my pace last time I start doing math on if I could walk the rest and still PR, but I'm feeling strong. I know a lot of people say the last 10k is the second half of the race, but I've yet to feel that. The miles slow down a bit, and I'm tired, but I record a quick video telling my family how much I love them and how easy this last 10k is gonna be and to watch out for me crushing the last couple miles. I pick up the pace a bit and by mile 24 I'm passing people left and right which just hypes me up more. I throw up at 10:03 on mile 26 and I round the corner and see the finish line. Is it silly to sprint to the finish line as the 621st finisher of 718? Sure. Did I do it anyway? [100% had to!](https://youtube.com/shorts/bEFQfdj2Vms?feature=share) My sister-in-law who got me into marathons now calls this my signature finish line sprint. 5:08:28 almost 27 minutes ahead of my first marathon!

**Post-race:**

I was a little worried that like a drug addict I'd always be chasing that first high and never getting it. I have to say that this one felt just as good. I crossed the finish line, gave high fives to all the volunteers, hugged my whole family and just sat in a glow of my own glory (in the shade of course) while eating a snow cone. My knee is hurting a good bit today, but I'm enjoying every bit of this pain. It reminds me of what I've done and how far I've come. Couldn't jog 15 minutes a year ago, I'm out here with plenty left in the tank after a marathon. Next up CIM in December. 5 hours or bust!",running

672,1663285355.0,"I'm training for a marathon, but I run a 15+ minute mile.","I've run 3 half marathons (between 2:45 and 3:30) and now training for my first marathon, which wouldn't be so daunting except for the fact that I will likely be running it close to 7 hours. For those you who are truly slow runners, is there anything you do differently? I read that any run over 2 hours is just going to increase your likelihood for injuries, but pretty much any run over 8 miles for me is going to be north of 2 hours. I'm up to 11-12 miles for my long runs and I'm at 3 hours. Is there anything I should do differently in my training considering some of my training runs are going to be 5+ hours long? I'm so worried about injuries, but even more worried about not finishing this race. I've got a little under 3 months to go.

Edit: I’m not asking for advice on how to run faster. There are several reasons why I’m not fast, one of those reasons that will be corrected with a surgery next year, but the other which may never be corrected. 

I’m asking other people who train for marathons at or around my pace for advice on preparing for the 5+ hour race. 

I’m also not asking for your opinion on whether or not I should run a marathon, but to those of you who have told me I should give up on this one, thanks for the extra motivation.

Some of these comments have shown me exactly why slower runners don’t feel comfortable in this subreddit. Way to belittle people who are trying to better themselves through exercise.

673,1596197928.0,One-way Runs,"Most of the time, I’m running from my house and doing a loop of varying distances. Thankfully, I live in a place where there’s a lot of variety in terms of where I might want to go. 

Today however, I did something a little different. I got a ride from my housemate on their way to work in the early AM, and ran back home from there.  Something about being in a somewhat unfamiliar area, while having a destination to reach, made it a lot more motivating (and a bit of adrenaline) than a typical loop or out-and-back.  

I think part of this ties into how on runs which start and end at the same location, in the back of your head, you know you can turn around at any point and make it shorter -  whereas with a point to point, you have a minimum distance you know you must cover if you ever want to get home. To me, this changes the psychology of the run a little bit, and makes it more exciting!

Have you ever experienced this, or felt differently about point to point runs?  Some of the famous marathons of the world follow this format for example.",running
674,1600053283.0,Ran my first 10k and my first under 20 5K.After 3 years with some help from this group,"Back in 2017, I had severe depression and was unable to cope up with anything. I don't remember how I started running but I progressed a lot over the last 3 years. Coming from being unable to run a single mile, to running 6 of those without stopping. Since last 2 years I have always wanted to run longer distances and shorter distances in lower times. Since the start of 2020 I have been running daily(almost) for last 9 months. I got to my first 4mile,5mile and finally to my first 6mile. Pre-Lockdown (About March)  I was able to run a sub 21(20:19) 5k on a treadmill with 1-2% elevation. But since my gym closed down I was forced to run outside on concrete road which hurt my legs initially. After practising 2 months, I was able to go back to finishing a 5K in about June.  After that I used go down daily and just try to outrun my last timing. It was a bad bad idea, I was lucky to not get injured as I was told but I was somehow able to break the sub 20 barrier at 19:45 5k. I shifted my focus onto 10k after that but about a month ago, I had this problem :[https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/ia3pe4/how\_to\_mentally\_fight\_the\_discomfort\_while/](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/ia3pe4/how_to_mentally_fight_the_discomfort_while/)

and some very helpful tips from random strangers u/nnnude, u/[luckyj714](https://www.reddit.com/user/luckyj714/) and u/[Haku\_Champloo](https://www.reddit.com/user/Haku_Champloo/), massively helped the process. This was a turning point and I realized in my bid to run a sub 20 mins 5k I was forgetting to build my endurance for longer runs. So I started running longer distances and slowly. I reached a 4mile after almost 5 months at 7:45 a mile ( from my average of being between 6:30-7:30 a mile) . I was able to finish a 10k running at 8 min a mile (7:53 to be precise) but I had to stop in between. But as I was slowly building the endurance after 4 weeks of failure to cover the distance, I decided to change my strategy. Rather than preparing myself mentally to think about the distance left, while running, I prompted myself to think about the end goal that is the 10k mark. That shifted my focus from constantly looking at the phone for the distance to practically not think about running. The motion came naturally to me. I was just running and nothing else. The outcome was a 7:02 a mile 10k finishing in 43:39. The very fact that I was able to complete the run was staggering. The fact I of all people was able to do something I considered difficult was staggering. I had never even imagined myself being able to run above 4 or even 5 mile, let alone the entire 6.22. This run gave me something I didn't have with me for so long: Self Respect.

Even in the toughest of periods, when I did not have any hope, I had running. I have lost 17Kgs since 2017 and become lean. This year amongst others have been the hardest for a lot of us. Especially bad for many of us. People losing everyday, but at the end of the day when you complete a run with the distance you had in mind (or more) you won the day, and that means you have the ability to fight the next one. If someone like me who has been cheated on, been called incompetent  several times, decimated mentally because of my job  and just not have any prospects whatsoever has the ability to endure a 44 minute run at 7 minute a mile (almost 14kmph) , then I (and especially anyone else reading this) definitely has the ability to kick 2020 in the nuts and just walk away while it's on the ground. The fact that you are able to run any distance at any speed whatsoever is a proof of the fact that you can do anything. And if I have a shred of doubt I cannot do something I will be focusing will be annihilating that completing my first half marathon and my first sub 18 5k.

TLDR: Had a shitty life, started running towards a goal of 10k , got some help from this group, ran my first ever 10, found  the courage to face problems and I hope you do too.

676,1602557223.0,"On this damp, windy, misty evening in Philly, I (25M) ran my fastest 5K ever! Despite gaining 30 pounds, I beat my prior record set in May 2018","I wasn’t planning on beating any records tonight; in fact, tonight was my first time running in almost a week after taking a break due to prolonged muscle soreness. Plus, it was extremely misty and pretty chilly this evening. When I set out, I planned on running the two miles to the gym from my apartment, working out at the gym, and returning home.

Despite running for the first time in a week, my first mile felt effortless! I was able to keep a steady pace through the inclines and declines of that first stretch. I reached the Schuylkill River Trail shortly after completing a 8:23 min mile. Once I entered the trail, I only improved my time—I was able to run a steady 8:14 min/mile through miles 2 and 3. I decided to run up the ramp to the South Street Bridge as I saw it coming up, and proceeded to turn left towards Graduate Hospital. Finally, I ended my run at 25th and South due to reduced visibility, as I wear glasses.

When everything was said and done, I had ran 3.15 miles at an average pace of 8:14 min/mile. This turned out to be my fastest 5K ran since May 22, 2018, when I ran 3.22 miles at 8:42 min/mile. My time improved to a record-shattering 25:55 5K time, down from 27:57 in 2018.

This may be a relatively small accomplishment relative to what others have done, but it’s huge for me! I’ve gained about 30 pounds since setting the last record. Despite gaining weight, however, I’ve been running a LOT better over the course of 2020!

To avoid telling a long story, here’s the TL;DR:

-I lost 104 pounds between early 2016 and mid 2017, going from 300 (the highest weight of my life) to 196. I had previously been obese throughout the vast majority of my life.

-Between mid 2017 and late 2018, I gained 76 pounds, but slowly—I didn’t notice how bad it was until I had to start wearing some of my old clothes from my 300 pound days.

-I decided to work hard to lose weight again. Between late 2018 and March 2020, I had dropped as low as 227. I thought that 2020 was going to be the year that I’d fall below 200 pounds again.

-The pandemic shut everything down. I’m 253 at last check. I’m starting yet another weight loss campaign now that I know I can safely run.

Hopefully, this will be the first of many victories that will not only guide me to lose the weight I need to lose, but also prepare me to run in my first race! As soon as it’s safe, I plan to register for the Broad Street Run!",running
677,1409666604.0,People mocking me on my runs? I don't care anymore,"This is my first post here and I thought I'd share a success story about my run last night. 

  For some background, I began running at the beginning of summer after finishing my second year of university. Exam stress had resulted in my piling on the weight to the point where I would be considered very overweight. 

  After I returned home and the exam stress faded away, I realised how unhappy I was with myself and especially with the way I looked. I vowed the next day to start exercising, not only to lose weight but because I'd read it helps anxiety. I suffer from social anxiety and it's something I'm desperately trying to get rid of.

  The next day I began walking - as fast as I could - halfway up the mountain. Some of you may be thinking I 'jumped the gun' here, why didn't I run roads or public paths? The reason is, I get nervous simply walking by someone on a pavement. The thought of running past someone, fat jiggling and sweat pouring, was unthinkable. At least the mountain path would be isolated.

At first, just walking halfway up that mountain would kill me, I was so unfit. But as the weeks progressed, I started to run. Each time getting further to the top without stopping. Fast forward three months, I can get up and down that mountain, plus an extra 3 miles across the top (~5 miles altogether). I may even be able to run further, but I haven't tried yet. 

This brings me to last night. I had put off my run too long and it had gotten dark. It was too dangerous for me to go up there but I couldn't skip a run. I decided to take the plunge and run a 5 mile route partly across the canal and road. About 3/4s of the way into my run, I passed a large group of teenagers (15/16 year olds). Immediately they started calling abuse and I just wanted to stop. Then, to make it worse I heard fast steps behind me. It turned out that one of them had started running and had slightly overtaken me. They continued to mock and I felt worse as this guy had overtaken me and we were approaching a hill.

At this point, I was about to stop. I couldn't deal with it. But all of a sudden something snapped. I was doing this for myself, to change. With that, I smiled and shook my head at the group behind. I turned to the guy to my left and pointed to the top of the hill. The pretender by the Foo Fighters came on and I bombed up that hill (mountain runs helped for that) The guy to my left disappeared and profusely stopped running. I continued at that rate the whole way back, feeling on top of the world.

So I guess this post is not only to share my story, but I also hope it helps people who want to run (or who have just started) and are worried about other people perceiving them negatively. Remember, you're doing this for yourself. You want to actively better yourself, (be it lose weight, more focussed w.e.) so don't let people's negativity stand in the way of your goals.  
 
EDIT: I never really thought that this would get so many comments. So I'd just like to say, thank you everyone for the kind, motivating words and advice. I will continue running riding the success of passing through my first mental barrier. I just hopes this post helps other people who may be starting running/overweight/mental disorder to not give a damn about criticising their efforts to be better.

Yesterday I did a 4 and a half mile run with an average pace of 9:50 per mile. I've been running seriously again for a few months now and this is a pretty typical pace for me. 


Then I stumble upon an article talking about running form. My coaches taught me some stuff. Try to keep a tempo of 3 steps per second, keep your hands like your holding a potato chip you don't want to break, minimize horizontal rotation with your arm swings. Yet, my entire running career I've been running with my back straight with good posture and I'm nearly 30 now. The article told me to lean forward, almost hunch a little, and have your belly button slightly angle downward. So I give it a try. 


Now today. Same time of day, same route. Average pace? 7:51 per mile. And I felt like I was putting in the same amount of effort into my run. It's totally wicked.

685,1629851992.0,Please take a run for me,"Running was always my main form of cardio. I ran at 3 in the morning, through bitter cold and under the blistering sun because I looked at it as a form of self care, like brushing my teeth or eating my vegetables.I remember getting sick and being taken to the hospital by an ambulance (not for running related reasons), and the doctors remarked how strong my heart was and asked if I was an athlete. I maxed out the run on my PT test in the military.

Cut to last year, I injure my knee, which was already creaky, and can’t run. I felt my mental health deteriorate. The past year I worked on myself physically and mentally. Recently, I felt well enough to try running again. Figured I’d take just a few strides out in the woods to see how I felt.

Then I didn’t stop. I felt like I was flying over the terrain. I didn’t want to stop; I remembered this was my happy place. I ran the whole 3 miles back to my car, after a year of limping around, months being none-weight bearing on the injured leg, and generally settling into life as a cripple. I decided it was now time to start a running routine and build myself back up.

After my first excursion, every step felt like agony on my knees; I have severe genetic arthritis in addition to my previous injury. Regardless, I didn’t want to ever stop. I felt  true freedom running through the woods. But I had to stop; I have a manual labor job, and am currently hobbling around with a brace to do it everyday. I can’t do anything that will jeopardize my ability to go to work everyday. So, the running is back on hold for me. 

I remember reading a story about an old man who suddenly is transported back to his youthful body. He took off running, lifting his arms pretending he was an airplane taking off, galloping around until he exhausted himself. I remember reading it and thinking, ok buddy, running isn’t that great. After my recent experience, I understand how freeing it truly is to do something you didn’t think you’d ever be able to experience again. I even stretched my arms out, like the old man in the story did, and took off running, and I felt free as I galloped down the trail. 

I’ll share another story I read, about a boy who was confined to a wheelchair. He watched acrobats at the circus one afternoon, and marveled at them and tried to emulate them, and he realizes he can’t and never will be able to do what they do, through no fault of his own. He sees other people, perfectly healthy people refusing to walk far and stuffing themselves full of junk, and he grows bitter. They could do what the acrobats do, or at least learn some tricks, if they tried. They have a fully functioning body to make it happen, but they won’t, out of gluttony and sloth (I think this story was one of those kids things warning against being lazy, but can’t really remember). He is overcome by his bitterness and anger. 

So. . . I guess my point is to be happy for ever step you take, even when you don’t want to get out there and put one foot in front of the other. There is someone else out there that wants to be able to do exactly what you’re doing, and they physically can’t. 

Well, I guess I’m done preaching. I feel myself getting depressed again because I’ve reached the point where I have to accept I can’t run, at least right now. I think we forget how amazing it really makes us feel when we’re just doing it to get our cardio, or worrying about our mile time or pace or whatever the fuck people obsess over. I can’t run, but I know the majority of the people reading this sub can, and I humbly ask that you remember why you started, and above all else to enjoy yourselves next time you hit the trails or pavement.

687,1615493121.0,How to protect yourself from aggressive dogs as told to me by an animal control officer (hint: it's not pepper spray),"Hi guys! I know a lot of us have had run-ins (hah) with aggressive dogs and I'll assume nobody wants to get attacked, chased, or killed. This recently came up in a [discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/m29g5y/thoughts_on_shooting_a_warning_shot_next_to_a_dog/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) over at r/CCW (concealed carry weapons) after a post showed an undercover officer having to fire at a dog that was attacking his mother. People (rightly) mentioned that firing at a moving target can be very difficult and could possibly endanger others, not to mention that there are substantial barriers to (legally) accessing firearms in much of the world. I suggested pepper spray as a good alternative (which I know a lot of us use) and learned that it's not nearly as effective on dogs as it on humans. In response to my asking what *would* work well, animal control officer u/Feyrbrandt responded as follows:

>Animal control officer here: we STRONGLY suggest not using pepper spray, the primary component that makes it burn is capsaicin which doesn't effect dogs anywhere near as much as it does people. 

>Plus just being in the general area after PS has been sprayed pretty much guarantees it'll get into your eyes/lungs and you'll be more incapacitated than the dog.

>This isn't to say it's useless and don't ever use it, but I've definitely seen dogs intent on attacking that get a face full of spray and don't stop at all.

>I swear by just having a simple long walking stick. When dogs get into this fixated aggressive mindset they don't think or differentiate between you as their target and what is in your hands. So either having a stick planted upright in the ground in front of you for the dog to attack instead of you has saved my bacon personally multiple times. And it's also great as a weapon that dogs recognize and will keep their distance from.

>And when all else fails nothing is better than a plain old fashioned knife because dogs are incredibly good and taking you down to the ground and that's where they win 9/10 times. I don't suggest folding pocket knives, unless you practice a LOT to know how to pull it and open it one handed while highly stressed.go for the eyes if you can, or the jaw muscles if they have you in their teeth because I've seen a dog take a bullet and still refuse to let go until it bled out.

>And as a side note TASERs are actually pretty good too, the literal shock to their system seems to snap them out of their attack mentality, and the sight/smell of one arcing definitely spooks them.

I thought I would pass this along because a lot of us rely on pepper spray to stay safe when, in reality, it is not very effective on aggressive dogs (obviously still great for aggressive people). Further, this post focuses on tools/weapons that work well but there are behavioral aspects to dealing with dogs that are not mentioned here that would still be helpful. And, of course, situational awareness is key. Please do your research and use/do what will work best for you and your circumstances. Stay safe and happy running!

TL;DR Pepper spray is not great for use on aggressive dogs. Walking sticks, knives, and tasers work best according to an animal control officer.



**Edit:** To those of you mocking the advice in this post, please remember that not everyone has the privilege of a safe neighbourhood or a treadmill or gym. I get a lot of you don't need it, but there are plenty of people that do. Please be respectful of that. The risk is real for some of us.

>According to a study from the Center For Disease Control (CDC), approximately 4.5 million dog bites occur in the United States each year, and 800,000 of those bites result in medical care. The U.S. population is approximately 328.2 million people as of 2019. That means a dog bites 1 out of every 73 people.

**Update:** From u/Feyrbrandt

>If you wanted to add anything else then I also always tell people to never run from a dog, and if it is coming at you aggressively to back away slowly while facing the dog, speaking loudly and angrily but not screaming, and keeping your arms spread wide to make yourself look bigger.",running
688,1591131548.0,"Today, I ran for BLM. I intend to run the distance of the Selma March over 5 days.","In 1965, Martin Luther King led a march of between 300 to over 25,000 people over the course of five days. It took three marches to sustain the safety of followers in that time.

My heart hurts for the black community, and like many others, I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out ways I can support. I've joined peaceful protests and set up recurring donations to BLM and intend to donate to my local Freedom Fund, but I know that there's more that can be done.

Our community is mobile, encompassing most of the local neighborhoods. I urge runners to show support by brandishing supportive messages over the next run. Show the black community that they're welcome, and that allies are always present. We have the ability to spread peace and inclusion through something we do each and every day.

With today being the first day, I intend to replicate the distance marched from Selma to Montgomery. I'll be running 12 miles a day for 4 days, and 6 on the last. If you can't run that far, that's okay. Spread your support in your local communities. The running community can be a beacon for change. I challenge everyone to run for a cause, and to be both peaceful and safe.

689,1617276308.0,The difference structured training makes,"I started running one year ago today. Until December, this was just 3-4 runs per week, usually no more than 5km with the occasional 10km thrown in. I started with the goal of getting my 5k time as low as possible by the end of the first month (April 2020).

My first ever 5k took 30:46, not Terrible but not great. By the end of that month I was down to 25:40, and by the end of June I was at 22:01 still with this rather formless training, and eventually I fell off of running and stopped enjoying it, as well as I stopped improving. 

At the end of December, I signed up to a half marathon at the end of next month, which I am currently training for with a structured plan. I have been running 5 times per week since the first week of January, usually hitting 40-45km as opposed to the 15-25km I'd do last year, as well as having specific paced workouts, doing hill runs and speed work, as well as a regular long run. 

The difference this has made has been night and day. Since december, my times on all distances have just kept falling, with me setting the goal of sub-20 5k by my one year anniversary, and I want to run under 1:40 in my half marathon next month (I believe I can run somewhere close to 1:35, but it's my first half race so I'm not setting myself too high goals). 

Last night I went out to hit my sub-20 goal, and I smashed it. I ran a 19:25, after an 8 hour shift of work, at 9pm, in the dark, cold and wind of winter-springtime Scotland, and it has been the proudest I have ever been of my running. I finally feel like I can say I am a strong runner. 



My main goal with writing this, is to say how surprised and also ecstatic I am that having a structured training regimen makes such a huge difference. There is a night and day difference, not just in my speed but also my endurance and strength, as well as my enjoyment of running.",running

I started running for the first time this year in my life(41F, overweight). It wasn’t easy. The part of world I come from, women don’t normally run. I do an average of 8-9 miles/day. This includes a mix of walking and running. 5-6 miles of running and rest walking. I try to do it 3-5 days/week. The best I have been able to do is 15min/mile. Sometimes people who walk briskly can overtake me. Most of my route is uphill and my average is 16-17min/mile.

While this experience has been enormously empowering, I haven’t lost any weight since April, haven’t been able to improve my speed. I try to change my route if I see a brisk walker as I feel embarrassed that I will lag behind them.

Am I chasing a mirage and should look at something else that will have show some results?

Three takes:
1) You can’t outrun a bad diet: I do calorie count and do intermittent fasting but not with as much discipline as I should—will work on that. Will do research on C25K and work on it.
2) Do what works for you and is fun: I will work on it and update. Someone said that everyone is on a different journey and that is so profound!
3) So many of you shared your stories and that helped and inspired me so much! I have taken screenshots and my husband ordered a coffee cup with some of them on it! I can’t wait to have that in front of me. So thank you.

Second- once I was walking up the trail I was congratulating myself and taking note of the scenery and the cute pups and the fresh air and my music and all that I felt grateful for that wasn’t the running itself.

Third- As someone who needed to take a few months off, I don’t have much of a base so I didn’t track any pace or distance or set any goal except to be out there for thirty minutes!

698,1618081729.0,"One year of running everyday, what I have learned.","Like many people my running got a lot more serious during lockdown 1.0 and I decided to try and run everyday for as long as I could. Today marks 1 year of running everyday and coincidentally would have been my brother's 41st birthday, who sadly passed away from COVID in December. I'm still calculating my final figures but I've run well over 2000miles including 5 half marathons (1:27 PR) and a full marathon today (3:27 PR).

Here are the most valuable lesson's I've learned:

1. The runs you feel like doing the least can be the most beneficial. By far my most difficult runs were the day of my brother's death and his funeral. I don't mind admitting that I shed a few tears as I was running but on completion I felt I had achieved something he would have been proud of.

2. You can run in any weather conditions but windy days are shit.

3. A run of any distance at any pace is better than no run.

4. I hadn't really thought much about mental health but running has become so important to mine. My favourite runs are when I don't worry about time or distance and just enjoy the feeling of being active.

5. Sometimes you have to be selfish, managing work and family commitments often make it difficult to get a run in. I decided that I would run at least 30mins a day and fit it in whenever I could.

6. Don't ignore nutrition and hydration. If your running to lose weight don't give into temptation and reward yourself with that extra treat. My weight has stayed fairly stable but over the last 3 months when I've made a conscious effort to improve my diet I've noticed a significant weight loss. Easier to not eat the calories than to have to burn them off.

7. Running with friends also helps to distract you while you rack up some miles.

There are probably more but time to celebrate with a few beers!

Happy running.",running

Not only did I thoroughly enjoy it, but it also beat my usual avg split time by about 0:35. Such a great run.

Then I get back home. Ever since I moved back out to the suburbs, I've been leaving my door unlocked when I go out to run, so that I don't need to carry a key with me. Except apparently this time, my old city boy instincts kicked in without me realizing because I can't get in the house. Okay, don't panic; the back door is usually unlocked. Nope. Finally I turn to a window that is fortunately *always* unlocked. The thing is that for a 6' dude, wiggling your way through a window isn't the easiest task. Once I'm through to my waist, I kind of need to get my knee up to the window ledge to crawl the rest of the way, and that my friends, is how I just pulled the ever loving shit out of my hamstring.

I made it into the house and didn't even attempt to stand. I just collapsed onto the floor. I was laying there in pain on the floor for the last ten minutes. Fortunately it doesn't seem to have been too serious because it has since subsided quite a bit. Still doesn't feel great but it's not the feeling of a thousand razor blades in my leg like I had before.

So I wake up late, jump in my gear and head out to do 10 miles. Everything hurts, head, legs, feet, heart...
I slow to a walk at mile 2 and get ready to quit. Just turn around and walk home. So I sip some water, eat a couple of sports beans and decide to run to the end of the block. Then just to the end of the next block.. then just to go a bit further until my legs give out.

This was special for me (43/F) because it was 8 years to the day since I rang the bell and finished chemotherapy for a very aggressive cancer.    It was my third attempt at a marathon, having been foiled twice by a respiratory illness and an injury.  Although I am registered for the St. Petersburg Distance Classic, I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to make the date as I have family relocating here right around that time.   I decided to chance a virtual run and if I couldn't do it, I'd try to make it to St. Pete.  I was on week 13 of my 16 week training plan, with my longest run being a miserable 18 miles.

I strapped on my Garmin around 1 p.m.  It was chilly, windy, and rainy and I feared that would cause me not to finish.  However, I think it had the opposite effect as I never got hot and did not sweat like crazy (I have hyperhidrosis so this is a real concern in Florida). My heart rate stayed in the 150s max, which also helped.

My initial plan was to run on the roads, even though I mostly trained on trails, because I figured it would be faster.  However, I got bored at mile 3 and hit the trail only to discover it was flooded and I had to turn around, costing me precious time.  From that point on, I stayed on the pavement and within 3 miles of water at all times.  Around 10 miles in, I realized that I had the opportunity to hit my goal, so I decided to go for it!  It was much easier than I would have predicted, as my last two long runs were truly terrible.  I never hit the wall and by the last mile and a half, I felt a bit like I was floating and I thanked God for giving me this opportunity to run this race as I know so many others who are diagnosed don't get this chance and it was certainly nothing that I did to make it this far.

I was all smiles at the end!  I was soaking wet and my shoes were making a squishy sound the entire time.  I couldn't believe I ran a sub 4:30... for me this was the ultimate prize.

718,1669241056.0,The importance of strength training for runners,"Long post warning! TLDR at the bottom

I’ve noticed a trend on this subreddit that I disagree with. When I’ve seen people asking for advice on how to get better at running, the responses generally fall along the lines of: increase weekly mileage, slow down and do more miles, etc. Sometimes folks will ask if strength training will help them improve, and I feel as if the general consensus here is that it won’t. I want to change that!

Disclosures: I’m a physical therapist. I only have access to publicly available resources (google scholar and pubmed). This isn’t a formal lit review or systematic analysis.

The evidence I found on my search: One of the most comprehensive things I found was a great meta analysis from 2017, a meta analysis from 2010, and some more recent randomized controlled trials 2016-2020, which continue to support the conclusions of the 2017 meta analysis by Blagrove et al “Effects of Strength Training on the Physiological Determinants of Middle- and Long-Distance Running Performance: A Systematic Review”.

The conclusion of the study:

Whilst there was good evidence that \[strength training\] improves \[running efficiency\], \[time trial\], and sprint performance, this was not a consistent finding across all works that were reviewed. Several important methodological differences and limitations are highlighted, which may explain the discrepancies in findings and should be considered in future investigations in this area. Importantly for the distance runner, measures relating to body composition are not negatively impacted by a \[strength training\] intervention. The addition of two to three \[strength training\] sessions per week, which include a variety of \[strength training\] modalities are likely to provide benefits to the performance of middle- and long-distance runners.

In my profession I’m very focused on injuries and rehab of injuries. So I wondered what the evidence might support in regard to strength training preventing injuries.

Currently there is strong evidence for two approaches to injury prevention: reducing weekly mileage and reducing training errors. The first seems pretty obvious: stop running so much and it won't hurt to run. But that won't make you a better runner. There is good evidence for eccentric strength training when it comes to treating tendonitis, but no primary prevention studies have been performed in runners- according to the article by Fields et al  “prevention of running injuries” in 2010.

According to Field’s et al: on average, 40-50% of runners will face injury in any given year. Both this review and a paper from Wilk et al in 2009 state that there are two main extrinsic factors that determine injury risk: training error and prior history of injury. Training error could be a drastic change in weekly miles, a change in running surfaces, or increasing frequency/intensity too quickly. Some intrinsic factors were also noted, such as having flat feet and different leg lengths- but these were weak factors compared to the extrinsic ones.

Some studies from the past couple of years examined the effects of foot strengthening on injury rates- it reduced them. But, a cohort of 720 runners at the 2020 NYC marathon who participated in strength training prior to the race showed no difference between control and strength training groups. A few studies (elite teenage soccer players and 5K runners) looking purely at performance metrics supported the theory that strength training improves performance. 

When I take courses/seminars for continuing education and learn from a physical therapist who works with professional runners, like Matthew Walsh, there is a big emphasis on diagnosing weaknesses and strengthening the muscles responsible for breakdown in form. The idea that strength training might not be helpful in the prevention of injuries seems unfathomable to me. Yet, the literature is mixed. Why is that? I think it’s because it's difficult to know what to do as an average recreational athlete and the human body is insanely complex. What works for one person might not work for another. 

TLDR: Strength training improves running efficiency, time trial, and sprinting speed and this is well supported by current literature. If you are serious about improving your performance you should implement strength training. Evidence is mixed in regard to preventing injury. I believe that in the future we will be able to say that strength training reduces injury- but the research isn’t there yet.",running

721,1639332092.0,🎉🎉1st Half Marathon Completed🎉🎉,"Hi All,

Today I ran a half marathon distance! 

I began running in July 2021 as a slightly overweight 42 male - 80kg at 5ft 10.5in. 

I changed my diet completely as I was eating so many carbs and sugar my dad bod was in full flow!

I work at a desk all day and did no exercise so knew I had to change my lifestyle. I was unfit. 

I started the NHS UK “couch to 5k” plan listening to the podcasts, running 3 times a week. It took me 8 weeks to do that. 

I didn’t know what to do after so just kept adding 10% for a while and doing that 3 times a week before increasing it again. 

I got to 10k and then did a 11k in 50/55 mins. I didn’t know whether to keep going distance wise or focus on speed at 5/10k. Someone suggested a half marathon training plan and thought they were mental. After a week or so I figured why not. 

I was using cheapish ASICS Gel Contend 5 £50 for most of it so in the last two weeks treated myself to ASICS Novablast 2. I also bought some compression tights and thermal compression tops, snood and gloves to cope with winter climate. Still on the hunt for a cheapish jacket. 

For the last 8 weeks I’ve followed the runners world 2 hour half marathon training plan but also skipped a week as I wanted it done by Christmas. I still have 2 weeks to go and was planning on doing the final half marathon on Christmas Eve but not sure I will after today. Maybe I will but at a slower pace!

Anyway I ran the distance today at 1 hour 49 mins and I’m very happy with that. For a break down here’s the [Strava Link](https://strava.app.link/6wN1i5nVVlb)

I think I’ve found a proper hobby I can continue with to make sure I get my exercise in and not sit at my desk all day eating too much chocolate. My wife and kids think I’m having a mid life crisis and am now too skinny but overall I’m very happy with my progress. 

Thanks to all the info here that I’ve found very useful and to Vlad Ixel’s strength and training videos.

Today is exactly 3 years from the day I started running. I couldn't do two blocks because my chest hurt. Today I ran 20 km and returned home without even perspiring or doing things as soon as I arrived, there is literally no fatigue 

But the important thing is not just feeling good physically. Change your diet, your habits, your way of thinking! Running became a lifestyle that I only look back on and see beautiful memories, I love it, I feel like I need it more every day, it's great! I don't even believe it when I see my self from 3 years ago see it without doing anything, today in a month I can run 400km and it feels incredible, the feeling that at least nobody in a 4 km radius (in my case, I live in a small town) can run like me and many other satisfactions is amazing

Please be encouraged to try running, your life will be better in all aspects, and much more when you put aside the search for a better body, because believe me, that soon becomes totally secondary.

Postscript: if you want to know why I started running, they invited me to play a soccer game, I had such a bad time, everything hurt and the next day I tried to run with a friend but it didn't last two blocks the next and I went home and wanted to abandon everything.

The next day with nothing to do I started to see rocky for the first time without thinking about it, and nothing ended, I felt super motivated and went running, I did 300 meters without stopping and returned to my house, and well I was adding day by day and I'm here today, I didn't stop

 When did I start: Men (22) - 76kg - 166cm 

Today 3 years later: Men (25) - 55kg- 166cm 

I know this is not an inspiring story and that I have read in this subredt many best of all of you, but I felt happy and wanted to share my achievement! Hope you have a beautiful week

723,1578532721.0,I'm not a runner!,"This is a true story.

I met my wife 12 years ago at age 50. On our first date she told me she was a runner. On our third date I clarified the situation. I told her ""I know you're a runner. I'm not a runner. I'm never going to be a runner. Don't ask."" I made this very clear. 

I'm not an athlete or athletic but did what was necessary to maintain fitness. I could never run to save my life but I did use a lot of stationary equipment.

Roll the clock ahead a couple years. She asks me if I know of a good charity. Well I jumped at this. The Firefighter's Burn Treatment is an absolute gem. (Just retired last year after 34 years in the fire service) She says great. I'm setting up a work group to run The Bluenose half and we'll use this to raise funds for that charity. 

Roll the clock ahead a couple days. ""BTW, we're all set up to raise money for your charity, what are you doing?"" Whaat...my life flashed in front of me as  I pictured a big old fish grabbing onto a hook and realizing he was done. She then tells me I could walk the half and raise money.

Okay. I can handle that. That's what I'll do. ""Oh. Bye the way, Running Room just happens to have a half marathon walking clinic for the Bluenose."" I felt the hook set a little deeper.

I go to the first session and it's a bunch of ladies, most a bunch older than me. They do have hope for me though because Walking Dave will be in the clinic. The first walk I meet Walking Dave and he tells me he's a speed walker. WTF is that I ask like an idiot? He fills me in and I blurt out that I'm a pretty damned fast walker. Man that hook is getting really tight now.

Over the next few months I learn real humility from Walking Dave as I am not a really fast walker. I also set the damned hook so far that it's never coming out. You see Dave has walked the Bluenose FULL marathon in just a shade over 5 hours and I'm now fully captured.

Roll the clock ahead to today and I have completed a 2:13 half walking and graduated to running to the point where I love it much more than my wife does. I train for marathons without actually running the races just because I can. I have run 29 k in freezing rain and completed a marathon with a ""feels like"" of almost 40 C. All summer I walk the golf course and run the roads and I feel like I'm 25.

Every once in awhile I'll tell my wife I'm headed out to do a run and she just deadpans me ""But you're not a runner.""

If you're thinking of starting to run or intimidated by the idea of running, just go for it. If I can be inspired to run, anyone can do it.",running
724,1571273019.0,Running saved my life,"And I mean literally. If you want to take a gander through my post history you'll see it's not pretty. I was a full blown heroin addict for about two years, and tried countless times to quit with no success. Every time I put down the dope I was left feeling empty. I used for the last time in May of 2018, and what I did differently this time around is that I took up running. It started out by being coerced into coming to summer practice with my high schools cross country team, and I instantly fell in love. Running is the only thing that I've found that gives me the warmth and happiness I desperately sought in drugs. I wasn't fast by any means, but I trained hard from the beginning. I ran my first 5k in 23:18, and kept training throughout my senior year until i got down to 11:26 for 2 miles. Over the summer I found a new goal. I'm currently training in an attempt to walk on to my universities cross country team sophomore year. It's a long road and it's going to be hard work, but I know I have it in me to do it, and I've accomplished much harder things. This week I ran 28:36 for an 8k. It's crazy how much improvement I've made over the past year in so many ways, and my love for running has only grown. Obviously I can't give the full credit of my recovery to running, but it's sure as hell helped me on days when I wanted to throw in the towel.

728,1608769138.0,I. Miss. Running.,"Hi, my name is flamingcrepes and my last run was October 3. I thought I was handling the pandemic well, and it turns out it was mostly (probably only) because of running. Here comes my pity party...

Backstory: I’ve had knee issues for almost 10 years. I finally decided to go to an orthopedist this year (before pandemic times, therefore I ended up dealing with drs offices during, yay). Pain would show up the day after exercise, and be pretty awful, stairs were a nightmare. MRI in February. 

Cartilage was gone. In both knees. Cortisone didn’t touch the pain. Nothing. I was told it was a miracle cure, but whatever. Orthovisc was administered in mid/late June. By the first week of September, the pain was back, worse and starting during runs. Doc sent me to a different doc because he can’t do a MACI procedure (cloning some of my cartilage, growing it and cookie cuttering it into place). Wait a month for new doc, and he says, “I only do replacements, you don’t need that.” Awesome, I waited a month for that?!?? 

Miraculously, new new doc had an appointment on Friday (this was Monday) and I got some more PT prescribed. Month later, surgery is planned. On the 28th, I go under. It might be an arthroscopy to gather a shred of cartilage to clone, it might be a realignment of the patella. All depends on the cartilage situation or lack thereof. 

I’m a mess. I miss running soooo much. It is a lifeline. Life is literally darker. Even walking causes pain. Running gives me a sense of power, gives me so much energy, it’s life. 

All this to say, please wish me luck? May I be back among your ranks soon. Run on, and do a quarter mile for me!!

ETA- Thank you all soooo much for the support! I did just get an elliptical, so that’s definitely in my future. However, the up/down motion of bikes is killer on the knees. Stupid knees.",running

I think what has changed from the past is that I am no longer worried about “fast” times. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized I don’t have to be hyper fixated on being this machine of an athlete. I used to beat myself up for being slow.

I am not fast by any means. My fastest mile time lately has been around 7:45 on a treadmill and I was DYING. 

Normally, I will run longer runs in the 9:00-10:00 min/mile range.

Thoughts?,"I personally would be pretty bummed about it even if I wanted to be married to the person.

731,1623797231.0,We Need to Talk About the 80/20 Rule,"The rule originally comes from famed exercise physiologist Stephen Seiler. When he studied elite athletes, he found that 80% of their *sessions* were done at low intensity. 20% of their *sessions* were high intensity. High intensity is anything above the first ventilatory threshold, or the top of Zone 1 in a 3-zone model. Note that the athletes he studied were typically doing more than 10 sessions per week, which maps out to 2-3 high-intensity sessions per week. This is consistent with what other research has found to be optimal.

Many people here and elsewhere incorrectly believe that the ratio applies to either time or distance in zone. Instead, it refers to the ratio of hard sessions to easy ones. Any session that includes efforts in zones 2 or 3 (again, in a 3-zone model), is classified as a “hard” session.

It is also important to note that this “rule” began as an *observation.* Seiler observed **elite** athletes behaving a certain way and wrote it down. The “rule” was not intended to be a prescription. If you run 3 days/wk including 1 hard session, you’re at 67/33. That might work for you. Many people run 5-6 days/wk with 2 hard sessions. That might be 40% hard, but it works well for many people (myself included). There are many differences between us and elite athletes. Don’t mindlessly do what they do without understanding *why.*

So what does this mean for us? At its simplest level, it means mostly run slow, occasionally run hard. Don’t get bogged down in the exact distribution. DEFINITELY don’t spend any time (not one single second) trying to get your time-in-zone to work out to exactly 80/20. That misses the point entirely.

It is entirely possible to be in a speed block (focusing on 200m and 400m repeats, for example) and only spend 5% of your time or distance above zone 1. This would be normal and productive.

733,1625606456.0,"How I transformed from injury-prone, painful lower legs to nearly bulletproof lower legs","When I started running again in December, I couldn't get far (0-2 miles) without a lot of lower leg pain. Over the months I've added more and more to my fitness routine until today I can run pretty much as far as I want (8-10 miles before being stopped by fatigue) and will be stopped by fatigue, not by pain ever. So I will share with you my fitness routine, maybe it can help a couple of these posters I've seen discussing pain in their calves, shins, or knees.

Running routine: Start with a **dynamic warmup** targeting lower legs.

3 STEPS FOR DYNAMIC WARMUP:

 * Do this one, to the letter. Amazing dynamic warmup. If I did no other warmup I'd do this one at least. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zs4hh4cp98

 * Then do this tippy toes exercise: stand on your tippy toes. Stay on your tippy toes until the end of this entire exercise. Lift one foot off the ground, remaining on tippy toes on the planted foot, then flex the ankle of the foot that is lifted off the ground, pulling your toes as straight up in the air as possible, and hold for about 1-2 sec and then step forward about 6 inches ahead GENTLY landing on your tippy toes with the airborne foot, maintaining balance you are now on tippy toes with both feet in a ""stride"" position about 6 inches apart, now complete the stride by lifting your back foot that has been planted the whole time and bringing it to alignment with your front foot, keeping it up in the air, point the toes upwards like you did with the first foot, keep walking like this for about 20-30 feet, staying on tippy toes the whole time and always flexing your toes upwards in the foot that goes airborne. Tempo is unimportant here, what is important is practice your balance, don't work through pain, and try to push for ankle strength and flexibility by doing this exercise and walking about 20-30 feet before every single run this way, you will improve over time and don't feel bad if you feel awkward or lose your balance, because this exercise will improve your balance and ankle strength and mobility over time but you won't start out with good balance.

 * For the final step in your dynamic warmup, do the lightest possible jogging you possibly can not even getting CLOSE to winding yourself or getting out of breath, just the slowest pace you possibly can for about 5 minutes before you start your actual jog.

THE JOG

Now go for a jog. If you experience pain at any point, your jog is over. Walk the rest, you will still get aerobic exercise by walking. Don't be prideful here, keep in mind your goal is PAIN FREE ability. Pain is your body telling you that something is wrong, so LISTEN to it. Shorten your routes especially early on, and run on soft surfaces like trails if possible. Early on when I was getting lower leg pain, my jogs were really short like maybe a mile, and I would still eventually start hurting in my shins and calves and have to stop jogging, and I would gently gently walk my way home. If the pain was intensely bad or splitting or stinging, I wouldn't have even walked the end of the jog, instead I would've sat on the curb and called someone to come and pick me up.

AFTER A SUCCESSFUL JOG

Note this is only in my routine after a SUCCESSFUL jog, meaning one where I was NOT stopped by pain. At this stage I'm sometimes totally drenched in sweat and exhausted, but my legs can still handle this warm down routine because of the insane blood flow they are getting after a run. I do the following short routine to take advantage of the increased blood flow to my legs to improve my flexibility and strength THROUGH A FULL range of motion:

 * 1 set of 10 ATG split squats on each leg

 * 1 set of 25 tibialis raises leaning against a wall

Do these sets for a total of 3 times each, with 30 second to a minute breaks in between because I'm usually out of breath still and recovering from my run. The ATG split squats are FANTASTIC for your knees, hips, quads, glutes and range of motion for all of those, stretching your hip flexors while building strength through a complete range of motion for them and even hitting your glutes and lower legs. The only thing about this exercise is that ATG split squats ARE DANGEROUS if you haven't worked up to them and aren't used to doing them. So for starting out the ATG split squats, have a chair next to you that you can set a hand on to support your weight while you're learning the exercise (see the below video on atg split squat, he demonstrates them on incline and assisted with a chair at his side).

How to do the ATG split squat is the first 40 seconds of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwzEiDfemQg

How to do tibialis raises: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNS_QjGAs_k

REST DAYS CORE

The final component of my routine is that on rest days I will often do core workouts. Particularly targetting glutes, obliques and hips. Eliud Kipchoge is the world record holding marathoner, so I do his core workout:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eFweoFgFf4

Main thing with EVERY STEP of this is not to work through pain. Using this routine I've gone from off the couch running usually less than a mile and limping home in December 2020, to running up to 10 miles with incline both uphill and downhill trail running at a pace of 8:30/mile to 9:30/mile on my long run days. I'm no elite runner but I went from nearly injured, sedentary, poor mobility and painful ability, to never experiencing knee pain or shin pain or calf pain on these intense uphill runs. This routine laid a solid foundation that I continue to benefit from to this day.

I hope this post can help anyone who is frustrated with pain or lack of ability barring them from entering the amazing sport we all love that is running. Also I'm an open book, feel free to post questions here if you need any clarification about any aspect of this. I'm about to go run the trails right now, but I will be back and will read and respond to any replies that people post on this.

**EDIT:  This post absolutely blew up so I'm going to add on some stuff here at the end to try to make it more responsible advice. I'm not editing the above section of the post any further so please treat this edit as a warning related to my post.**

 * **First** of all WARNING: This post is an N of 1 post. What that means is that statistically, if something works for one person it doesn't mean that it will work for many. If you published a statistical study with a sample size of 1 person you'd be the laughingstock of the science world.

 * **Second** of all, it has been pointed out to me by some kind Redditors even an actual CPT responding to this post that this routine may have worked for me in particular, and that doesn't mean it will work for everyone and could even be harmful for some people with different issues than what I had. I had weak, shortened hip flexors and weak, lengthened glutes and I strengthened both of those, and lengthened my hip flexors using this routine. I also had some unique knee issues and stuff going on that MIGHT NOT BE THE SAME issues that you have. So please, employ caution when using my routine as a whole. It might not work for you in fact it could do more harm than good if you are ""correcting"" in a way that your body doesn't need. 

For that reason I am going to quote u/calcobrena 's advice for DIYers here:

>My biggest advice to DIYers is,
>
>1. Make sure you can perform the exercise without pain. Only lower yourself to the point of compensation and work your way down as you get stronger.
>
>2. Make absolutely sure you are doing it correctly. Consult multiple sources and view the exercise from different angles.
>3. Consider trying to get movement assessments. Sometimes gyms will have free trials that include assessments. When you know what compensations you have, you can more accurately search the Internet for the fixes. This will cut out a lot of that trial and error because the ""error"" part COULD result in an injury.
>
>4. Question everything some stranger tells you and ask for their credentials. For example, my NASM CPT # is 1210640940. If they won't share their credentials, they probably have no education *OR* insurance. For example, I'm also insured (NEXT Policy# NXT5E5LKUH-00-GL), so if someone hurt themselves because of an exercise I told them to do, then my insurance will cover their medical expenses. If a person isn't insured and you hurt yourself, you're basically screwed even if they are liable because it could ultimately cost you more money to sue them than you'd ever get from them unless you know for a fact they have assets you could lien on.

 * **Third** point of warning: this post describes how I moved myself from 0-2 miles at best on a run to 8-10 miles at best on my LONG runs. That means this advice helped me gain access to running as a BEGINNER. This advice may not be helpful for runners who are very experienced and already log tons of weekly miles.

 * **Fourth** and finally, I figured this routine out for myself during a period of my life when I didn't have health insurance. I could have injured myself doing this. I am fortunate that it worked for me, but I would have GREATLY PREFERRED to simply work with a physical therapist to correct my body issues scientifically rather than through my own trial and error. That is the route that I would recommend everyone to go. A physical therapist can help you fix your body much better than just diving into my exercise routine will, especially if you have different issues than I do.",running

735,1578253996.0,Completed my first Full Marathon today.,"
Race: Jacksonville Marathon (Jan 5, 2020)

GOAL TIME: Finish (and try for <5 hours)

FINISH TIME: 4:59:59 

Background Info:

I’m a college freshman, I’ve been running since Junior year of HS. I’m not a cross country / track person. My HS district actually had a “half marathon club” and that’s where I first started running. We would train for four months using the Galloway (run walk run) method and the whole goal was a “couch to 13.1” 

My Junior year I did the half in about 2:13, and senior year I finished in 1:57. But I didn’t run when the program was over, just waited back up until the next year. 

Fast-forward to the start of College. I very much wanted to avoid the “freshman 15” and wanted to accomplish something that I always wanted to — run a full Marathon. I talked to a buddy of mine who had never ran before, and he wanted to do it with me. I’m sure it probably wasn’t smart for him to do that, but he’s a fit guy. 

We did the Hal Higdon 18 week Novice 1 plan. However, I think our mistake was we cut one of the days out because we just had so much going on it was tough to allocate the extra 1.5hrs somedays. So we stuck with two shorter runs (eventually basically 6+ miles and then a 10) and then whatever the long run was. 

I swear by Galloway since that was what I was used to, 2 minute run : 30 second walk. Was pacing really good throughout the training at 11:00/mi. 

Training went smoothly, ran two half marathons during the training so we could get some medals/tshirts under our belts, and kept chugging along.

Fast forward until about 3 weeks ago when we did the 20mile run. My foot started to bother me and it would really ache after runs. I think it’s just plantar fasciitis. I took it easy on the last two weeks to make sure I was good for the Marathon. I really didn’t want to give up.

Race Day:

My foot had felt fine the days leading into today. But once I started running it hurt. I minced through the pain and eventually it faded and reappeared every 5-6 miles and lasted about a mile. It sucked. It made it so frustrating because I had worked this hard and didn’t want to have to quit. 

I suffered through it. Miles 23+ were absolute hell. My foot was nonstop throbbing and I lost a toenail which added to the pain. I wasn’t quitting. I made it through and checked my runkeeper and we skipped our last two walk breaks because I wanted to make sure we finished <5. Managed to finish at 4:59:59, so I call that a win.

Post Race:
I’ve cooled down. I had some chafing and dealing w the toenail loss. My foot feels better now after letting it rest and stretching a bit. I plan to take a week or so off and just let it heal. I don’t think it’s a stress fracture but it might be (I think it’s just overuse).

Future:

Overall it was a great experience. It felt so amazing finishing this race. Doing the Galloway and taking it at a more moderate pace means I don’t get physically tired or winded. The only thing that made this race not fun was my foot, everything else was great.

I’m not sure what’s next. I think Half Marathons are much more enjoyable. In the future I’m not sure if I’ll try to increase speed at all or just stay at the more relaxed pace and see if I want to do more. But for now, I’m just going to celebrate. 

Absolutely anything is possible if you put your mind to it. I’m so happy I finished, it was truly an amazing feat.",running

738,1611365780.0,Small Changes Which Have Drastically Improved Your Running?,"Yesterday I went out for a casual 6 mile. Midway through the first mile I realized that I’m not lifting my legs much (something which my high school track coach yelled at us to do all the time), and start lifting up my knees more as a result. I ended up running 6:10 pace on the 6 mile, a solid 20-35 seconds faster than I’ll usually take those kind of runs, and yet, my legs and body somehow felt less tired afterwards. Similarly, I tried picking up my knees more on my easy 4 miles again today. Once again, my pace drops a considerable 15-20 seconds without any extra considerable effort.
Now obviously, I can’t automatically attribute simply picking up my knees as the sole cause of having good runs the past 2 days. There could’ve been tons of factors. If anything I’ll need to keep working on my form for a few weeks to see if it makes any difference. However, it got me thinking.

""Yeah, that time really isn't that great"".
I know that. I am well aware it's not that great. But the built up I had to get to that time is something else.

Goodbye 2020, goodbye hamstrings!","I mostly lurk this subreddit for inspiration when I’m feeling very burnt out on my running routine, for tips on how to add mileage, etc. Even from the sidelines it’s a very motivating community, and that’s why I was browsing the sub this morning before my run— I had a tough night last night comparing myself and my running accomplishments to others and feeling really inadequate. I was just feeling down about myself in general, and was dreading going into today’s planned long run that way. So I looked at the sub for motivation, had some coffee beforehand (per this sub’s suggestion - I usually go totally fasted, no drinks or anything) and set out. 

I run mostly to keep my sanity and the fact that it has my body in very able shape is a bonus, so I don’t really set goals for my runs often- it’s more just a “get out and do it” thing. I’ve been slowly upping my mileage over the last few weeks and knock out 7-8 milers consistently. I’ve only done 10 miles once, this summer, and felt like I was in a position to do 10 miles even better now so that’s what I was planning on. There was an inkling in the back of my mind about what if I tried for the half, but I figured I’d see how the 10 went and go from there. I think honestly around mile 4 I knew I was going to end up doing it, and at mile 7 the “I would love to be able to say I ran a half” feeling kicked in and I was set on it. 

By mile 10 when I had beat my previous best time by 15 minutes, I felt great. I smiled because I was proud which is not something I usually do while running honestly. The last 3 miles were naturally more of a struggle (especially the last half of mile 13, my god, stopping at stoplights had me afraid my legs wouldn’t start moving again) but I did it AND I never went over 8 min/mile pace! I finished with my average pace at 7:37, which is what I hold for my 10k’s regularly, and I was shocked. 1:40 time total, and I had no goals besides just to do the thing, so I’m thrilled. 

I wanted to say thank you to the community for picking me back up when I forget why I run, and giving me inspiration to get out there another day and do the damn thing all over again. And inspiring me to try harder while making sure it’s still fun. I haven’t felt this good about myself in awhile, and it’s a great way to close out 2020.

748,1640033116.0,Are all group runs socially awkward?,"So. 

I’ve been a runner for a long time and am somewhat known around my office as the ‘runner guy’. Therefore it is not uncommon for the topic of running or training to come up. Sometimes people will say they are lacking in motivation, bored with their routes, or feel unsafe. In these cases I often suggest group runs, especially those at running stores. One gal was especially adamant that she will never go to a group run again unless she knows people. Apparently no one talks to her, she ends up running by herself, so if that’s the case… why go anyway. 

So I said she was crazy. So I was in the same neighborhood as a group run I had suggested to her and decided to try it out while my daughter was in dance class. I showed up and must admit it was quite clicky. The fast people stood together, the moms with strollers stood together, the ultra people were together, etc etc. So in the gal’s defense, it does not “appear” group runs… especially larger ones necessarily cater to newbies or those new to the pre-established group. Everyone that knows someone mingles. Those that don’t….. stretch or look at their phones in the periphery.

So, large pre-established runs also seem to have pre-determined routes that new people have no clue. They may see notice on IG or FB of the distance… but I will say for a new, unfamiliar runner, a group leader saying “we are running the McKay Bridge route tonight” isn’t super helpful. 

So we take off. I’m not the fastest, but not the slowest. Apparently I’m in the I’m able to  still SEE the fastest runners ahead, but significantly ahead of marathon people and stroller moms group. So…. I work to catch some of the fast group drops. So it’s a 5 mile route, I actually catch one guy who basically alludes to the fact he wasn’t going to run “Eric’s” pace for all nine miles. WTF I state I thought it was a 5 mile route, and he said I should have turned back at the stoplight. Blimey. 

So I turn back, get to the light, turn and immediately find the people that were running behind me. So I run through the walkers, stroller moms, and end up catching a group of guys chatting about a recent marathon. I kind of just sit in, not knowing where the hell I was going, and said I had made a wrong turn. Then one guy made some kind of a crack about the ‘fast group turnaround’ which I took as him saying I couldn’t hang with the fast guys so now I am licking my wounds and running with the slow guys. It was weird, and awkward. I felt a little creeper for just running along and listening to them. They didn’t talk to me. One of them finally said, “don’t let us hold you up.” So I took the opportunity to end the awkwardness and said thanks and pressed on. I didn’t sprint off, I merely increased my pace maybe 5 to 10 seconds a mile.

All would’ve been fine, except… One of the older guys came with me. To be honest I was kind of happy someone did, because I had zero clue where the hell it was I was going… But it soon became clear this had turned into some kind of race (For him at least). I just went along at my 5 mile pace, and every once in a while in between breaths he would say something like… Come on, you are doing great… Or I think we can catch them. I didn’t have any clue what or who he was talking about, but found I had some kind of out of breath comrade versus some unknown adversaries. So there we were. I just kept running until lo and behold it happened again. I ran straight through an intersection, and suddenly he was screaming at me, apparently I missed another turn. Sigh. 

He waited up and Said “I’m sorry I thought you knew the route”. He was a decent guide The rest of the way, but then for some reason treated me from that point forward like some kind of complete running newbie. Like… new to running altogether, Which was really really weird (I’m almost 50). I mean, I didn’t want to toot my own horn, but I didn’t really want to get lectured over intervals and shin splints for the rest of the way either. So I just kept asking HIM questions and we eventually got to the end… Where he then proceeded to brag about me being pretty fast for a “new guy”. The other guys we had run with were kinda grumbly in a ‘he thinks he’s better than us’ vibe. Weird.

So the run had some organized stretching afterwards and some snacks during which fast guys who ran 9 miles came in to some awe and fanfare, to which I kid you not one of them said to me, sorry to drop you, we didn’t know you wanted to do the long route. I said I didn’t, I just didn’t know where to go and so I was following them which he TOTALLY smirked like I just couldn’t hang and turned around. Which I suppose was partially true. Anyway. 

In this case the gal at work was right. I could definitely see how less experienced less confident people could struggle at well established group runs If no one reaches out and notices/welcomes them.

I say all of this to simply challenge everyone to look around for new people at group runs or suggest the run leader to identify new people and welcome them, or at least match them up or introduce them comparable runner(s). Please remind people of the route details, or place cones at the notable turns. That way it won’t reflect negatively on the group run and be a good experience for the new runner.",running

Anyway, as a background, I had a quintuple bypass in Dec 2019. I started Cardiac Rehab in Feb 2020 but the program shutdown the following month because of COVID19. Was given a piece of paper with exercises to do at home, which I found uninspiring. I asked if I could train for a 5K run in 3 months instead. They just gave me a heart rate ceiling for the training. Completed first non-stop 5K in May 2020. Decided to keep going. Completed 10K in July 2020. By September 2020, I completed my first Half Marathon. Did another one in May 2021. Last October, my cardiologist declared my heart to be normal. No more heart rate ceilings. As soon as registration opened, I signed up for my first full marathon at the Vancouver Marathon on May 2022.

I've selected an 18 week training program that seems to suit my current pace and - more importantly - my daily life and work.

753,1553974965.0,Dropped out of a marathon today.,"So, today I had a goal of running a sub 3 marathon at the Carmel Marathon. Things were going pretty good, for about 16 miles. The other day my left Achilles started to bother me, but I didn't think much of it. I iced and stretched it and whatever else I could think to help it heal before the race. I woke up this morning and it was feeling mostly fine, but not 100% like it should. I did a short warm up jog, felt fine. I was actually on 2:58 pace at the half way point, still felt fine. I found a way to land on my left foot that didn't bother me, and that I could do while comfortably maintaining pace. Around mile 16 I started noticing that my form was breaking down and that my Achilles was starting to hurt, so I attempted to land differently so I could still comfortably run at pace. By mile 17.6 I ended up pulling the plug and told a medical guy that I needed to be driven back to the start/finish because I couldn't finish the race. He let me sit in his car to warm up and stay dry while he called for help (he was directing traffic so couldn't leave), and I broke down into tears in his car for what felt like an eternity. For the first time in my life I dropped from a race. I did this because I wanted to avoid further hurting my Achilles and that developing into a serious injury. I was humbled today from this, because not all the time will I be able to just get up and run super far. Sometimes things go to shit and you can't do much about it. I wanted to share this with you guys because I figured there's at least one other person in this subreddit who is going through some sort of injury while attempting to push it like me, and if you are one of those people I want to tell you that it's okay to take a break. It's okay to take a short period off of running so you can fully recover from an injury. As much as I don't want to, I'm planning on not running a single mile this upcoming week so I can focus on recovery. Dropping from the marathon was extremely difficult for me to do, but if I pushed through I could have ended my 2019 racing much earlier and could have done some real damage. I imagine a lot of us want to run until we're old, but if we're all trying to push ourselves and not allowing ourselves to be smart with avoiding injury, it could really come back to bite us in the ass. Hopefully I was able to reach out to someone with this",running

Anyway, as he was enjoying a well-deserved post-run sit down, some utter sod pinched his finishers bag, including his t-shirt. 

He mentions quite frequently how annoyed he was with himself for not keeping an eye on things, and how he wishes he had the T-shirt. And I’d love to be able to give him a replacement shirt for Christmas. 

I’ve been keeping an eye open on eBay for months, but to no avail. So I figured I’d come and ask the running community here on Reddit. 

So, does anyone have a finishers shirt from the 2013 Paris marathon that they’d be willing to sell me? It would mean the world to me, and my dad.

755,1591540651.0,Training review - How I shaved 5 minutes off my 5K time in 8 weeks,"tldr: I used the beginner 5K plan from [Free Running Plans](http://freerunningplans.com) and went from a 33:30 5K to 28:34 in 8 weeks. Would recommend.

**First, some context**: I've been running consistently for the last three years, approximately 2-3 times a week; easy runs. For those three years I followed a run/walk format, gradually increasing the interval from 3:1 to 10:1. I never did any speed work, repeats, tempo runs or anything like that. I did run a variety of distances though and completed two half-marathons. Despite this, I never ran steady for more than 5km. My best HM time was around 2:30:00; not great but I always enjoyed myself doing them and, after all, isn't that the point of running?

That said, I always felt that if I really wanted to consider myself a ""real"" runner, I had to do two things:

1. Stop using a walk/run format
2. Get my 5K time down under 30 minutes.

I know it's silly to say I didn't feel like a ""real"" runner; if you run, you're a real runner. Full stop. I guess I just expected more from myself; after 3 years of running, I was still very much a beginner.

Over the years I did learn about running training models. I knew all about fartleks, repeats, hill sprints, etc. I even saved a few plans and programmed them into my garmin to try out, but I couldn't follow along; my cardio fitness was too low and I always found myself gasping for breath, unable to complete the workouts. They just weren't tailored enough to my current fitness level.

At the start of the COVID-19 quarantines, I decided that I needed a goal to work towards and, as luck would have it, I found a thread by /u/Free_Running_Plans offering to write people a customized running plan for the next 8-10 weeks. This was exactly what I needed!

**The Plan**: I took a glance at the various plans on the site and ultimately decided on a beginner 5km plan. After inputting my current 5km time (and converting the spreadsheet to kms instead of miles) I was left with a schedule consisting of 5 runs per week, with 2 workout runs that would be either repeats or tempos, and 3 easy runs, including some hill sprints, strideouts and longer distances. Overall, very digestible and easy to remember. Nothing to program into my garmin, just get out there and do the workout in the time allotted. After 3 weeks you would do a time trial for 1.6km which would set your time goals for the next few weeks, then another time 3.2km time trial 6 weeks in to set your final targets.

You don't even need a running watch; any old watch is fine, as long as you're familiar with/plan your distances ahead of time.

I felt very confident that I could achieve those times because, not only were they based on **my** current fitness level, many of them seemed a bit easy... at least initially. I set myself a goal of bringing my 5km time down to 32 minutes as an ""easy"" goal, 30 minutes as a ""moderate goal"" and 28 minutes as a ""hard/best case"" never really expecting to achieve it.

The first few weeks sort of ease you into it, but the middle of the plan was the most challenging. Times got faster, repeats got longer and I had to dig deep, as they say, to complete some of the workouts. That being said, I only failed to complete one workout during the entire 8 weeks, and I chalked that one up to bad weather negatively impacting my morale. I'm very confident that all the workouts were totally achievable for me.

**My baseline time was 5km @ 33:30** - This was an average. Sometimes I could get 32:45, some days it was closer to 34. Sometimes I ran it steady, but most of the time I'd walk some.

**My first time trial was 1.6km (1 mile) @ 8:30** - this was my fastest mile ever and, I'm pretty sure, the fastest I could conceivably run. I was completely exhausted after this run.

**My second time was 3.2km (2 mile) @ 18:11** - I felt good initially but realized I went too hard and lost steam at the end. Still, 9:10/mile was not too shabby.

**My final 5km time was 28:34** - my fastest 5km time ever, and almost a full 5 minutes faster than my baseline. Achieved on a mostly flat walking trail, with light wind. I actually ran a 28:54 a few days before my final run in the plan, so I am proud to say that it wasn't a one-time event!

I learned several very important things from this plan:

1. **Throttle control** - Everyone always says that beginners need to slow down, but that does that mean, exactly? What's too fast? What's too slow? By following the target paces in this plan, I got a great understanding of what my slow, medium and fast paces feel like.
2. **Training variety** - You shouldn't be doing all your runs at your top pace. You need to have more slow days than fast days and your fast days need to work on drills that will actually help you get faster/stronger, not just blowing yourself out.
2. **Staying focused** - We all know running is so mental, but having these goals really helped me focus my energy on a specific tasks, rather than how much I wanted to quit. ""Just two more reps!"" or ""Just 5 more minutes!""  are much more helpful affirmations when you have a clear target; a light at the end of the tunnel. What's more, because the plan is based on **my** performance, there's no reason I shouldn't be able to complete this.
3. **Challenging yourself is good** - Before some of the workout days, I actually felt nervous. I didn't know if I'd be able to complete it, it seemed very hard, and I was afraid of failing. It turns out that the goals this plan put in front of me was just enough of a stretch that it was challenging, but not enough that it was setting me up to fail. Every time I was able to complete the workout (which, as I say above was every time but once) I felt amazing; like I'd actually achieved something.
4. **You're better than you think** - It's not like this training plan magically imbued me with running ability (I mean, probably, right?); all that improvement happened because I had the right tools and appropriate focus.

**Bottom line** - If you want to work on improving your times, you should give these a try, especially if you are unfamiliar with training techniques and want something easy to follow along with or if, like me, you're in a rut with your running and need a good focus. Thanks to these plans, I was able to overachieve on my goal and feel more confident in myself as a runner than ever. I can't recommend them enough!

763,1586597572.0,From having open-heart surgery in December 2019 to running my first ever 3.8km,"The title says it all. I have had congenital heart disease for my entire life, and was at my somewhat fittest state at 12 years of age (right before having surgery #2 out of 6). But, I could only run 3km for cross-country (barely), and couldn't survive Under 12's Aussie Rules Football each week.

Fast forward to 2019; after waiting for 6 months to have my surgery, it happened. And, before my Cardiac Rehab, I set myself a goal of being able to run, something I have never been able to do before. 

Since quarantine began here in Australia, I have been running basically every day, either on the road or on the treadmill. I began only being able to run between 1 and 2km. 

Last week I ran a 3.5km on the road, stopping once about 500m away from home to throw up (not pleasant, I know, I'm not the fittest), but I pushed through until I got home (that run took approximately 20 minutes). 

Then, late last night, I jumped on the treadmill for a run before dinner. Before I knew it, I had run at an incline of 1 for 24:08, at a speed of 8 for the majority of my run (jogging pace), but alternating between 10 and 12 for particular songs about halfway through. 
I checked my pedometer on my phone and realised that I had just run approximately 3.8km, my farthest without stopping ever. 

I do have goals to run a 5k, 10k, and half-marathon, and I can see some glimmer of hope that I'm headed in the right direction after a mere month of training (since my Rehab finished).",running
764,1637171498.0,Wondering if I should register as male or female in a race?,"I’ve recently gotten back into running after a long hiatus, and as part of that I’d like to sign up for a 5k. However, this would be the first race I’ve run since I transitioned, and I’m worried about what gender to put down.

I’m in my mid twenties, transgender, and I transitioned from male to female a few years ago. In that time I’ve fully socially transitioned, as well as legally changed my name and gender. I’ve also been on hormone replacement therapy for 3 years, and am post op, so I’ve had gender confirmation surgery. My testosterone was low before from being on hormones, and I’m assuming it’s basically non existent now that I’ve surgery. 

All that being said, I’m still nervous about signing up for a race as female. I know transgender people in sports is a controversial topic. And I’m not a competitive runner, I never have been. At best I’m running a 9 minute mile. So when I sign up for a race, it’s not because I’m trying to win, I started running again to help get back into shape, and because it’s good for my mental health. The only person I’m competitive against is myself. 

I think what I’m getting at is, while I’d very much prefer to be registered in the women’s category for obvious reasons, what I really want to do is avoid drama and just run my race. And if that means I register as male, as long as I don’t have to wear a big M on my chest, it’s not the end of the world to me. 

So, to my question, how do you think I should register for the race? Would you mind if a trans woman ran a race in the women’s category? Other women of running Reddit, do you think this would be unfair? And I’m after honest opinions, that’s why I made this post, I won’t mind. Thanks!

My hope is that this post does not come off as pretentious, but rather as a genuine outpouring in an attempt to positively influence some aspiring runners out there.  

A word about me: I have posted some training over the past year so I know some of you know, but I ran in college and run professionally.  I only say that because I know, and have seen, what it takes to get to the top (well, close to it, I am not winning Olympic medals!)

I know a lot of you here are beginners who run for enjoyment or weight loss.  My main points that follow, while possibly applicable to you, are not intended for you.  Keep running and keep having fun.  Experiment and enjoy yourself.  Weight lift if you want.  Eat crappy food.  Play other sports.  In short, do your thing.  

However, I know a lot of people want to know how to get to that next level, whether that be breaking 14 for 5k, 16, 18, 20, 25, or whatever your individual talent will allow for.  I hope you will all take the time to listen to what I have to say.  I do not claim to know everything as I am not even 25 years old, but I have trained for a long time and did study both sports medicine and exercise science in college.  I feel qualified to give an opinion.

Without further ado..

**1)** Nothing, and I mean nothing, can replicate running.  Pool running is not running.  Biking is not running.  The number one thing you can do to get faster is to run more, faster, and more consistently.  Can't run much due to time constraints?  Can't stay healthy without cross training?  Find more time to run. Learn to stay healthy so you can run more.  Cross training can be fun and sometimes offers a respite from hard training-- that's ok.  Just don't get suckered into believing it is ""just as good"" or a viable replacement.  If you have enough energy to supplement training with other forms of exercise, you probably aren't training hard enough.  

Note:  Yes, I can see some of you thinking ""but Salazar's guys do a lot of supplemental training!"".  Yes, they do.  They also have literally nothing to do but train all day and simply cannot run more. Thus, they do other things.  They are also trying to run 12:50 with a 53 second last lap... which will be further addressed in the strength training segment.

**2)**  Stretching is not a requirement to be a successful runner.  Whoa, whoa, hold your horses before you shoot me for treason and hear me out.  Stretching has not been linked to improved performance or enhanced injury prevention.  The fact is, it's probably a waste of time.  Sure, some people seem to do ok with it.  If you have experimented and KNOW, without a doubt, that stretching is what keeps you healthy, then go for it.  Otherwise, try dropping it.  In most cases it simply creates microtears in the muscles in addition to causing them to lose power if done before exercise.  Most runners have plenty of mobility to run without doing it.  Guess what's the best way to gain mobility if you lack it?  You guessed it -- run more.  

**3)**  Core and strength work.  Ah, core work.  The buzz word that gets thrown around way, way too often.  I feel very similarly about core as I do about stretching.  The best ""core work"" you can do as a runner is to run.  Let me say that again.  *The best core work you can do as a runner is to run*.  Core exercises won't give you a six pack (hint, running probably will).  If you are truly unstable and weak, then perhaps you will have to do some supplemental work.  I am not naive enough to think that this case does not exist.  However, I can assure  you that most runners are simply wasting their time doing pointless exercises that are more likely to INJURE them than to increase strength and stability.  

Note:  Yep, Salazar again.  If you are trying to run 53 second quarters to close 5 and 10ks, you need to lift.  Most runners aren't fit enough to even have a chance to use that kind of speed at the end of races, thus making focusing on it a waste of time.  Get strong (aerobically, that is).  Once you are in contention in diamond league races you can worry about being explosive.  Until then, run more.

**4)**  Quit worrying about your foot strike.  If you run more, you will learn to run well. I have never once in my life worried about my foot strike.  In fact, I have never seen a single teammate or fellow high level competitor do this.  Go to a local running store and get fit for a pair of shoes that fit your arch type.  That's all you get to think about your feet.  Now get out the door and run!

**5)**  You are probably over weight.  (note, girls, be careful with this one...).  If you are carrying excess weight, you will run slower.  Clean up your diet and get skinny.  DO NOT starve yourself.  Eat good food, train hard, and your body will find its sweet spot.  Don't, however, kid yourself into thinking you can carry around 10 extra pounds and still perform at your best.   

**6)** You don't have to run hill repeats to be fast.  Find some hilly routes and run them on occasion.  Do workouts on hilly courses.  You don't, however, need to devote full days to running hills.  I am not saying you can't... but I think your time would be much better spent doing a real workout session that involves hills.  Go find a hilly 12 mile loop and do a hard tempo on it.  Boom, hills and tempo in one day.  You are welcome.  

**7)**  Running is hard.  Working out hurts.  Racing hurts even more.  There are no shortcuts.  Run more, run longer, run harder.  Listen to your body.  Don't skip steps, but realize you have to take risks to get better sometimes.  Don't be afraid to put your body on the line and really get after it.

771,1614626877.0,PSA: Get a blood test!,"I posted a couple weeks ago complaining that my sports bra was causing back and rib pain. Well, as it turns out - it was a totally different issue and I'm shocked that I got the diagnosis that I did!


I had been running steadily for two years with no issues when all of a sudden my performance dropped like a rock at the beginning of the year. I thought I was overtraining, or too tired from work, or just getting burned out. I am used to jogging 40-50 mpw and while I wasn't the fastest to begin with, I knew something was wrong when I struggled to finish my daily 7 mile runs at 15:00 min/mile. I'd take time off or take it easy but it wouldn't help. Then I started getting pain in my ribs, shoulders and back (which I thought was due to an ill-fitting bra). Running was just physically harder to do.


It was leading to a really negative cycle, mentally. I would berate myself for not trying harder, for not being faster or having the stamina anymore. I started tracking my times and they just got worse and worse. It was really tough for me. 


The final straw was when I nearly fainted in the shower and I scheduled a general checkup with my primary care physician. My CBC was shocking - HGB of 6, numbers all over the place, and my iron levels were undetectable. I was called in to the emergency room for a blood transfusion. That was last week.


What a difference this week has been! I've been taking it easy, but my times this week have easily been cut by a third. I no longer feel like I am running through knee-deep water. There were a lot of other symptoms of severe anemia that I managed to explain away (depression? It's covid isolation. Feeling cold all the time? It's winter, dummy. Lightheadedness? I just haven't eaten lunch yet. Etc. etc.). And even my doctor was shocked at how low my numbers were, considering I was still trying to force myself to run - I even did a small hike after I had my checkup.

I’m talking about non-runners who think of marathons as the defining characteristic of a runner. I run multiple 10K runs a week and don’t have a desire to run a marathon; that distance does not appeal to me (power to those it does!). But the marathon is an extremely challenging distance that I don’t understand as a general societal expectation for your more casual runner.

Today I ran 22km at my comfortable pace (5min/km) and am very happy that I maintained good form the whole time and don't feel very exhausted at all.

780,1640004309.0,Cardiac Arrest when walk/jog 5 miles. Walking uphills and jogging on flat surface. (took it easy).,"Hello everyone,  just wanted to bring some type of awareness to community. I'm in mid 30s, male, weight 185 about 5'7.5ish that .5 is important :).  Ran several marathons, few 50ks, glorious high elevation hikes and many trail marathons.  That was all a couple years ago.  The past two months i've been trying to get sodium up to balanced levels so i haven't trained much.  This past Thursday 12/16/2021 i went out for a run/walk in Balboa Park (trails) of San Diego during lunch break.  Strava said i made it to 5 miles about 1000ft gain of walk/jog.  While running through the museum portion on El Prado just passed Pan American Rd. about to make to cross over the 163.  I fell unconscious into cardiac arrest.  Now apparently a couple (trail angels) found me performed chest compressions until ambulance showed up to use the defibrillator on me, i cameback thankfully.  I got  an ICD/AED installed on Friday just under my skin over the heart muscles and wires in ventricle heart, incase that happens again.    Here are symptoms i've experienced before and especially on Thursday.  Racing heartrate, seconds of burning chest almost like acid reflux, you know that light headed feeling catching your breath where it feels like your vision pixels are going darker and they suddenly comeback.  Well its sort of like that except on a higher scale.   I experienced racing heartrate (which is normal for getting good workout).  Near the bridge is where i collapsed i started walking to take deep breathes and lower heartrate. The vision went darker and darker, i started stumbling cause i was dizzy and knew I wasn't coming back.  I think i started talking out loud that i was gonna black out, seeking help.  My hearing was last sense to go.  I'm unsure if someone caught me last second to lessen the damage to my fall, cause face isn't that bad (knees mostly damaged).  Then that was it for me being anything until the shock of the AED.  If you have history like me of thinking that the burning chest, light headed, dizzyness, and maybe even stumbling is normal during workout.  GO TO ER immediately.  Pay close attention to your health.  I got extremely lucky i fell in tourist location. Five minutes prior i was on trails on the trail or two minutes later i would've been back on trails alone.  I love running, the community, hiking and exploring.  For you runners just keep running on but please be aware of your health. I'm under meds so i apologize if i don't make much sense.
Edit:  Here is some more details from Garmin Watch.  https://imgur.com/a/xOsDdvL
UPDATE: 6/21/2022 since this post i've not yet gotten back to strenuous activities.  No blocks or leakage found effecting heart, MRI and all imaging shows healthy heart.  During some light workouts the ICD will pace me.  I've also had three proper shock events but each of those i lose consciousness so its not all bad.  The main goal is figuring out why i  go into Vtach.  Now doctors are checking if SIADH is the issue.  Feel free to PM me if you are getting ICD and need someone to talk to feel free to PM me.

### Training
I used Hal Higdon 26 week 50k training program which I cut a few weeks off to make fit with my schedule. Training went fairly well thanks to Covid leaving more time to devote to running.

 I had three weeks left in the plan. Saturday was an easy 1.5 hour run with no issues, Sunday was a 4 hour run. I noticed a small twinge in my lower leg at mile 8 but not painful. At mile 11 it got worse and by 11.5 I had called for a pickup two hours early. Shoutout to my amazing wife for showing up to play ambulance on the side of the road in the dead of night.

 After two days of pain I scheduled a PT and took the rest of the week off. I was super down as I haven't dealt with an injury to date and didn't want to ""waste"" the time I had put in. He gave me some good advice and put a plan together that would test if I was fit to run. We also set guidelines to follow at the race to keep myself healthy for my long term goals.

### Pre-race
I was still waffling weather I was going to do the race four days out. I had told everyone I wasn't going to run but I had still packed my bags. 

I eventually told my wife I wanted to try, my runs went well and I started to realize I was in my head about the pain from that night. I figured if I dnf'ed I had already told most people I wasn't planning on starting so who cares. I set my new goal at making the 1st aid station at mile 8.8 which would be my longest run since my pain.

### Race
The start of the race went really well. A steep 4.4 mile section to Music pass followed by returning down to Music Meadows for the 1st aid station. Having your car parked 30feet from the aid and access to it mid race is SUPER coinvent. I sat down grabbed some more fuel, retied my shoes while my wife filled my bottles (again an angel for sitting in a field all day so I can run in the mountains). 

 I was under pace by a few minutes and feeling fantastic. I set out on the longest section feeling good about completing the whole race. 13.2 miles out and back along rainbow trail. I stopped at the really well stocked aid statin and decided to stick to water, my packed food and a handful of twizzles. I was still feeling good and on pace or better until mile 17. I was working my way down the trail when my stomach lurched and I had to get sick on the side of the trail. Huge thanks to the couple that stopped to check on me and offered food/drinks. I was able to get running again after a few minutes and I made it back to base camp at mile 22 still ahead of schedule by 20 minutes*(mid race pace calculation may be wrong). I honestly didn't feel that bad yet.

 I stepped out of camp on my way up music pass, only 8.8 miles and 2200' of elevation stood between me and my first 50k. Mile 23 went bad, fast. I couldn't keep food down so I hadn't been fueling properly and was running on water and watered down tailwind. Mile 24 was the worst mile I have ever ran in my life both in terms of speed and pain. I was stopping every tenth of a mile and making deals with myself about how far I could go. The next three miles where slightly easier but only as I had resigned myself to the pain. Hitting the top of Music Pass might as well of been the finish line. It's all I had fixated on for the last three and a half hours. The 4.4 miles down hill where better but not easy. I was able to keep moving with much more consistency and I even ran in the last .75 mile, a feat I couldn't have done an hour before. I ran in to my wife cheering and actual people at the finish line.

### Whats Next?
I really need to work on fueling and it will be the focus of my long runs but I'm going to take some time and work on a 5k plan and strength training. I think getting some speed work in will help my efficiency and I would like a small break from long running before I start in on 100 mile training next march.

*Edit* I appreciate the advice on the 100. I'm still planning on training for it but I understand I probably be ready. When sign up time coms I'm fully willing to drop down to 50m or 100k if I'm not ready yet. My long term goal is 100m I don't need it next year.",running

783,1622711853.0,Realising its okay to take it slow (well even slower) when getting back into running,"TLDR Realised that being injured doesn't just mean taking a break, but taking it slow when you start running again. Started run/walking 5-10ks and no longer feeling hip pain. 

What realisations did you have that helped you get back into running after a break or injury? 

Like a lot of people I took up running last year and worked my way up to half a marathon and running 5-6 days a week.

Everything was okay until I took a week off running in Mar as I had a hectic week at work (early morning to late evenings). I didn't think anything of it and went for a 10k run. Afterwards my hip ached with random sharp shooting pains.

I took a week off and tried running again and the same thing happened. So took two weeks off and the same thing happened again.

At this point I started fasting for Ramadan so decided to take a month off running.

Finally, got back into it last week. 

- Started a week with long walks (in addition to walking during fasting) and strength exercises / stretches focusing on my hip and lower body. 

- Started running only 1 mile at a time. Stopping to walk and then running another mile doing 5-10k a day. Rather than using Strava, Zombies Run, etc. I decided to either listen to a podcast or just listen to nothing and not think about times or being slower than I was before, etc.

It seems to be working for now. Rather than going straight back to 10k or more I will be slowly working my way back up and focusing on when my body tells me I need a break / slow down.

It is annoying as the temptation is always there to just run... But it also feels a lot better to be out and about without a running app.",running
784,1544906235.0,My Treadmill Broke,"My treadmill broke.

I got my treadmill nearly 15 years ago.  Being a new parent to twins, it was so convenient to take care of my kids and sneak in a quick run on the treadmill while they were napping, which was great.  I didn’t have to physically leave the house and I got my miles in.  Sure, I would run outside when my spouse was around, or if the grandparents were watching the kids, but more and more, I just stuck to the treadmill.  It was very convenient.

As my children got older and were enrolled in school, I would run outside, but it was still much less frequent.  Before I had my treadmill, there was nothing that stopped me from running outdoors.  I simply had no choice.  

Now.. well, it’s a bit cold outside.  I’ll just run on the treadmill.  

It’s too dark outside.  I’ll just run on the treadmill.  

A little bit of rain in the forecast?  Why fight it?  I’ll just run on the treadmill.  

Soon, with temperatures even being great, having beautiful sunny days, I’d still end up running on the treadmill anyway, catching up on a TV show while I was running, or listening to music.

All of this was my routine until a few weeks ago.  That was when my treadmill broke.

So here I was.  In need of a run and it was pretty cold outside.  This was definitely a treadmill day, if there ever was one.  But this time, I had no treadmill.  It was either suit up and go out, or skip the run.  I decided to suit up.

I put on some warm clothes, layered up, got my gloves and started out on my run.  About a block or two into my run, I was feeling such a sense of accomplishment, even though my run had hardly started.  Here I was, braving the elements.  Or rather the elements I kept thinking all these years were difficult.  It was actually not bad.  In fact, I was enjoying it.  I was soon getting warmer and I was loving the cold air hitting my face, the dog barking at me from inside someone’s house, a bus driving down the road, seeing geese flying overhead.  I kept running and I kept smiling.  And taking in everything around me.

“This is what running is all about, “ I said to myself.  “This… is running.”  Sure…. I had been running outside at times these past few years.  But the treadmill had made me avoid anything that almost wasn’t the perfect “day”.  All of the sights and sounds I described were with me on those nice days too.  But I hadn’t really noticed them.  Not until today.  I was running “with” the elements.  Not avoiding them.  This was what I did all of the time, for many many years.. before I had a treadmill.  And I had forgotten how great it was.

That was several weeks ago when I made that run.  Today, I just got back from a cold run in the rain.  And I loved it.

So yes, my treadmill is broke.  

And I am not getting another one.

785,1610218324.0,Winter runs and motivation,"Hello,

I live in Canada and as you may imagine, it gets pretty cold and the roads/sidewalks can be icy. I know a lot of runners who stop running during the winter season because they lose motivation and they think that it is « impossible » or very difficult to run outside.
This is the second year that I run during the winter season and I realized that I actually like it more than summer runs. Here are some reasons to keep running in winter:

1. Embrace it 

 Winter is painful if you don’t practice outdoor activities. Instead of hiding inside, a 30 min run will help you accept and maybe even like the season

2. Mental health 

I struggle with seasonal depression (every year) and I know that a lot of people do too. Going out for a run helps getting you exposed to the sun which helps with anxiety and depression.
Also, the pandemic has resulted in a surge of anxiety all around the world, give yourself an apportunity to release the negative energy with a run.

3. Beautiful landscapes 

Although snow landscapes can be gorgeous, it is not always the case when you live in a city. However, parks are usually pretty beautiful during winter. Sometimes, I plan my run and I try to be outside when snowing, it is pretty magical! The streets become empty, you feel the snow falling on your face and everything become white. I am not talking about big storms of course (stay safe and be careful) 

4. Keeping control of one thing

The last year has been tough for everyone. I felt like I lost control on everything: I could lose my job at any moment, I cannot plan things ahead, I cannot see my family and my friends, but something I know that was not taken from me is this moment of freedom when I can go outside, put on my headphones and run... sometimes for one or two minutes I feel like I am flying even if it is a short run and that moment is worth the effort. I am the only one responsible for these small moments of extreme happiness. I know that lockdown conditions are not the same for everyone but if you have the chance to run outside, take it.

If you need advices regarding gear and shoes, I liked this article :

https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a20825038/10-tips-to-make-winter-running-less-miserable/

Personally, I use my normal shoes (because the city removes the ice and snow pretty quickly) and I dress like it is 10 degree (celsius) warmer! 

Finally, listen to yourself. I run once or twice a week during the winter season because the conditions are not always right and I find it hard to find the motivation. I promised myself that I would run at least once a week with no performance expectation. I just want to keep the habit of running and give myself this break from time to time. 

I hope that this will help your motivation! Have a nice day everyone.

P.S: sorry if my english is not perfect, It is not my mother tongue.

Edit: please make sure to dress properly and to have the right shoes for your weather conditions. Also, I do not run during extreme conditions (extreme cold or snow storm). So adapt your routine to your running level and to your level of comfort. And remember, safety first!",running

787,1640988288.0,I (F28) ran (solo'd) my first half marathon today!!,"I can't get the race report template to work, so my apologies there. 

Date: December 31, 2021
Location: Central IL
Distance: 13.1 miles
Finishing time: 2:27:50

Goal one: finish it without dying or calling someone to scape me off the pavement
Goal two: sub 2.5 hours

Pre-run: I don't have a history of running (tried a few times but it didn't stick) I started running consistently 4 months ago. My schedule is 1 long run a week, 2 short runs, 1 strength day that's 20-40 min. I didn't follow a particular training program but consulted a lot of them and roughly stuck to 10% or lower weekly increases. I've been fully focused on building a base and strength training to avoid injury, not focused on speed yet. 

Run: I started slow hitting my times consistently. Though I ran the first mile or two slowish I tried padding a little extra time in on miles 3-6 suspecting I'd struggle at the end. I fueled the same way I did on my long training runs, 1/2 a pack of energy gummies every 2 miles and a few sips of water. Around mile 8 the wind really started picking up and I changed my route to stay in neighborhoods instead of a more open area I had planned. By mile 10 I was really having troubles with my left glute and could tell a problem area on my foot had likely blistered but clearly I wasn't going to let 3 miles get the best of me. I don't typically run through pain because I don't want to push myself to injury but I was determined to finish this damn run. My times on the last 3 miles suffered but I'm accepting it on a first go at this distance and I still hit my goal time. 

Post-run: sore as expected but feeling pretty great. I don't have pain anywhere in particular. My foot did blister and is pretty ugly but I was planning to take a few days off after this run so hopefully I can get it under control. 

I'm honestly still in a little shock because yes, the run was hard but somewhere in my mind is a voice that still says a half marathon is completely ridiculous, no one does that. But I DID THAT! Next year I'm going to bump up to 4 runs a week and incorporate some yoga into my schedule but for now I'm ordering pizza from my favorite place and chowing down.

Today I did an interval training, so there were three slots of walking for three minutes. I started my second walking slot when a car slowed down, the driver opened the window and shouted ""come on! you should run not walk!"". The exact same thing happened last week, when I was walking to cool down after a 11k run - non stop running. 

I get so frustrated thinking about this. I can't help but feel like the men were just making fun of me cause they thought I wasn't capable of doing a decent run without walking in between. 

I RUN. A LOT. Walking is part of the training. Just let me walk and let me be. Ugh",running
790,1597225747.0,Getting run over - lessons learned...,"So it happened this morning. I was just starting my morning run. I'd had a nice five minute warm up walk listening to some happy tunes on my phone, I checked my watch, pressed the button to start measuring my run, and trotted out to cross the road. Out of the corner of my eye I spotted a car bonnet coming towards me, and before I could think ""oh crap that's going to hit me"", I was sliding up the bonnet and then back down in to the road.

Very fortunately the car was slowing down to turn at a give way sign so the impact was very light. I ended up hitting the road with my elbow (the one I had surgery on last year!), but was up quickly and off to the side of the road. I think the driver was more shocked than me and was super apologetic about it all. We both calmed each other down and she headed off on her way (no damage to the car, none to me, no need to call the police or swap details).

I walked back home to debrief with my girlfriend and grab some water before heading out again for a second attempt at the run.

Lessons I learned:

\- Always wear something bright. It was around 8:30 am and the sun was out and very bright. I had assumed my fat sweaty ass would be very visible, but it wasn't. I was wearing all grey clothing - not my normal running gear as it was in the wash. When I checked the colour of my t-shirt, it was very close in colour to the tarmac on the road, not a good choice. The junction is a tricky one for visibility as a driver  - when I'm driving I tend to avoid it as it's a nasty hill start and usually has parked cars around it.

\- Even though I'm familiar with my route the unexpected can happen. I has assumed I was visible, I assumed that the danger on that bit of road was traffic turning in to the road I was crossing so I checked over my shoulder to spot for traffic behind me.

\- Stay alert. I was concentrating on starting my run, getting my smart watch recording, how humid it was this morning, and less on being safe.

\- Keep the volume on any music I'm using low. I couldn't hear the traffic just Boney M's Rasputin (yes disco sucks, but not enough to run me over).

I'm all in one piece, I completed my run after getting my breath back and calming down a little. I'm just relieved that this was a very minor thing but it's taught me some very useful safety tips. I never really thought how vulnerable I am as a runner but now I'll be more alert.

EDIT Thanks for the advice about getting checked out. I'm fortunate that I live in the UK and we have the NHS. I called their 111 service just now, they gave me some great advice, have recorded that this accident happened, and have let me know that there's no need to get down to the hospital. And also I realise that I was careless in not getting the driver's details, I was a bit too shocked to be thinking straight at the time but I now realise that was a mistake.",running

First (and possibly worst) there was the [Nike Oregon Project](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_Oregon_Project) where athletes were systematically doped and [abused to the point of medical danger](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/opinion/nike-running-mary-cain.html) - all of which was wilfully ignored by Nike at best, and [actively endorsed at worst](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/sports/mark-parker-nike-alberto-salazar.html).

Then there was the [AlphaFly controversy](https://amp.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/05/nike-air-zoom-alphafly-next-shoe), with Nike conveniently launching a new supershoe that *exactly* matched new shoe regulations that World Athletics had announced just days earlier. Despite [WA denying collusion with Nike](https://amp.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/world-athletics-foot-down-nike-running-shoe-regulations), the fact is that through these conveniently ""Nike-friendly"" regulations as well as aggressive patenting, Nike was essentially allowed to monopolize the supershoe market for the first few years of its existence. Other brands were forced to play catch-up, leaving non-Nike sponsored athletes in the cold with inferior products.

Of course, there's also Nike's infamous use of sweatshop labor which [first came to light in the 90s](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_sweatshops), and again more recently with Nike being one of the companies [linked to forced Uyghur labor in China](https://www.forbes.com/sites/siminamistreanu/2020/03/02/study-links-nike-adidas-and-apple-to-forced-uighur-labor/amp/). Obviously Nike isn't the only offender here, but it definitely adds another strike to the list.

Finally, there's my personal experience as a general practitioner having worked through the worst of the COVID crisis. At the time, several of my patients, who were employed at a large local Nike factory, reported independently of each other that they were forced to work in confined spaces, without masks or other safety measures in place. Several of them also reported being denied leave when they developed symptoms. Basically, these people were forced to either not comply with national regulations and put their own health *and* the health of others at risk, or otherwise lose their job.

In light of all of the above, [Nike's support of Colin Kaepernick](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonwingard/2019/07/17/nike-does-it-embracing-controversy-and-deepening-customer-relationships/?sh=6caaebf85863) after the ""taking a knee"" controversy, as well as the recent [suspension of their relationship with Kyrie Irving](https://nypost.com/2022/11/04/nike-suspends-relationship-with-kyrie-irving-after-anti-semitic-controversy/amp/) after antisemitic comments, appear to me to be nothing more than disingenuous whitewashing attempts.

Interested to hear your opinions on this. **To what extent do company ethics influence your running gear purchases?** Personally, I am happy to never, ever hand Nike a single dime of my money - even if that means I am denying myself some of the best-performing running products on the market.",running

795,1562329382.0,"I injured myself on the trail today, and tried to get back home.","So, long post. I just need to get this off my chest and can't wait for the complaints thread. Sorry if it's inappropriate. 

I usually run on roads, but sometimes I enjoy venturing out on the forest trails. Bad idea today. I was running down a pretty steep hill, my foot got caught on a root or something, and I proceeded to tumble down the hill quite a long way.

You know how you remember a hundred thoughts during a few seconds in moments like these? All mine were ""not my legs or knees, please not my legs!"". When I got up, my palms and elbows were bloody as hell, and I thought I'd broken a rib or something because it was painful to breath. But my legs felt fine. 

As I'm standing there, hands on hips, a couple comes by and the woman immediately upon seeing me shouts ""call an ambulance!"" Turns out I somehow had managed to smear blood all over my face from my palms, and in hindsight it must have looked pretty bad. After my continued reassurances that I was fine, they went on their way, but for some reason they didn't inform me (or I didn't hear) that my face was covered in blood. 

At this point I'm about 4km away from my home, and since my legs feel fine, I decide to walk/jog.

My path home takes me by an outside kindergarten play area, and as I passed by the fence, a kid starts screaming really loudly when he sees me, which made me jump. At this point I still don't know that my face is covered in blood. And for some reason my reaction was to start running away. 

So I'm running away from a screaming kid, face covered in blood, hurting from the bruises and my back, but in the end I made it back home.

Now a few hours later, my side kinda hurts, but I think I'm good. 

And most importantly, my legs are fine. I'll be road running for a while, I think.

EDIT: Thanks for all the encouragement and great replies! You guys made my day. I really hope I haven't scared anyone away from running trails. I do still love them, but will be more careful downhill from now on.",running
796,1536016196.0,Year of progress,Almost exactly one year ago today I weighed 300lbs couldn’t for a minute to save my life. I was a nervous wreck all the time. My feet were so swollen and my ankle hurt with every step. I was miserable. I decided I wanted to be a runner so I went to the gym and hoped on the treadmill and started jogging ten to twenty seconds at a time. It took until January for me to run my first entire mile without walking. It was a blazing 12 minute mile  and I was so proud of my self I wanted to cry. I didn’t give up. I kept adding time and mileage and I’ve lost weight now my furthest run is 5 miles and my fastest mile is 9:26. I’m going to keep training and see if I can do even better. Running might have saved my life and this group is a big part of it. Thank you everyone even lurkers make this group great.

801,1666415585.0,Consider becoming a running guide for a low vision or blind person,"I’ve run several marathons, but have lost most of my sight (though I’m in my 30s). I’ve lived in cities and small towns where there were lots of runners putting up their hands to offer to run with blind and low vision people, but I currently live in a city where people in the local running clubs are not really willing to help. I’m not the only blind runner in this town struggling to find help.  


I mention this, because if it is something you haven’t thought about trying, and if you like the accountability of running with another person, you might consider looking into local groups such as para-guides, who are often in search of volunteers. (Just google your city and “blind athletes,” “blind runners,” or “services for the blind” as a good starting point.) For me, all I would need would be someone I could follow who could call out when there’s no oncoming traffic on the footpath when we need to pass a walker or slower runner. Some blind people run loosely holding a tether rope or stretch band. Some connect to a leader by a string on the belt loop. There’s a lot of info online if you’re curious about the methods. It’s not a huge committment and I’m sure that the vision impaired and blind athletes in your area would be more than grateful.",running

803,1630371651.0,running as a minor. be careful yall.,"first post in this sub! first off, i gotta say, i LOVE this community. all i see is constant support and kind words being exchanged - thank you to the moderators who make it possible, and to the members who so kindly offer endless tips and tricks.

now, on a more negative note, it's time to share some of my experiences in running throughout a decently populated area. for reference, im a girl, a sophomore in high school, i have a rather athletic build, and i've been told i look much older than i really am. i run throughout a pretty active neighborhood, there's always people out and about. it's typically very friendly, and i feel overall safe running in it. 

i live in an area with hot summers - some days reach up to 105 degrees. i play soccer in the fall and run track in the spring, so the summertime is my main source of conditioning before my soccer season begins. because of this heat, i've opted to wear whats most comfortable to me: a sports bra and running shorts.

bad idea.

i've lost track of the amount of comments that have been made about me while i run: mentions of my body, face, form, you get the picture - all totally inappropriate things, primarily said by adult men.

this is not to say i don't get any positive, non-creepy comments while running - i love an occasional ""great work"" or ""keep it up"" while i push myself, as it motivates me to continue. this post isn't to tear down those who positively reinforce. comments like ""damn, sexy"" and ""slow down a second so i can get your number"" are not only inappropriate, but also serve as the opposite of motivation. how can i feel comfortable on a run if i'm scared of what i'll encounter? will it be a catcall? an unnecessary touch of physical contact? will another runner stride up next to me, and attempt to stay alongside me as i continue my route?

unfortunately, all things that have occurred to me at the age of 15.

i hate the fact that my clothing influences the type of experience i have on my run, however, it is not the only factor. i've tried running in a t-shirt and joggers, comments still get made. hoodie and a pair of shorts, still hear a whistle and an inappropriate comment. so please, do not accuse any runners of ""asking for it"" - it happens to so many people, regardless of gender, age, race, etc. 

this post serves several purposes: to provide examples of what's okay and what's not in terms of motivation amongst runners, to promote safety and remind you all that this can happen to anyone, as well as to document my own experiences and let others know that they aren't alone.

805,1585680220.0,Grandma's Marathon Cancelled - No refund & only 20% discount on next year,"Grandma's Marathon, scheduled for June 20, 2020, has been cancelled. The reasons for canceling are obvious and understandable. 

HOWEVER, I'm posting here because they apparently have chosen to keep everyone's money. This is the third marathon for which I was registered to cancel due to coronavirus, and the only one not refunding people's money. Also worth noting that this one has about 8 weeks more time than the other two. Here's their justification:

>In order to preserve our ability to continue to provide the Grandma's  Marathon experience to the running community for years to come, we must  uphold our no refund and no deferment policy. The time and effort that  goes into planning for race weekend are well underway, and a significant  portion of our expenditures have already occurred and are irreversible.   

Obviously, I'm disappointed in the cancellation. But hey, shit happens. I'm pissed off because they mention their own financial struggles as a reason for not refunding the money, completely dismissing the financial struggles of everyone who already gave them $134+.

The other marathons that cancelled are also run by small, non-profit companies with the same issues as Grandma's, but they offered a full refund or full deferral.

I want to report this as ""goods/services not received"" to my credit card company. I know I registered under a no refund/deferment policy, but I signed that as an assumption of my own risk to attendance (injury, conflict), and didn't think it applied to cancellation.

806,1588598501.0,My 4 diagnostics of running,"Mental, legs, cardio, and nutrition. During a run we start to feel like we're breaking down. I asses these 4 to see which one I think is coming up short. This is my theory I have developed running over 10 years from short runs up to marathon distance.

Mental - Is my mind just scared or being defeatist? This is the most common thing that holds me back. Maybe I have never run this far or fast before. Maybe I'm just not feeling confident today. If the other three are holding up, this is probably it. Ignore it and push on!

Nutrition & Hydration - Especially on longer runs (6+ miles for me) maybe it's just time for a gel or whatever nutrition I'm carrying. It's amazing the burst that can come from refueling with some water or calories. When I feel able to keep running but just generally tired, this is usually it. 

Cardio - Can I keep up my heart rate? This is more a challenge for beginner runners or during speed training. If I can't, just slow down a bit. If that doesn't do it, just walk a bit. Nobody is judging me except myself! I can give myself a break and try to run farther/faster next time.

Legs - This one is simple but deceiving. It comes more in to play on long runs. Do I have the leg strength/stamina to keep going? This is where the mental comes in. The answer is usually yes, but I may be trying to convince myself otherwise. ""Just keep the legs moving"" is what I tell myself.

It's just something I think about a lot and I thought it might be interesting to share. I'm curious what you think or if you asses yourself similarly.",running
807,1616238805.0,My running stroller saved me during Covid!,"Birthday run, in the bag this morning! We managed just under 30 km, which was not quite the distance I set out for, but that hardly matters. We’ve come a long way from where we started a year ago, and that feels pretty good. Kudos to my 1 year old son who kept me company for the first 10.

A year ago on my last birthday, my big gift to myself was a jogging stroller. We had just entered the early throes of quarantine, and at that point it wasn’t really clear where we were headed, how this situation would evolve, or how long it would last. I remember buying it sight unseen from the front of a bike store that I wasn’t even allowed to go into - and I bought it very reluctantly. My wife had encouragingly pushed the idea on me (which was nice), but it was expensive, took up a lot of space, and I had very little confidence that I would actually use it - at least not enough to justify buying it. But we did.

And in a Covid locked-down world, all of a sudden it made sense to give it a try. There wasn’t much else to do - and as a parent of young kids with suddenly not as much help around, self-improvement that also doubled as childcare was actually a clever stone that killed two birds at once. So off we went. I booked a recurring meeting with myself in order to block off my calendar every weekday at noon, and every day I went and ran with one of my two kids (1 and 4). Sometimes they alternated. Sometimes they both came (which was great, except for the whole pushing 100lbs of kids and gear part...) Often it made best sense to take my young son alone, since he loved to take his midday nap in the stroller, and sits very contentedly when he’s awake. So him and I mostly became running buddies, and we put in a lot of distance together.

Every weekday of this past year we’d run 5km at noon together out on the riverside trails in the valley next to our house - and I made it work by setting some pretty black-and-white rules for myself about running. Every day we go. No real exceptions, except for maybe an unavoidable work commitment or a genuine injury. We ran on days I was tired. We ran on days I wasn’t into it. We ran on days where my mind was elsewhere. We ran in the pouring rain, with my son bundled up under a plastic rain cover. We ran when there was snow and ice on the ground. We ran our first 10km in the howling wind, and our first 20km when it was -10 degrees out, with the kids bundled up in snowsuits and blankets, and me pushing my pace just to stay warm. The kids enjoyed bumping along looking at nature, napping, zoning out, or occasionally watching a coveted downloaded show on the iPad - and the people and other runners that we passed along the way all showed us love, smiling and waving at the kids, or nodding to me in encouragement, like it was all the more apparent that I was a tired middle-aged dad of 2 young kids, and this act of struggling behind them to push them along down the path was very emblematic of “making it work” in the circumstances. And it felt like that. We made it work.

And then there would be some days where the kids couldn’t come along - days when My daughter wanted to do something different with her lunch hour, or my son had already started a nap - so I went it alone. And when I ran alone, it was harder. It was always harder. I would always joke with my wife that I needed to be pushing that stroller because it made me feel less pressure to turn in a fast time - but the real reason was that pushing those kids has been my main source of motivation, and motivation is probably the one thing that a runner needs more than anything else. For me, running successfully has a lot more to do with having mental endurance and willpower than it does having physical capability. When I’d run alone, I’d run a fast km or two and then give up and walk it in - like I just couldn’t make myself want to keep going, even though my body certainly could. When I was pushing that stroller, it was different. Like somehow my (oblivious) infant son was learning a lesson in perseverance from me when I kept going and didn’t mail it in. Or maybe it had something to do with the fact that my kids are the main reason that I try to be a better man - try to be healthier, work harder, model good habits, and take better care of myself. It’s not every day that you get to literally carry your main sources of motivation along with you when you confront something difficult. Whatever it was, it made a lot of difference for me.

Anyway, the reason for sharing this is less about “Hey look, I did a thing” - and more about how it felt worthwhile to share, one year in, a positive story about something genuinely good that happened for me in a year that hasn’t been good in so many other ways. And some day, maybe even some day soon, I’ll return to an office, and my lunch hours will be absorbed into meetings - or my kids will grow older and no longer want to ride along with me (or even fit!) And I will miss this. 

Running this past year has been one of the things that really kept me going. Helped me stay fit at a time when I could have backslid. Helped me feel good about myself at a time when I didn’t. Gave me something to focus on when there wasn’t much else to do except focus on all the negative things happening around us. It’s been huge. And I think, as I reflect on it, that it only worked because I was able to keep it connected to the other things in my life that mean the most to me. For me, that’s the message that stands out the clearest. Self improvement is possible in a vacuum, I guess, but it’s so much more likely to succeed when you can give it a higher meaning. For me, that has everything to do with those kids that came along for the ride.

For any of you runners or aspiring runners out there who are also parents to be, or already have young kids, obviously I just can’t recommend it enough.

Edit: Wow, guys - thanks for all the love. Seriously, I had no idea, but I’m so glad to hear that this post resonated with so many of you - and especially thrilled to hear that it motivated some of you to get out there and hit the open road with your own kids.

Between work, being sick, my Dad being in the hospital and almost dying, a family vacation, I haven't gone for a single run in 29 days. Until just now.

812,1592558030.0,How I got a sub-19 min 5 km in 1 year of training,"Hi there fellow runners!

Yesterday I did a 5 km time trail with a running friend and I somehow managed to smash my previous by about 40 seconds PB with a time of 18:24. I'm over the moon as I really surprised myself with this time but more importantly I thought that this experience and my training schedule might be useful for those wanting to get quicker. I feel I've made particularly big gains over the last 6 months or so when I really changed my training up so I thought I'd share how my training has taken me from running 5Ks at \~20:30-21:00 just under a year ago to looking towards the 18 min barrier for my next PB.

I've put a summary/TL;DR at the bottom if you want the highlights but I've provided some detail here to hopefully give some insight into a schedule that might useful for you!

**Quick background**

I'm male and I'm 27 years old. I've always been somewhat of a runner but I hadn't really committed to the sport until about 18 months ago when I decided to sign up for a half marathon. I did some training for that but to be honest, I didn't know what I was doing and most of my running revolved around playing football (soccer) plus one or two 10-15 km runs a week. Following this, my friend recommended I joined a club last summer and since then I've been improving fairly quickly. However, things really took off for me when I decided to a marathon and it's roughly this schedule that I've been following and honing for the last 6 months.

**Training Schedule**

Firstly, my weekly distance is about 75-80 km. I think it's important to get up to this ball park distance (though I know this amount of training isn't always required by everyone) as I found just getting miles in my legs, especially getting used to running on tired legs, has been immensely beneficial for my total running game. I've also tried going higher than this (up >100 km per week) but I've found my body isn't quite ready for it. This \~75 km is usually spread over 5 days a week, with two rest days. However, most importantly this doesn't just include running. About 3 months ago I started to practise yoga on my own using YouTube videos (I use the channel 'Yoga with Adriene'). I was (and probably still am) terrible at it, however, I found it's incredible for recovery as well as massively increasing my core and upper body strength and it's this part that I'd highly recommend to you all. I do it 3-4 times a week for 15-30 min at a time and I can't recommend it enough. **Do yoga!**

In terms of sessions my week usually consists of the following:

1 x Interval Session which includes hard efforts with (usually) static recoveries. This used to be on a track until everything shut down from Covid so now this is usually based on grass. Grass is great to lower the impact on your joints but does make some efforts slightly harder. Example sessions include 3 x (1, 3, 2, 4 min efforts) with 1 min recoveries, or 8 x 2 min efforts with 1 min recoveries.

1 x Tempo Session. I used to these as part of a normal run on roads but recently I've now changed to do this on grass as well and I think this has been important in reducing impact and making the sessions more manageable. Example sessions include warming up with 5 x 10 seconds of strides, 3 x 8 min tempo efforts with 2 min recovery jogs in between. Another option that I'd sometimes add in would be a 45-60 min progression run if I didn't fancy doing an interval session.

1 x Long Run. My long run would usually be minimum 21 km and more often around 25 - 30 km. This would be easy but based on feel so this could be anything from an average pace of 5-5:15 min/km if I was tired or up to 4:35-4:45 min/km if I was feeling good. Additionally, I found it was really great to try and up my pace in the last 3-5 km of these runs, particularly if I was doing a slow pace.

All remaining running is easy including 2 x dedicated easy runs. To and from my efforts sessions (tempo and intervals) usually involve easy runs (3-5 km each way) which are at the same pace as my 2 x easy runs per week. These runs initially were based upon feel and varied in pace much like my long run but I did start to battle with chronic injuries so I've recently (in the past month or so) switched these to be low heart rate runs in line with the Maffetone Method. This mixed method of some MAF training with hard effort sessions seems to be what's making the biggest difference as of late. Not only am I increasing my aerobic capacity with the MAF training, it's also lowering the load on my body to allow me to go harder in my efforts sessions. I think this might be the key to long term success here.

**Other Additional Tips**

I've recently also found that integrating a recovery week every 4-5 weeks in my schedule helps me keep on top form and stay pretty fresh. For me I play the recovery week by ear, listening to what my body feels like it needs, if I feel okay, I'll just lower my total km to \~40 km. If I'm feeling some injuries or niggles a bit, I'll lower my total km but also not do any hard efforts sessions and just do a full week of MAF training. I'll also make sure to give myself days off from activity completely so not even yoga to ensure my body can relax and recover.

**Summary**

* Get a decent amount of weekly distance in your legs on a regular basis (I recommend \~60-80 km)
* Mix up your training - include hard efforts sessions, long runs and low heart rate running to maximise the benefits of your training
* Do yoga regularly for strength and recovery
* Enjoy your running!

First and foremost because of the use of ""huffing and panting"" like all of us are animals in max mode always out of breath. I've seen unfit WALKERS huffing and panting, but no mention of those of course. This clearly comes from a place of self-righteousness.

Secondly, because I've been an outdoor runner for some years and I don't believe \*most\* runners are the problem. I can't tell you how much I constantly play red rover with groups who are either clueless of their surroundings or can't be bothered to make room on the sidewalk. Or people with headphones in staring at their phones. I'm always careful to be accommodating for bikes and people, I stick to one side of the road or sidewalk, not down the middle like many of these people.

Anyway, rant over. I just had to share and hope to get some validation or perspective from fellow runners who probably feel the same. Tensions are high and running is my therapy.


Edit: just want to clarify my frustration is over groups or dog leashes or whatever shouldn't be there that block the sidewalk. Not just people walking in general.

We started running together a few months back and it has hugely improved our relationship. It gives us an excuse to be extra proud of each other. It gives us something to connect about and it gives us something tough yet rewarding to share.

At first I wasn't sure about whether it was possible, what kit I needed, whether I was just having a premature mid-life crisis, if there were any accounts of people doing similar journeys and countless other things.

&nbsp;

Everyone came together and gave me some amazing advice, pointed me towards subreddits, books and people that have helped me immensely. So firstly I'd like to thank everyone for their help and inspiration, you all gave me the confidence to leave my job and pursue this insane adventure (holding you all responsible if it doesn’t work out).

&nbsp;

I've been training properly for around 2 months now, I've gone from huffing and puffing on a 10k to running a 50k Ultra Marathon. I've lost toenails, got tendonitis, pulled muscles, twisted ankles and all the rest. I've spent a lot more money on ultra light kit than I expected, and finally I'm just a few small pieces away from having my completed pack, currently weighing in around 11-12kg with food and water inc.

&nbsp;

Due to my lightweight pack I’ve decided against taking a trailer or a stroller, I was interested in these options but in the end they all worked out too costly, and I was concerned they might limit my route to predominantly roads. The downside of this is more strain on my legs, and I’m less likely to draw attention to myself and the charity (hoping to use some flags, like Eddie Izzard instead)

&nbsp;

I’ll mainly be wild camping along the way, mixing in an occasional AirBNB when I need to shower and sleep in a real bed.

&nbsp;

I’ll be joined from time to time by some friends and some redditors who were interested in my last post, and I’ll contact local running groups via other subreddits to break up the solo stretches along the way.

&nbsp;

Currently resting and trying to overcome some tendonitis issues, so training has slowed down and is mainly high intensity cross training instead of running. Any tips for nutrition, recovery and gear would be greatly appreciated!

820,1515332652.0,Why I love running on a treadmill ...,"... said no one, ever.

I hate it, but here are some advantages over road running that I try to keep in mind when I have to run on the treadmill. Please add to the list! Maybe we can all hate it a little bit less.

* No traffic: cars, bikes and pedestrians rarely seem to interfere with my treadmill run.
* No need to stop for intersections
* No need to plan out a route
* Keeping a known, steady pace is easier
* I've never gotten lost while running on a treadmill
* No need to check the weather for choice of running clothes
* No need to carry food or water
* Surrounding noise tends to be more constant, so music/podcasts are easier to listen to
* You can run *any* distance -- and still be right where you were when you left!

821,1508688760.0,A reminder that mile 1 is a liar.,"I start training for my first half marathon in 2 weeks. To prepare, along with my training calendar I stick up on medicine cabinet, I plastered it with motivational running quotes. One up there says ""never believe the first or second to last miles- they are liars"" I love it. 

I've been having a shin act up with splints again that I've been really worried will ruin my half marathon plan. After 5 days off to nurse it I set off to run 5 miles this morning. The first was terrible, I kept telling myself I couldn't do it. I was feeling sorry for myself and about turned back home with the excuse my shin wasn't ready. I remembered the quote though and decided not to make any decisions about quitting until mile 1 was over.

Got through mile 1 of course and finally settled into my run. I completed the 5 I intended to with a couple PRs to boot.

Never listen to mile 1, he's a liar.",running
822,1658579479.0,Tracking my heart rate has made me miserable,"I started running 2 years ago. Lost a ton of weight in the process.

One issue was that my heart rate was always high. Like even on easy runs, I'm always between 165-175 (I'm in my late 30s). But not dying or anything, I can comfortably run for 10 miles. And when everyone else had HRs in the 150 range at my pace (11:30/mile), mine never changed. FYI, my HR has a max of 195bpm on a hill test. 

I figured if I wanted to become a better runner (better pace at lower HR), I had to work on my aerobic base (because i seemed to be stuck at 11:30/mile fr the longest time). And I did. I ran slow at sub-150bpm for more than 8-10 months. Nothing fucking changed. And chasing that heart rate change worsened my already slow pace. And that, in turn, made my the HRs of my hard runs go up higher, since the effort is significantly more for them.

Today, I had enough, and I switched off the heart rate views from all my screens. I will run by feel, because I've been researching for a whole fucking year and I simply can't figure out why my heart rate is so high.

This is fucking voodoo. I bought high end watches and HR monitors to figure this shit out, and I'm just done at this moment, because it's taken the joy out of something that makes me very happy. I wish I could evolve, I wish I could become a better, faster runner. But I think I'll have to accept that I can't. 

I'm posting to see if anyone else has been in my shoes. It's very disheartening to see everyone have such healthy relationships with stats and use those stats to evolve and improve. People who started with me are already running 9:30/mile marathons. I can't seem to. I will run blind, because its either that or quitting running.",running
823,1632144563.0,I love this hobby and sub. I managed to go from painful 2.5k runs to comfortable 10k runs in 5 months. Here is how I learned to love running:,"1. I will never be a pro runner. So I do not have any apps that measure my distance/time. I just run/walk.

2. I run every 2/3 days, no matter the weather. I enjoy running through rain/snow/sun. I don’t have a real schedule, but I try to always take time for 2/3 runs a week, no matter how long/short the runs are or how fast I run.

3. I got my phone and bluetooth headphones with me. If I run in a foggy forest, I listen to crime podcasts/audiobooks. For snow, I got a Christmas playlist.

This makes such a difference to me. I mark my starting position in Google Maps so I can discover whatever place I want. 

I discovered so many places in my own town that I never knew about and Google Maps just brings me back to my home. 

4. I managed to change my diet JUST so I can run/walk my favorite trails more comfortably. Running+ a good diet fits together amazingly. 

I am lighter/faster and feel better and all these things help with easier runs. Keep running regularly, it worked for me! I did a 20k yesterday after 6 months of running. 

I also discovered new music styles/bands/book genres. I am a busy person so having 3 hours to listen to audiobooks/music/podcasts is rare for me. 

I’m listening to the Lord Of The Rings audiobook atm and having all this entertainment with me is great during the runs.

5. Run in the early morning/at night/in the snow. I am really excited to run in the snowy city at night. I ran through a rainy forest without headphones and the nature sounds are so calming. 

I have been running through dark forest trails/the city and it is amazing how quiet a city can be at night. When running at night through a forest, I like having some kind of horror podcast on/zombie sounds.

6. Mark your favorite running spots! I save my favorites every time so I will always know where to run. But also try new areas! I love discovering new trails/waterfalls. Strava shows you popular running spots people use.

I went from running to loose weight to really loving this hobby because of these things. It is a great feeling to make progress and being faster than a month ago.

824,1569171415.0,TIFU by not realizing what a 'trail run' actually entails,"(stealing this from a previous post for context): I started running in April-- I'm in pretty good health, and one of my friends got me up for a hike, then a run; soon a 5K run became a 10K, and then an eight miler. Twenty-five miles a week is pretty average, and around six-eight miles is comfortable. At the beginning of October, I have a half marathon in Hampton, NH, and to prepare, signed up for the 11th Annual Trapp Lodge Trail run (10k) in Stowe, VT. The evening, and morning prior went swimmingly, and normally like my few previous races. Stowe at seven am was foggy, and immaculate.

SO normally I run in suburban Burlington-- mostly paved, slight rolling hills here, and there... I've never run on a trail. I'll hike, go on a nice trail walk. I don't know how I overlooked ""trail run,"" on the website... I figured it was like, dirt roads over rolling hills in beautiful Stowe- I thought the course map were roads around the lodge, amongst the fields with cows. No-- it was up a ski trail on a very large hill... with rocks,  branches, and potential for falling. I really went for it at the first hill.... and then realized there were like six more. RIP calves- I did some walking because I didn't want to really cramp anything, esp with the Hampton run in a few weeks.... a very kind runner passing by, who I told that this was my first trail run, said I was doing the right thing.Downhill was just as terrifying!

Update: 

Some details I found after the sale date. There were only 31 pairs available. There were different qualifying times for men and women. Your time allowed you to enter the drawing for your size.

AFAIK there were no PR releases, official social media posts or other marketing activities other than a display in the  Harajuku store. Given that, does it count as a marketing event to build hype if you don't tell anybody about it? I'm guessing that the article's writer had a source at the store and if it weren't for that, nobody outside of a very small group of people would have known about it.

I'm more leaning towards this was a fun little thing for them to do for participants of the Tokyo marathon.

835,1629483226.0,What I learned running every day for a year!,"I hit one my my proudest milestones last week, 365 days of running in a row. The shortest run was 1mile the day after my Marathon, and the longest was a solo 50k I did in November of last year. Here are a few of the things I learned...

&#x200B;

* You absolutely **need** to be able to ""run easy"" to streak run. You no longer have true rest days, which means you need to be able to do legitimately easy recovery runs.
* You learn a ton about what excuses you tell yourself for skipping a run. When I moved to trying to extend a steak, suddenly all the excuses seemed pretty hollow. I wasn't willing to throw away 60 days because I felt ""off"", or ""lazy"", or ""tired""
* You learn how to plan for times when it IS going to be a challenge to get your run in. Whether it's an early run in the rain before a flight, or the day of your wedding, or a late run on moving day. You make a plan, and figure out how to fit in that run.
* You learn how to run through niggling pains, and how to dial your training back to avoid injuries. The single most important factor in keeping a streak alive, is avoiding injury. You learn to tune in to the minor aches, the sore knee, the tight calves; and you learn how to adjust the intensity of your running to allow yourself to recover.
* You learn to run in all sorts of awful conditions. I've run in everything from 20F to 106F. I've run in a tropical storm rain, a freeze that knocked out the power grid, humid and hot summers, and in more pouring rain than I can count.
* You learn to really appreciate the days it all comes together, when the weather is perfect, or you crush an interval, or you run a solo race. When everything just clicks and your knock it out of the park.
* Piling on the mileage, (25mpw in the year prior to 55mpw in the last year) really pays dividends. I'm a much better runner now, than I was at this time last year, and I'll be an even better runner another year from now. Consistency matters. Alot.

&#x200B;

And I'll leave you with this long(ish) quote from Matt Fitzgerald's excellent 80/20 Running:

&#x200B;

>The most effective way to improve as a runner, as you already know, is to follow the 80/20 Rule. The second most effective way to improve is to run more. Once you have corrected the intensity balance in your training, consider increasing your running volume. If currently you run only three or four times per week, set a goal to run six or seven times per week. According to the World Health Organization, daily aerobic exercise is required for maximum all-around health. As a runner, you might as well meet this requirement by running. Not only will your health improve but your running will too.  
>  
>Once you’re consistently running six or seven times per week, a sensible next step is to increase the average duration of your runs to one hour. When you reach that point, you’ll be running a total of six or seven hours per week. You can cover a lot of ground in six or seven hours. If your average pace is ten minutes per mile, you’ll run forty-two miles in a seven-hour training week. By running longer one day per week, you can get your total weekly running volume closer to fifty miles.  
>  
>Take your time building your running volume. The body’s tolerance for the stress of running increases slowly. It’s best to err on the side of caution and proceed even slower than you think you could. Aim to boost your average weekly running volume by no more than ten miles from year to year. Even at this cautious rate, you can go from twenty miles per week to sixty miles per week in four years.  
>  
>Each runner has a personal running volume limit, which is usually greater than the runner’s current limit. If your ultimate goal is to become the best runner you can possibly be, then you’ll want to continue to increase your running volume until your current limit merges with your final genetic limit. This is the point beyond which there is no possibility for further improvement by means of additional running. Typically it takes many years of cautious and consistent development for a runner to reach this limit, which, again, is different for each of us.  
>  
>Outside of the elite ranks, few runners discover their personal maximum running volume. Running just isn’t important enough for most recreational runners to make that kind of commitment. Each runner must decide how much time and effort he’s willing to commit toward improvement. I am not going to badger you into running more than you want to, but I would like to persuade you to want to run more than you do today. And if I can’t do that, then at the very least I would like you to recognize that running more is always available to you as your best option for improvement once you’re following the 80/20 Rule. If you don’t care to run more now, you can always change your mind at some point in the future.

Well, another year has passed, and yesterday I hit the 730 day milestone. When I stop and think about it, I am a little humbled that it's all come together for me for so long. The longer I run, the more I think of this time as a blessing; and the more I'm appreciative I am of the things I've learned from those who have suffered so I didn't have to!

Some thoughts on the last 2 years, in no real particular order:

* Discipline and motivation;  they are both important. Often I see posts on /r/running about how to find the motivation to run, and inevitably the community will respond with the adage that motivation gets you started and discipline keeps you going. I would argue this over simplifies the relationship between the two, and that we can fail to explain how discipline can generate motivation.   
I never would have run every day for a month relying on motivation alone. I needed discipline to tell me to get my shoes laced up and get out the door every day. But over time, maintaining my discipline became a new source of motivation. I was *motivated* to stay disciplined. This generates a sort of positive feedback loop that can be really powerful.  
In addition to the complex relationship between discipline and motivation, I think motivation serves a regenerative purpose. My motivations change, as time moves on. Run a marathon. Run a 5k. Run a sub 25min 5k. Run  a Marathon. Qualify for Boston. Win a race. Beat my PR. Run 200 miles in a month. Run a 100 miles in a Week. These motivations are short, focused, temporary. I get motivated to attack a challenge, and I use discipline to stay on track for that challenge. Without the ever-changing, ever-new motivations, the discipline required would grow to heavy, and become a burden that would eventually overmatch me. The motivation to accomplish new things rejuvenates me, and reduces the burden of that discipline to a manageable and achievable level. 
* Run/Life Balance is a challenge, and an constantly evolving puzzle. Right now, I'm in a position where I can lean into running in a way that many people cannot. I don't have the demands of children on my time, and my wife is supportive. I work from home. One of the things I'm still working at learning, is that running can be a secondary or tertiary priority in my life, and still be important to me. For a long time, I was wrapped up in my daily numbers, weekly numbers. My year over year change, and the improvement I am seeing. I am starting to let go of that piece, and just enjoy that I am doing what's right for me *now.* Running more than I ran last August is great, but it isn't that important. What's important is if I'm giving everything to running right now that I *want* to give relative to other time commitments.  
Running every day isn't for everyone, because for every person, running falls into a different set of constraints, needs, desires and challenges. What is important is if you look back at your training and can say ""I'm happy with the effort I gave. I didn't flake out, and I made running the priority I wanted it to be."" Maybe that means three days a week. Maybe that means 100 miles a week. Either way, if you're satisficed you put into it what you were capable of , given your personal constraints, you should be proud.
* I've played around with shoes a lot over the last two years. I'm a firm believer in two things related to running shoes: 1) I replace mine after about 400 miles. I notice more niggling in my legs after shoes hit this mark, and I really value feeling good. I'm willing to spend the extra money to not deal with it. 2) I really think you should change up what shoes your running in often. I like to have 2-3 different pairs of easy day / long run shoes with different stack heights, different drops, etc. I think forcing your feet to work in different ways every week is really beneficial.
* You can have really bad days/weeks/blocks, but still improve. My coach often says one bad workout doesn't ruin a block. In the same way, a bad block doesn't ruin your fitness. Even if the results don't show up on race day, they may present themselves in the next block. Don't get discouraged if you're putting in the work; putting in the work is 3/4 of the battle.

839,1622214208.0,I Ran a 5K for 32 Consecutive Days,"Hello everyone! 

As the title states, I ran a 5K for 32 consecutive days. I wanted to share with you all the results and the rationale behind this personal challenge. Hope you enjoy! 

**Background:** 

I've never been much of a runner. As a matter of fact, I pretty much hated it. The thought of running a mile and finishing it without stopping just seemed daunting. About a third of the way into the mile, I would want and need to stop to catch my breath. However, my mentality towards running changed sometime around October of 2020. I have a couple of coworkers who are super into running and they recommended that I pick up running to lose excess weight and increase my overall endurance. 

Looking at my Strava, I see that my first run was a little over 3 miles with an average pace of 10:55/mi (back in early October of 2020). I then went on to complete a 23 day training regimen, where I ran 3-5 times a week and my runs ranging from 2-6.5 miles. The last day of this training regimen was sometime around mid December and I ran 3.28 miles with a pace of 8:40/mi. 
That was the last recorded run I have to finish off 2020.

I started 2021 by signing up for a running challenge, Winter Warrior Challenge. For those of you who are unaware of what this is, it's a running(and/or walking) challenge where you have to run/walk outside at least 1 mile a day during the month of January. Looking at my stats on Strava, I did a total of 201.56 miles in January. I did a total of 49 walks and 24 runs. Here is a [picture](https://imgur.com/yg4kALg) of the calendar where I kept record of my walks and runs. 

I think the push to get to above 200 miles (also factor in the brutal winter the Northeast saw this year in February) really burned me out and for the entire month of February, I ran a total of 13.14 miles. March saw some improvement and I ran a total of 35.97 miles. Prior to April 26 (the first day of my 32 day 5K) challenge, I only ran once in April and that was on April 8 for 3.28 miles with a pace of 8:50/mi. 

**Why Did I Run a 5K for 32 consecutive days?**

As you can see from the information above, after the Winter Warrior challenge and leading up to the first day of my 32 day 5K challenge, I only ran a total 52.39 miles. I was in a slump. I gained weight. I needed to do something to get out of this slump and get back into consistent running. I turned 32 on April 25th and I decided that I wanted to challenge myself mentally and physically by running a 5K every day for 32 straight days. I wasn't sure what I was expecting and wasn't too sure if I would stick to it, but I saw no harm in trying. 

**Results** 

Here's the [link to the Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT21S0WhmzJJQhQQxom7iM1BMDrU_aXrsyGKVD-fFN7PN4aYYWvE6gaJ-T9JI1ekqFD-uqn851IgF38/pubhtml) that shows the data. I also put how many calories I burned and the exercise minutes for each day. Just FYI, I weight trained the days where I have longer exercise minutes.

* My PR for a 5K was 24:48 (which I achieved on 5/16) 
* I lost 17 lbs (235lbs to 218lbs)
* Here's a [before and after picture](https://imgur.com/91UO6y2) 

**Reflection**

I'm incredibly proud of what I achieved. I didn't necessarily have the most difficult time with motivating myself, but I did struggle with some aches and soreness. When you take a look at the Spreadsheet, you'll see that 5/17-5/19 is highlighted in red because my back was hurting, which explains the slower times. I wanted to keep the challenge going, so I ran slower. 

I'm happy with losing 17 lbs. This challenge also pushed me to clean up my diet and I even tracked my calories for the entirety of the challenge. 

I'm excited that it's over with, however. I'm looking forward to a few days of rest, but I intend to keep running, just not every day! 

**Looking Ahead** 

I do not want to repeat what I did after my Winter Warrior challenge and decrease my mileage dramatically. I intend to keep running at least 20 miles a week. I have an interest in running a half marathon by mid July, so I might start training for that. I also want to run a marathon, but I understand how much training and cross-training goes into that. My coworkers mentioned one in October of 2021, so if I keep at it, I think I should be able to run it. 

Hope you enjoyed reading about my journey! I hope this serves as an inspiration for those who want to get into running or continue on with their running. If any of the more experienced runners have advice on how I can keep this progress and build upon it, it is most welcomed. 

Thank you everybody and have a great day!",running
840,1613764473.0,80/20 seriously worked some magic for me!,"I've been running consistently for 8-9months now. I plateaued after about 4 months and didn't really improve neither my speed or endurance for several weeks. I wasn't doing any structured running as such, just running 5k 2-3 times per week trying to be faster than last time every time.

I hit a 29min 5k and just couldn't cut that time further...no matter how hard i tried, i always managed to hit ~29min (28:58 was my PB). A sub 30min 5k was my original goal, so i was reasonably satisfied for a while. 

I learned about 80/20 in the beginning of 2021 and have been trying to follow it since. I've been feeling like i wasn't improving *at all* for the past 6-7 weeks, but i stuck with it despite feeling like I was treading water. My easy pace is still slow as shit, it doesn't feel any easier. 

Well, today was the day I needed to see if anything was actually happening, or if i was just pounding pavement with nothing to show for it. 

I shaved ***3:33*** off my previous 5k PB and did it in 25:25!!...i was baffled that i had gained this much in such a short time frame, especially since i have not noticed improvement in my daily running.

841,1595504964.0,Why is running such a powerful anti depressant?,"Just curious if anyone has any articles or reasoning to share behind why running works excessively well as an anti depressant for me. 

In particular, steady state low intensity running over 40 minutes is life changing. 

I’ve even tried prescription anti depressants and never gotten results like when I’m able to maintain my running. Prescriptions have side effects and weight gain, running has none and you lose weight/get healthier. 

The only downside being that when I can’t run, or I get injured, it’s bad news. 

I’ve even tried other versions of cardio in similar intensity ranges and they just don’t work like running does.

842,1610428032.0,did my first run in 10 months today.. (small achievement),"(excuse format/grammar as i’m on mobile)

So i (18F) did cross country/track in high school (graduated in 2020). Just last year in february before corona, i did a 10 mile run at 6:55 mile pace and was feeling great for the upcoming track season. 
My personal best in the 3 mile was a 17:57 when i was 16 (november 2018) just to give you an idea what type of shape i was in compared to..now. 😬
As soon as the pandemic hit and track was canceled, i quit running forever due to the lack of motivation, and i was also struggling with bulimia (won’t go in depth, but it was real bad).

These past 10 months have been spent locked in my room, doing online school,and never leaving my house.
Well, today i ran on my treadmill, barely doing one mile in 7:32....it was a wake up call for me as i realized how out of shape i’m in, but it also made me notice how much i’ve missed running, and now i can actually enjoy it since i’m not competing or training for time anymore. i’m building up my mileage slowly and hope to get to 5 miles in 2-3 months without stopping!


Q: do you have any recommendations on how i can build my way back up without getting injured? how fast i should increase the mileage? I don’t know how effective muscle memory is, but i hope it makes it easier to get back into running and all.

Thanks!

Edit: thank u kind strangers for the awards, advice, and support! I was feeling pretty demoralized, but now i’m accepting that it’s going to take a while to get back out there and that’s fine. Also, i know a 7:30 mile is faster than average, i guess i said i felt out of shape due to how tired and out of breath i was by the half mile point-where as before, it would’ve felt like nothing. However, i’m done comparing myself to my past self. Thank you once again. ❤️",running

845,1528707342.0,Half Marathon - How I went from 1:55 to sub 1:30,"I’ve lurked on these forums for quite a while, and always found plenty inspiration and things to think about. Perhaps it’s time to give something back?

Happy to answer any questions or provide any advice, if people would like!

**Background** 

Back in late 2012, I was about to turn 30 and felt like I needed a challenge to try and fend off the realisation of getting old! I had been in a pretty major road accident six years earlier and had been told that I’d probably not be able to play sport again – I had slowly managed to get back to playing a bit of soccer, but I was ready for a bigger challenge.

There is a race in my city each February, and I had walked the 7km a couple of times before, so it was an easy choice – now I just had to train! Stupidly, I left starting my training until quite late and as a result, I probably overtrained a little trying to fit 12 weeks into 8 weeks.

The hard work did pay off, and I managed to get home in 1:55:51.

I was pretty happy with my time, but pretty sore by the end, so I thought I had gone as hard as I could. When I looked at the results and saw people finishing sub 1:40, I thought that was witchcraft – I had no chance of running anything like that. So I quit running, and didn’t do another half marathon for 3 years.

Fast forward to last weekend, and after a solid training regime I ran 1:29:35, breaking 90 minutes in my 8th half marathon.

**What did I learn?**

1. You are faster than you think. As I said, 1:40 seemed impossible in 2013, never mind 1:30! But a lot of running is mental. It took a long time for me to get my head around the fact that I had the potential to run faster than 5.00/km, but once I did suddenly big races seemed easier and my times got quicker.

2. Listen to your body. If you feel sick or sore, listen to your body. Prepping for one race, I went for a 10km run with a heavy cold, as I didn’t want to miss a session. I ended up missing 2 weeks, as the cold got worse. Some days are rest days.

3. Watch what you eat. I lost 10kg, and suddenly running was a lot easier, and I got a lot quicker. The pressure on my knees and hips dropped away. I also started thinking about what I ate on the morning of a race (banana, white bagel and honey, water), then the night before a run (chicken, egg, avocado, bagel, zucchini), then the week before (hydrating, not too much fibre, spice or fat). These things make a difference.

4. Vary your training. Early on, someone told me to run lots of slow miles to get better. Unfortunately, they didn’t tell me to run any fast miles, hills, tempo etc. I got away with it initially as my city is very hilly, but the reality is that you need to do speedwork, hills, long runs and steady runs. There is no magic weekly mileage – I almost got there on 30 miles a week, but I’m closer to 40 mpw now.

5. Join a club. I spent two years saying “I’m too slow to join a club!” Turns out I was too slow because I wasn’t in a club. I didn’t have anyone to push me, encourage me, or give me advice. You don’t have to join something official – just find some reliable running buddies with common goals!

6. Don’t get obsessed. I’ve heard of people getting disillusioned after spending years trying to break a PB, or BQ or whatever. If you hit a plateau, change your focus and see if that helps. I only ran 1 half marathon in 2017, as I decided to concentrate on my 5k and 10k times. This meant more speedwork and more events, but it also helped my half marathon time. Had I not broken 90 minutes this weekend, I wasn’t going to try again in 2018 – I have a marathon to train for, so that training would probably also get me sub90 for a half as well.

7. Remember to have fun. Sometimes you learn more from events where you aren’t worried about performance. I agreed to pace someone for my second HM, with a target time of 2:15. I still took training seriously, but on race day, I helped someone else, enjoyed the run and soaked up the atmosphere. It was just as much fun as breaking 90!

8. You do you. Be careful who you take advice from – there is no silver bullet and everyone is different. Some people will need high mileage to reach their goals, others don’t. Some people need gels, beans or whatever, some people need a mouthful of water.

9. Pick your race. If your local race is a hilly monster, and the race 2 hours away is flat and fast, get in the car! Some people might think this isn't in the spirit of it, but it is a good strategy to get good times!

10. Running is awesome. And frustrating. Sometimes both of these things on the same day.

My entire childhood was spent sick and mostly indoors playing video games.  The doctors could never fully find out what exactly was wrong at any given time, but had diagnosed me with an auto-immune disorder as well as asthma, among other things.  It led to depression and the genuine belief my life wouldn't end up being too long.  I had to leave the public schools to homeschool after getting surgery.

After slowly building my stamina working at a restaurant and taking short hikes, I wanted to overcome my life of inability and sickness to become my own person.  I started jogging and over the course of a year was able to run 5k on a treadmill in 32 minutes.  I transitioned to running outside and made my first full 3.1 miles around the local lake at 10pm back in March.  The race was just a month after that. 

The day of the race was 50 degrees with pretty heavy rain for central Oklahoma.  It was so difficult getting through the first mile, but I was in complete disbelief when they shouted ""8 minutes 10 seconds!""  
I came in 43rd overall out of 592 people!  My finish time was 25:20.  The last mile was the best but also the worst because I was crying on and off from the sheer pride of being able to race.  I spent the rest of the day tearing up and feeling so lucky to be alive.

850,1616434494.0,Forrest Gump running pace?,"There have been previous discussions on how long did Forrest run, and even his probable pace given that the period of time he ran is known (e.g. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/232hjy/request_how_many_miles_did_forrest_gump_run/)). However, I find nowhere an analysis that actually looks at him *running* (see link below). So, based solely on the actual footage and your experience, what is the most probable pace of Forrest running? My educated guess is 8:26-8:42 min/mi (5:15-5:25 min/km). 

(Video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E862LsAxTK4), from 1:30 — pay special attention to the seasoned-Gump pace in 3:30 and 5:15).

**Edit 1**: Thank you very much for so many valuable insights. I am most amazed with the level of dedication in many responses. I am going to digest your analysis and I’ll be back with a conclusion. For now, be sure that someday, somewhere in Spain, Forrest Gump will be brought up in some conversation that I’ll be part of. Somehow, I will come up with his running pace, and you may rest assured that I’ll be quoting your wisdom. Also, gracias for the upvotes and the awards :) Salud.

**Edit 2:** This investigation turned out to be deeper than I had expected. I am very glad to see that, even when we don't ignore the fact that Forrest Gump is a fictional character and his adventures are dramatizations, this idea of a man (or a woman, doesn't matter) finding a sudden and sincere evasion to so many things by just waking up and running, resonates among many people in this forum. Personally, I find it strangely familiar and attractive, even when I have not tried (yet) to make a 'Forrest' myself. Although I din't explicit so, this post was not meant to judge, evaluate or label Forrest's technique, or even the feasibility of the story, and you did not emit a judgement :) 
  
Now, the numbers (I use both international system and imperial units for non-US/US). Very early on, @Sloe_Burn provided a celebrated answer: measuring the actual dimensions of the Stone Bridge, estimating a pace of 6:04/mi (3:46/km). This is fast! @Mike1767 also did a pretty good, graphical work, deriving something closer to 8:03/mi (4:59/km), however I think there may need perspective-correction, yielding a little bit longer distance (and therefore faster pace). There is this [website](https://www.sceen-it.com/movie/133/Forrest-Gump), which is a database of films locations, that helped me to complement @Sloe_Burn research. I tried to find out the bridge shown in 02:12 among those in Yemassee and Beaufort (South Carolina, main location of many scenes), without luck. The velocity in that scene looks a pretty good indicator of his pace. Perhaps it would yield something similar to @Sloe_Burn's figure. Like @herlzvohg, I think Tom Hanks looks pretty running-fit in these shots. He was around his mid-thirties, and his strides were vigorous and well-cadenced (@mbeemsterboer -- the kick return scene is not him running, but his brother).

Forrest's pace obviously had to adjust to the new conditions, which included mileage, weather and... company. Take a look at 5:19. We haven't measured any pace there, but it is evident that the rythm was slower (here it pretty much is my experience, or intuition talking). Look at those people following his trails, most of them, however young, with probably little-to-no training. Let's not forget that the story arguably tells us about the emergence to the [running boom of the 1970s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_boom_of_the_1970s), triggered, of course, by our main man, Forrest.

Summarizing, looks like Forrest had two ""gears"": the solo-running pace, and the groupie-running pace. The former could easily settle *below* 6:27/mi (4:00/km), which is not slow, by any means. The later was certainly *above* 8:52/mi (5:30/km), a realistic number in the context of a 3-plus-year jogging. Maybe it was just him politely waiting for his buddies to catch up. Or maybe it was just him enjoying the [summer breeze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQQbjpomexo), with so much mileage already put on his feet. With no rushes, no clocks, no time to be home.

852,1653508626.0,I ran my first sub 1:30 HM! A little speedwork here and there actually does go a long way.,"Proud to say that a huge goal of mine I set to accomplish before turning 30 has come true (very early).  I ran a 1:29:33 HM this past Saturday!  I’ve been running since I was 12, and am 24 now.  

For a long time I could never discipline myself to do speedwork regularly.  I love pure endurance running where I’m not gasping for air, and never really enjoyed 5Ks and below.  But recently I realized adding in a 5K time trial once or twice a week really helps increase spm and muscle memory/turnover that is absolutely needed to go faster.  

I get criticism for this habit, but my mileage is very heavy for a 10K to HM kind of guy.  I do a lot of double days, typically running 120-170 km per week.  Before I started running 5Ks regularly about two months ago, my HM was roughly 1:38-1:39 (hadn’t changed at all over 8 years, with a 1:38:57 at age 16).  I noticed I didn’t feel fully gassed after running that in several instances.  

My breathing and HR always felt fine running high 1:30s / low 1:40s, but my legs simply didn’t turnover fast enough for me to go faster.  Getting into shorter, faster distances helped me unearth hidden “speed endurance” I didn’t realize I had in me.  I managed to shave ~10 minutes off my HM just by getting into speedwork a little.  Albeit, a lot of the work was already there for aerobic capacity — I just needed workout variety basically.

Bottom line, if you’re struggling to shave time off longer distances for months/years and don’t do much speedwork, add some in!  Even if it’s just once a week or so, it does actually help.  Stay positive!",running

Despite taking Winter months off, I stuck around and am in Spring training now.  I went from not being able to run a 5k at the start of the pandemic to doing 5k+ almost daily, completing a half marathon training plan and got my pace / mile down to 8:30-9:00 on relatively easy runs. Not saying this is stellar progress or that I'm any kind of elite athlete, I still have a ways to go. Just saying that I've had real measurable gains. Running is now part of my life in a great way. It is something I do for fun and a great supplement to my lifting routine. 

I noticed when I started at the beginning of the pandemic the sub seemed to have a lot more activity and now it feels like maybe half as much, but it could just be me. Anyone else recognize this? Could it be that when gyms reopened we lost a lot of our runners?

But when COVID hit, I lost my job, stayed in my house, and didn't move for about six months. I tore through all my expensive running leggings with chub-rub. :(

865,1486036812.0,Two things that made my running so much better.,"For a very long time I would get winded at a mile and a half and have to walk. It was discouraging and sometimes embarrassing. 

My birthday came around and I got new running shoes - Asics. I immediately loved them, but the problem still occurred. Finally I realized I needed to slow my pace. I went from an 8:45 minute mile to 9:45 and everything changed. On Jan. 3rd I easily ran a 5k in 30:33. As the month went on - in my new shoes and slower pace - I was running four miles, five miles, and just recently 6.2. Just yesterday I ran a 5k in 27:13. 

I just wanted to share what a difference it made to slow my pace and to have proper gear. I love running so much now since I can enjoy it at my own speed. This Sunday I plan on running 7 miles and cannot wait. Thank you r/running for the constant posts of motivation and ambition!",running
866,1620522282.0,Do I need a weapon to feel safe on runs?,"I am out of ideas.  I feel SO unsafe on my runs.   Since Covid, I have been staying with my parents in rural Massachusetts.  There are lots of trees, no sidewalks and few people out and about.  I am 30 something female and am constantly being harassed in various ways on my runs by men in trucks and dogs.  It's not constant, but it happens regularly enough that I've become jumpy any time anything unusual happens.  (Some poor family stops to ask for directions, and I become terrified.)  Its very rural around here, so there is literally no one to hear my screams. 

Cars, but mainly pickup trucks, are banging u-turns so that that they can leer at me and scream sexually explicit things at me.  There are no sidewalks around  here.  Trucks literally love pretending they want to hit me, and swerve aside at the last minute. Apparently attempted homicide is super fun!

Today, I was on a relatively new route today (expanded for distance), and on my way back I encountered a loose, highly aggressive dog.  He was running in and out if his front yard and onto the street.  I couldn't get by him, so I backed slowly away, rounded the corner where he couldn't see me and then ran a quarter mile in the opposite direction.  My husband came to pick me up.

This is a constant problem around here as no one has real fences, and you just have to hope the dog is housed by an electric fence or that the unleashed, unfenced dog is friendly.

I'm just feeling so demoralized. Other runners (esp women), what do you do?   Do you just brave through it?  Is there a solution?  Pepper gel makes me nervous, but have people had success with this?  (I'm worried it will blow back into my face and dehabilitate me.)  I do run on quieter roads, but that is because the cars travelling on them traveling at lower speeds.

I just want to cry, and am truthfully thinking of quitting.  I already bought a smart watch so my husband can track me.  And just as a note, I'm no shirking violet.  I've been living (and running) in NYC for the last 10 years.  I've had more terrifying encounters in the last 1.5 years in rural USA than in the last 10 years in NYC.  Any helpful suggestions or commiseration appreciated.

Edit:  Wow! thanks for all the support and suggestions.  Ive been lurking for a while and this is my first post ever.  It really made me feel better.  I'm going to try running with a go pro in a highly visible place and a can of pepper gel.  I'm also going to get a few practice cans so that in the event I need to use it, I know how.  Hopefully the camera may be noticed and guys will be deterred from bothering me.  Hopefully, I will not ever need to use the pepper gel, but if I do I will also have evidenced that I was in danger and not just a lunatic with a can of mace.  (Also I'm going to start calling in the trucks who try to hit me to the police.)

As to moving to a safer place, quite frankly, I'm bothered by men no matter where I live.  The difference between here and NYC is that there are people around who can help me, and the scary men are typically, but not always, pedestrians.  It's much scarier to be menaced by a guy in a truck while you are all alone, than a guy on the street when there are tons of people around.  It's not a rural or American problem either.  I grew up in Boston, and spent my earlier 20s living abroad.  I have been stalked, groped, cat called and followed in NYC, Boston, Paris, France, Manchester, UK and Tokyo, Japan.  The only place I've ever lived where I was left alone was Seoul, South Korea, and its possible its because I was obviously a foreigner.  I can't speak to the experiences of Korean women. Admittedly, I have not lived in any of these places for quite some time, so hopefully they have improved.  

I will say every time I've asked for help from a passerby or store owner, they have always stepped in.  Sometimes people have stepped in without being asked.  As I said, I really appreciate the support from reddit and those strangers!",running

871,1593255989.0,Slowing down... A personal perspective.,"As many of you will know very well, a lot of new runners and certainly many new to this sub seem to be asking a lot of questions to which the answer is simply ""slow down"". I thought I might take some time out to lay out a purely anecdotal account of my past few months of running which outlines the rationale behind the slowing down mentality and how it actually provides a great framework for achieving your running goals.

So a little background to start off. My strava yearly totals since 2014 have never broken 200km. I have always been running, but sometimes on a sort of two weeks on six months off sort of relationship. As with many runners, I started out nearly entirely focused on my time. I would run my short 3km route and I would blast myself round it until my lungs felt acidic and my legs felt like they were numb and each week (for the 2-6 week period i'd manage to stay running that is) i'd do it time and time again in search of half a seconds increase because the only rule I had set myself was that I would always beat my own time. Mentally throughout this period my thoughts constantly revolved around my supposed inability to run much further. I was able to run a 5k after a little more build up but seeing that time per km drop just wasn't something I enjoyed seeing. I knew I couldn't keep up my pace indefinitely but that didn't mean I had to like seeing it. 

So this went on for pretty much the entire 2014-2019 period until this year. So about 5 months ago I was about to start off my next bout of running. I decided however, that I wasn't all that motivated for it and mentally I just didn't have the strength to push hard and get those valuable seconds I craved. So I didn't. I went out and I ran at a pace that had me querying whether or not I should even bother running at all. But low and behold, upon my return I felt like a sprightly young deer. My legs were pretty fresh despite running my normal routes so over the weeks I decided to experiment with this new pace to see what I could manage exactly. Unbeknown to me, this was to become the start of my longest running  streak both time and distance wise. Ever since slowing down and failing to care about my time per km or even overall time, I've managed to progress from a constant 3-5km to doing somewhere between 8-12 during the week and a half marathon distance for my weekend long runs. I have never felt better about running, I have never enjoyed it more, I have never felt healthier and had a better relationship with food, I have never felt this sort of mental clarity before. This is what running is supposed to be. 

PRs are amazing achievements no matter where you fall on the timescale but chasing them endlessly isn't reasonable. It isn't sustainable. I'm at the stage now where I can healthily balance my distance and times and I certainly see a little of my old PR chasing past coming in to push me for faster times but it's a healthy level of competition I have now. I understand pacing, I know that I can't keep my 3km pace for my half marathon and I'm perfectly ok with that. So  for your own sake people, slow down and enjoy your run.

TL;DR

Slowing down benefits everyone both physically and mentally. Try it once in a while.",running
872,1565207814.0,Stop worrying about the numbers and just run!,"I think I've had a bit of a breakthrough, and wanted to share.  Lately I've noticed that I am constantly worrying about my pace, mileage, heart rate, and other metrics.  The amount of data I was trying to juggle centered on my runs was mind boggling.  I've noticed that happens to a lot of people around here too.  

* ""How many miles do I need to do X?""  
* ""What will my marathon pace be if I train at Y?""
* ""It was a billion degrees out, and I couldn't stay in Zone 2, now what?""
* ""I'm not running conversationally at Z pace, but I *really* want to BQ!""

You get the picture.  It's stupid, and it sucks the life out of running.

Well, the other day I needed a mix up in my training for my upcoming marathon beyond my normal out and back routes, so I decided to run from my house to my brother-in-law's place 18 miles away through the country on gravel roads.  I forgot my watch, but by the time I realized it I was too far out to turn around, so I just went with it.  I knew what time it was when I left, and could work back into a pace if I wanted to later...but, the funny thing was I didn't really care to. 

Then the really funny thing happened, I had fun!  Just running.  Me and the road, one step after another.  It was great!  It made me remember why I took up running in the first place.  I ended up running around 22 miles I think because it was just fun to go.  I felt like I was flying.

My training since has been refreshed, and I finally feel like I'm back on track.  I still have my goals for this fall, and have worn my watch for subsequent runs, but I'm having fun again.

So, if you are in the middle of rut, or are stuck on the numbers, take my advice: leave your watch at home, lace up your shoes, and just go run.  You'll thank me when you're done.",running
873,1625341821.0,An amateur's advice: don't overthink it,"I enjoy reading peoples' posts here, as well as the comments and advice that folks give and get. But it's interesting for me to see so much focus on hard days vs. easy days, up tempo and down tempo runs, and so-on ... when I just like to run.

I'm currently working to get my distances up to 20K, not because I want to run a *formal* half marathon, but because I just want to be able to run 20K a couple of times a week. (Truthfully, folks, I don't think I'll ever run in a formal race - it just doesn't interest me.) I don't worry about my running times, or the level of effort I put in on a daily basis. I run as hard as I feel like. If I'm feeling low-energy (likely brought on by our old friends Mr. Sun and Ms. Humidity), I run slower. If I'm feeling good, I run faster. That's pretty much it.

What's interesting to me is that when I started running again, back in Dec of 2019, as a 265 pound dude who stands 5'11, my running times were abysmal. Not even worth looking at. I was running at an 8'50""/KM clip. 

As I've gotten my weight down and have extended my distances, my time has gotten a lot better. My average time for April of this past year was 6'20""/KM, at a time when I was starting to run distances of 6, 7, or 8KM (I averaged 5.70KM/run that month). In May, that time dropped to 6'03"", despite the fact that my average run increased to 6.82KM/run. In June, heat and humidity reduced my overall distance a bit, but my time dropped to 5'55""/KM. 

In consideration of up-tempo, down-tempo, fast, slow, etc. etc. runs, I ran my longest distance ever on the 1st of this month - 13 kilometres. Despite the fact that I hadn't run even 10K in about a week and a half, and my legs were tired by the end, my pace for the run was 6'03""KM. And when I ran 5K the next day, on what should've been a ""recovery day,"" I ran it in 5'36""/KM, which is on pace with some of my best times in the last few months.

I just run for the sake of running. I love the meditative aspect, as well for the improved health benefits, and I enjoy the challenge of pushing myself to run more and farther. I'm hoping by the end of the month to be running 15K every once in a while, and if I can hit 15K, I see no reason why I can't be running 20K on weekends in September just for the hell of it.

I appreciate all the thought folks put into their routines, and into improving their times/distances. But all I know is, I never even look at my watch when I'm running, I frequently can't tell if I'm having a slow day or a ""fast"" one, and from the start of this year to now alone, I've increased my average runs from 4.18KM in January (at a 6'33""/KM pace) to around 6.5KM in May/June at a pace that's more than 30 seconds faster per kilometre. I think just putting in the work will give you gains, and sweating the small stuff just makes running a little more like work than pleasure. 

I do expect to be royally downvoted for saying so, though. I know how seriously you all take your routines. But for the casual runner out there, like me, I just hope you know that you don't need to overthink it in order to improve as a runner and enjoy the experience.",running

881,1635169254.0,One year of running - my achievements and a few tips for other overweight new runners,"12 months ago I was very overweight, and also a heavy smoker for 20 years. Any physical activity was a struggle.

I decided to take up running. 

It was very hard at first. But I stuck with it. And kept sticking with it all year even through some tough periods.

I’m still overweight and a relative beginner at running so I won’t give any advice. Just a few little tips for very overweight people that I wish I’d known at the start to make me more comfortable.

- Try not to wear baggy cotton tshirts. I had many of these as a big fat guy and so would wear them running for the first few months. The problem is they get soaked in sweat and stick to you and also chafe your nipples. Believe me this ain’t no joke. You can go to new dimensions of pain. I switched to cheap synthetic running shirts and it’s much better.

- Tank tops are hit and miss for me. With some I find my chunky arms will rub against the armpit fabric and get sore.

- If you do get the nipple chafing, I have found bandaids or thin sports tape the best for me.

- Wear Lycra shorts underneath your running shorts. Trust me, it’s so much better. It’s a miracle how it totally stops thigh chafing.

- Don’t be shy to wear a headband. As an overweight person I sweat a lot and it can really help keep sweat out of my eyes on a hot day.

- Run short and slow. Just keep doing it. Run a mile. Wait a day or two til your legs stop hurting. Then do it again. Just a mile. You’ll work the rest out later, just keep coming to this r/running sub. People are kind and very helpful here.

- I know it’s easy to feel embarrassed but you need to embrace the true spirit of ‘fuck it’ and just do it anyway. People care much less than you think.

- Good Bluetooth earphones and audiobooks are a very important part of my routine. I’ve been on many runs just cause I wanted to know what happened next in my book!

Here’s my stats if you’re interested. They are nothing to boast about but I owe a lot of the motivation and knowledge to r/running so thought I’d share.

I've been at it for 3 months now and steadily improving, I am running 4 times per week mainly for enjoyment and my general health (trying to lose weight). 

I took 1h 17m for it (6:15/km) which at least for me is a good pace, and I almost felt like I still have energy in me. I usually do a long run on the weekends, but usually I keep them around 10 km, and 6 under the week. I am in great shape, and I don't really have people to share with right now, so I thought I just scream it into the world.

&#x200B;

I hope everyone does as good as they can and want to, have a wonderful week!

Edit: I had some questions on my training plan. Currently I’m doing 2 ‚easy‘ runs (6 km slow pace), 1 6 km fast pace, and one long run at a slow pace on the weekends. Is that generally a good place to start?",running

886,1596927111.0,"As a mild asthmatic, I can now say breathing is no longer my “limiting factor”","When I began consistently running at the end of March I’d struggle to run 1.5 miles at tempo pace without wheezing and I’d have to slow down or stop. Fast forward 4 months and no matter what pace or distance I seem to run, it’s always muscle fatigue that limits me and not my breathing. I wouldn’t say a half-marathon at tempo pace is easy for me now, but it’s definitely doable.

I hope this reassures new runners who are struggling with breathing that a variety of aerobic and anaerobic training can go a long way in improving your performance and making your runs a lot more enjoyable (runner’s high is a lot easier to achieve when your breathing isn’t too laboured). I’ve found that increasing my aerobic capacity through running has not only improved my sports performance but has also improved my day-to-day breathing and overall quality of live, so keep at it!",running

894,1606008892.0,Ran my first sub-2 hour half marathon on my 2nd time running this distance.,"**My Journey (27M)**

Around this time last year, I was in a bad place after my ex broke up with me. I had to work on myself and found running as an outlet and thankfully I did. I am so happy that I was able to get into running!

I remember going to planet fitness and signing up for a membership after Thanksgiving week last year. I started a C25K training on a treadmill but did not really take it seriously. However, I was still able to finally run a full 5k around March of this year with a time of around 27 minutes. At this time, the gyms started closing and I had to run outdoors (thankfully). I also learned about weekly mileage and started incorporating that in my runs. I remember running around 12 -15 miles on a weekly basis until the last week of July when I decided to run the half marathon in my city. 

**Half Marathon Training.** 

I started a 12-week Half Marathon training from July to September of this year and was able to run my first ever Half Marathon virtually at 2:08:39 with 9:47/mile pace (Nike Zoom Pegasus 36). I remember bawling after realizing that I just ran 13.1 miles. Emotions started coming after I started looking back on where I was and where I am at that moment. 

Ever since my first Half Marathon back in September, I maintained a steady weekly mileage of about 22-24 miles. I also incorporated speed training on Mondays on top of my regular strength training and long/easy runs. 

**I broke my first Half Marathon Time.**

Today, I ran my second half marathon in under 2 hours with a time of 1:59:49 on a 9:08/mile pace (Nike Zoom Fly 3). I can't believe I was able to cut down my previous half marathon time by almost 9 minutes. I was also able to run this distance with a lower heart rate and a much more progressive pace! I feel so accomplished and I can't be any happier!! Thanks to this subreddit, I have learned a lot about running. 

**PRs:**

5K: 23:46

10k: 54:38

15k: 1:22:48

Half - 1:59:39

896,1626395442.0,I Ran My First Half Marathon!,"Hi everyone!

I'm really excited to report that I've successfully ran and finished my first half marathon! Before I get down to explaining my training regimen, check out my previous post, titled [""I Ran a 5K for 32 Consecutive Days.""](https://old.reddit.com/r/running/comments/nmzsc5/i_ran_a_5k_for_32_consecutive_days/) This will give you a better idea of my running history. 

**TLDR of the hyperlinked previous post:** I turned 32 back in April (where I got the 32 consecutive days from). Prior to turning 32, I ran on and off, but was mostly in a slump, so I challenged myself to get out of that rut and focus on getting back into running. Needless to say, I got out of that rut and continued to run consistently. 

Now, for those interested, I'll break down my training regimen that got myself to a point where I successfully ran and finished a half marathon without stopping! 

**The month of June:** My ""5k for 32 consecutive days personal challenge"" finished May 27th. I decided to rest the remaining days of May and wanted to undertake another challenge in June. That challenge would be to run a 10k every day in June. As you can see from the [spreadsheet,](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTp05Mr-uuFvydzB3fFMsTQKFkACsGDC7dWTs2yYw6jJ0TYLkb6cf9n6klEXo9_px5YsbsUpvXyfdaQ/pubhtml) I started June off by running a 10k for the first 4 days. I tried to keep this going on the 5th day, but unfortunately the humidity and the heat got to me and I couldn't get to 6.2 miles and just ran 4.06 miles on the 5th day. You'll notice, if you check out the spreadsheet, there are a few days where I didn't even run at all! I live in New England and the humidity and the heat to start off June was quite overbearing. Moving forward, keeping the humidity in mind, and knowing that I fell short of my 10k every day challenge, I decided to add walking to my runs and just work towards getting myself ready for a half marathon. (Sorry if I shouldn't even talk about my walks, knowing that this is a running subreddit. But it was an integral part of my training). **All in all, I ran a total of 97.35 miles and walked a total of 51.71 miles in June.**

**The half marathon:** I had set in my mind that I would run the half marathon sometime mid July, but I didn't have a specific date for it just yet. So I took the same approach I had in June (mix of runs and walks), and applied it towards July as well. The day (7/13) I ran the half marathon, I actually **had no idea** I was going to run a half marathon. What started off as a 5k, maybe a 10k at most, ended up being a half marathon! The weather was perfect. My run felt great to start it off. I ran the 5k, the 10k, approached mile 8, then 10, and in my mind, I told myself I'm going to run a half marathon. I'm pretty sure I experienced a runner's high for the first time and it honestly felt great! I got to mile 10 and I told myself that I am a simple 5k away from reaching a half marathon. Well... it wasn't simple... It got really difficult the last 1-2 miles, but I pushed ahead and finished my run and successfully, for the first ever in my life, finished a half marathon! 

**Reflection:** I couldn't be happier and more proud of myself for this accomplishment. When I first started running (back in October of 2020), I couldn't even run a mile without feeling like my heart was about to explode. The purpose of this post is to truly inspire others. I shit you not, my fellow runners...I couldn't even run a mile without having the need to stop before I got into running. If you're a lurker on here and want to get into running, **please do not be discouraged from your runs when you first start out.** Just keep at it and listen to your body when you need a rest. You will achieve whatever running goal you have for yourself as well!

**Here is a [picture of my half marathon route](https://imgur.com/syruGQz)** I crossed out some of the street names and what not to stay anonymous. This also shows my stats for the half marathon run.

**Tips from me:** 
* I would highly recommend adding walks to your running routine (if you have the time). I like that it keeps me active on days when I don't or can't run and it also serves as an active recovery. 

* This is something that just works for me, but honestly a solid 5-10 min of butt kicks and knee highs after a long run feels great. I don't feel as sore. 

* Try to switch up your terrain (obviously if you can). I live in a hilly area, so running up and down hills is a great way to challenge my body mid runs. It also helps with shin splits (in my case, that is). 

* Walk if needed (mid runs). Look, I know it sucks when you're running and you get tired or get a cramp, and have to stop. It's okay. Just walk it out and finish your run strong. Don't feel too bad about it. 

**Looking ahead:** Well, my goal is now to run a marathon. For this, I actually want to sign up for a race and not just do my own route. I think running alongside others would push me to run better and benefit my mindset during the run. There is a marathon race lined up in October by where I live, but I don't know if that's enough time. I think moving forward, I'm going to research about marathon training programs and follow that. If anyone has any recommendations, feel free to share!

I love this subreddit. It's one of my favorites. I enjoy the support most people receive and the constructive criticism as well. Looking forward to reading up on others' personal achievement and sharing my future accomplishments! 

Hope you enjoy the read. Take care, everyone!",running

898,1598495212.0,First time in my life I actually had to use pepper spray,"I've carried pepper spray with me for many years because there are coyotes in the open space area where I run from time to time. Today as I was running towards the open space on a paved street, two medium sized dogs (not pit bulls) escaped from a house about 100 yards away and started chasing me. I heard their owner yelling for them. I initially thought to start sprinting away but decided to stop and turn towards them and wait to see if they stopped. But they didn't and when one of them was about 3 feet away I pepper sprayed it. It whimpered away but the other dog behind it kept coming. It also eventually stopped and turned around without having to use it a second time.

Once it was over I continued running without talking to the owner. Do I need to report this to the police? I don't know which house it escaped from. I'm in CA where small size canister is permitted for self defense. In the future should I try to outrun it if it's not a big dog?

**Update #1**

I called the police to report this incident, and the dispatcher took down my name and number and said they will check to see whether they can find out if the dogs are ok and call back if necessary. My initial impression is they were more concerned about the dogs' well being than my own because I used pepper spray.


**Update #2**

The police apparently called animal services and gave them the details because I got a voicemail from animal services saying I need to provide an exact address (which I don't know) or they can't do anything. I called animal services back and they confirmed if this happens again there's no reason to call them to report this because nothing can be done.

So I guess the only reason would be to call police just to record the incident. They really didn't care at all either. So I'm inclined not to call at all in the future. Lesson learned.",running
899,1582168608.0,A shout out to the pacers at the Austin Marathon!,"My daughter and I ran the Austin Marathon this past weekend and had a blast. We had run Marine Corps together several years ago, but my daugher stepped in a pothole during the race and was unable to complete her goal of running a marathon in under four hours.  This fall she suggested we try again, and we chose Austin - not because it's a fast course, which it's not - but because we wanted to spend time in Austin. Neverthless, she wanted to break four hours and we trainined accordingly. She completed a half-marathon in late November in 1:40:01 so I was confident she had the speed. After doing our long runs together, I was also confident she had put in the necessary miles. But to increase our chances of success, we decided to run with the 3:55 pace group led by Meredith Terranova and RuthAnn Lobos, both very experienced runners and pacers.

The race began 40 minutes late, but RuthAnn and Meredith kept everyone's spirits up as we waited for the race to begin.  The first few miles were crowded, as both marathon and half-marathon runners worked to find their pace.  Meredith and RuthAnn did a great job of leading us through the crowds and keeping us on target. Once the crowds thinned it became much easier to run as a group, and the miles clicked by as Meredith and RuthAnn kept us right on pace.  Although it was humid, and hilly, we made it to mile 20 without too much difficulty.  We had focused on hydration and nutrition throughout the race, and we were feeling better than expected as we started the last 6 miles.  By mile 23, however, the hills and humidity were catching up to us, and our pacers kept us engaged in conversation over the last few miles to keep our minds off of our growing fatigue.  As we approached the final hill leading to the finish, our spirits were high because we knew we were going to beat 4 hours with time to spare. As we approached the finish line, RuthAnn handed my daugher the pace stick to carry across the line in celebration.  My daughter was over the moon when we finished in under 3:55.

I've run many marathons, and this was the most fun I've ever had. Helping my daughter achieve her goal was much more rewarding than achieving my own PRs. Could we have done it without pacers?  Probably not. They kept us on a very steady pace, and really helped us get through the hardest miles at the end.  By not focusing on pace, I was able to ensure we stayed focused on nutrition and hydration.

I would definitely run Austin again. It's just the right size, at least to me. Big enough to feel like a big race, but small enough that you're not running with 30,000+ other runners.  The course is challenging, but you get to see a lot of the city, which we enjoyed. On top of that, you get to spend time in Austin. We had some great meals before and after the race, including barbecue from Franklins.  Not a bad way to spend the weekend.",running

now, i have an arcteryx aptin zip and some long sleeve capilene so i'm not totally unprepared but my legs. MAH LAIGS. so i decided to read up a bit on what most folks use and i found that most guys tend to just go in shorts or loose fitting jogger-style pants. im not down with flippy-floppy gear when i'm running so i eventually turned toward fleece lined tights

they seemed to work pretty well but i was worried about the wicking capability of fleece. so instead, my eyes settled on the new balance impact run tights

-side pocket for phone? check  
-zip pocket for cards/keys? check  
-no silly mesh liner to abrade and chafe? check  

that brings me to today. as i pulled my new tights over my legs i felt a supreme sense of empowerment. i was taking sexy back from the ladies on a run, and today was my debut

i didn't think to realize i mainly run in a 55+ area and in the woods where no one sees me. the appreciative glances and looks i *did* get were appreciated but best reserved for someone 20-25 years my elder. alas, my spearhead championing of returning the sexy run back to the dudes probably failed, but my legs were supremely warm and comfortable. sometime around 7km i realized that the compression was helping out a lot, too. my legs never really felt tired like they do in the cold normally

The wait before the race began was difficult because it was much colder than I had prepared for. But once it began, it was glorious. I was so cold that I couldn't feel anything, so I was fully immersed in my sight & sound which almost felt otherworldly.

I managed to finish in 33:14 without stopping, which was a huge accomplishment for me!

903,1566866668.0,"Run like you’re married to it, through the good and bad.","I’d been feeling low about my running for almost a month. Not putting up the miles as I slowly recovered from a torn ligament. The intense summer heat wasn’t helping matters, either. 

But I still made my quota in prep for my first Half coming up at the end of next month. 

Problem was, I was phoning it in. Going through the motions, forcing myself to enjoy myself. Had this hobby run its course? Was I done with the feeling of elation, satisfaction, and pride that I felt after banging out a good run?

Lowest of the low: two weeks ago. I went out for my Sunday long run. Nothing crazy - 8 miles to get the hip back up to snuff. 

Weather was beautiful, not too hot, and I was on my way. But I didn’t want to be there. I didn’t see my 8 miles as a dragon to slay at the end of a journey - I saw it as homework.  Sure, my hip hurt a little, but it was an undeniable feeling of ‘meh’ that really had me shaken and scared I had lost the love. I turned around and walked home after two miles. Touchy and grumpy... embarrassed and low. 

Took a few days off to ‘rest up’. Ran one more quick run before a 5K last weekend in Charlottesville, VA. 

I wasn’t even that excited about the race until I laced up that morning. Got my gear on before the sun came out - drove fast the 65 miles to get there with enough time to stretch. The air was cool and my friends were waiting. 

When the race began, I took off. I didn’t think about my hip, or my Half, or my days off or my half-ass runs I was phoning in. I was breathing full and steady, keeping my pace and loving every minute of it. 

I ended up PR’ing my 5K without even making that my goal. I came home with a recharged battery - a new wellspring of vigor and enthusiasm. I’m going to crush my first Half next month. I’m going to be thankful my hip is healing and that I’m willing and physically able to run. 

Ran again as a shake off today with a good, strong pace and time. 

I’m still new to this marriage, but I want to believe that we made it through the first of what I can see will be many ups and downs of this love of Running.

### Pre-race
Well at the ripe age of 19 I decided I was ready for my first marathon. All the races near me looked pretty boring so I thought one in the mighty land of North Korea might be a laugh. Luckily this trip lined up perfectly with my university Easter break so I thought fuck it and signed up! After ignoring my family and friends advice of: ""don't go you imbecile"" (something about nuclear war or something??) I was off to Beijing as the direct flight from London was full. On a side note, really wasn't a fan of Beijing, felt like everyone there was trying to rip me off or scam me as a pale tourist. Luckily I did meet one friendly Chinese guy who took me to a teahouse there and I ended up paying ~$60 for some watery tea and snacks!

After my fun experiences with the Beijing locals it was time for my pre tour briefing! You have to go on a tour to get in to North Korea - I went with Koryo Tours and would highly recommend. The briefing consisted of important rules such as a newspaper folding procedure so you do not fold or crease the great leader Kim Jong Un's ugly mug.

With my newspaper folding skills tremendously improved, the next day we were off to North Korea! We took the internationally renowned Koryo Air, which was by far the strangest airline I have ever flown with. The air hostesses looked scared at the sight of foreigners, but were all very helpful and the service was great. Not sure what meat was in the on-flight meal but it stayed down so I can't complain.

Those of you that have seen documentaries about North Korea or have read about it's... quirkiness, will know what I mean when I say THIS IS THE STRANGEST PLACE ON EARTH. Oh my days words cannot describe how incredibly odd everything there is. You walk off the plane and there seems to be a member of staff for every person on board.

Everything is immaculate and fancy, not what I was expecting for a nation with a food crisis. The pictures of the two previous great leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il stood on the wall in every. single. room. The tour was only 3 nights so we spent the next 2 days driving around monuments and seeing the sights while listening to our three Korean tour guides lick the Great Comrade Supreme Leader's arse and feed us the most pompous propaganda I have ever heard. We were told about the good that they had all done for the country but I can't say many of my fellow tourists believed this either.

Pyongyang is a very strange city as there are nearly no cars, but 8 lane highways are common, there are people but they have no cafes, bars, and very few shops to go to. People just seem to... walk? Those of you that have been will know what I mean, people never appear from or go in to any buildings. I really felt like I was in the Truman show. The roads are lined with colourful buildings but just behind them you can see the derelict apartments where most of the general public actually live.

I was looking forward to the marathon as it would give me a chance to see parts of Pyongyang that aren't 'for tourists' and maybe give me half an insight as to what life in North Korea is really like.

### Training
Training went relatively well, I didn't follow a strict plan or any plan at all to be honest. I would usually wake up and see how much I could be arsed to run that day and would just do that. I didn't record my runs whatsoever I just know how far the routes I run are.

My bread and butter of this training camp was doing doubles with other sports so I was exercising for at least 2 hours a day, 6 days a week This was great for endurance but I found my legs were not as strong as I would like. A normal week of training would consist of three 1 or 1.5 hour hour boxing sessions followed by a 4-8 mile run. Then I would play  80 mins of football (soccer) twice a week with 6-12 milers after football. And then maybe a long run on the weekend if I wasn't hungover from the night before. But I found consistency and running nearly every day worked better than doing longer but fewer runs.

Unfortunately I was struck down with a virus 4 weeks before the race so over the last 4 weeks leading up to the marathon I put up less than 15 miles. I had the option to run the half instead but I'm only gonna have the chance to finish the Pyongyang marathon once so I stuck with it.

### Race Strategy
The race started and finished in the Kim Il Sung stadium (surprising name!!!) but the stadium would close after for finishers over 4:30 and another finish line was organised for those within the 5 hour cutoff. With this in mind I simply wanted to finish in front of the 80,000 captive North Koreans that filled the stadium, so I aimed for about 4 hours but didn't want to push myself too hard as my travel insurance didn't cover the marathon. Although Kim Jong Un is an incredible surgeon and has undeniable healing powers I thought it wasn't worth testing the rest of the North Korean healthcare system.

### Pre-race 2
Up for breakfast at 5:30am with absolutely no clue what our supposedly 5 star hotel had in store for our important pre race meal. When I got down there I was greeted with a large buffet with many options. It turned out the 'mixed fruit juice' was just flat Coke, but apart from that I was pleased with the breakfast. As there was no peanut butter, bagels or bananas I settled for a load of southern fried chicken (bad idea but it was delicious), an omelette and some bread - pretty sure I read somewhere this is what Kipchoge also has before a race so I felt confident.

We took the tour bus to the stadium and we took part in the opening ceremony by walking around the track and lining up on the grass inside the track. After the foreigners lined up, the Koreans entered the stadium in military like formation. One thing I found very surprising was that there were kids as young as 8 running the half marathon in black leather suit shoes. They must have had a solid 4mm drop or something because those kids were absolutely rapid.

The start was a little disorganised but after about an hour of standing around the gun went and we were off!

### Miles [0] to [6]
Not much crowding whatsoever, feeling good and getting in to a good rhythm. Passing all of the crazy monuments and squares that would obviously feature on the Pyongyang marathon route. The course was an out and back alongside the river so after the 10k turnaround it got much quieter.

### Miles [6] to [13.1]
Just cruising at a relatively comfortable 3:40 pace. Pass the half turnaround and it gets very quiet, pass the hotel soon after and now I am finally leaving the centre of Pyongyang and getting out in to the sticks a little bit. At around mile 9 we get hit with a fierce headwind and no matter how hard I tried to slipstream off the 4ft Korean kid in front of me I was still getting pounded by the wind. After 4 miles of being pretty much alone and going in to a strong wind my legs were not in the shape I had hoped they would be at this point. Passed through the halfway turnaround in 1:50 and still feeling very good.

This stretch of the race was by far my favourite. Men, women and children lined the streets giving out high fives, smiling and waving. It was such a polar opposite feel to the center of Pyongyang where I felt the smiles were forced and the parks were empty. Out here people were playing basketball, volleyball, football and seemed to be generally enjoying life. This area was no way near as nice as the center but felt 100x more welcoming.

### Miles [13.1] to [20]
Not much happened in this section, I picked it up a little in order to make full use of the wind I now had pushing me from behind. Was on a solid 3:35 pace until mile 19 when I realised I may have pushed too hard in to that headwind earlier and my legs were seriously paying for my stupidity.

### Miles [20] to [26.2]
Craaaaammmppsss. Ouch. Never had such awful cramps in my life and my Clif Shot Bloks had less sodium in them than I expected. Had to walk most of the last three miles as I was feeling exhausted and very dizzy. Luckily I got to share a few miles with some nice people including a guy who is going to run a marathon in every country! Oh yeah and the hail that was now falling from the sky did not make this part any more fun.

To finish the race you do one lap around the track inside the stadium and the 80,000 people that were still sitting there gave me enough energy to hobble-run the last 400 metres, and just like that I was done in 4:00:50! - A whole 3 hours after Kim Jong Un completed the race!

### Post-race
After drinking some salty water I was on a mission to find some of Pyongyang's finest beer and some fried chicken in the tents outside the stadium. Found both which was a result. Spent the rest of the day eating and drinking until 1am when my body forced me to sleep. Woke up the next day at 6am for my flight, at which point I suddenly regretted all of the beer and mushroom soju I had drank the night before. Got back to Beijing in one piece and freedom felt amazing!

### What's next?
Already signed up for the next one in October, where I'm hoping to go a lot faster than 4 hours. Then after that I'm moving to ultras!

Some things he says:

* In running and in life, it’s important to grow slowly, to be patient, but above all be consistent in training!
* Dedicate yourself fully and be consistent.
* Finish the training when you still have a lot of energy to smile so you can recover well and come back the next day.
* Think outside of the possibilities of what people think is positive. It is important to believe that no human is limited. He says this all the time!
* Walk your talk, improvement goes hand in hand with dedication.
* You should have a pen and a diary so you know what you're doing. With that, it will turn you into a real serious runner because you know what you've been doing.",running
909,1594131217.0,Finally finished c25k!,"It’s been a bumpy road but I’ve officially finished Couch to 5k! Honestly couldn’t be happier with my progress, I have never been a runner at all so really didn’t believe I could do it! 

I tried it last year and couldn’t get past week 4 where you run 5 mins at once, so stopped. This year I restarted from the very beginning as something to do in lockdown. I didn’t manage it in the 9 designated weeks as I had a slip in the middle where I couldn’t hit the 28 min mark, but went back a few runs and got there eventually! I’m so happy I pushed through even despite the mini set back! I ran the 30 mins as scheduled to finish it off last week.

I run pretty slow though so running 30 min doesn’t cover 5k for me, so today, for my first run since officially finishing c25k, I decided to just run one and see what happened - and I managed it! It took me 38.5 mins, which I know is slow, but I made it! I thought it’d be a huge jump from 30mins to 5k but it really wasn’t as bad as I expected (hopefully I won’t be eating my words tomorrow in the aftermath). I’m so proud of myself for running a 5k, I really really really never thought I’d be able to. I’ve counted this completion of 5k as finishing the c25k experience, even though it didn’t fit into their time frame. Everyone’s running journey is different, and even though I didn’t manage a 5k in c25k’s time, it was a great way to train myself up to running it at my own pace!

I cannot recommend c25k enough, even if you have a blip don’t worry, pace yourself, go back a few weeks if you need to. Just keep pushing and DON’T GIVE UP!! Trust me, you’ll thank yourself.",running

# Background:

I was an overweight child, but by high school I had hit my full height of 5’9” (175cm), slimmed down to 130-135 pounds (\~60kg), and ran varsity track and cross country. I wasn’t competitive at a state level, but I had PR’s that I’d love to run again today: **4:45** (1600), **10:14** (3200), and **16:44** (5k).

# The sedentary years

After high school, I stopped running and slowly gained weight over time. I tried to get back into running a few times, even managing to run a half marathon in 2016 in **1:56**! I was very proud (and I had every right to be), but my bad habits continued and by 2017 my half marathon time had fallen by nearly 15 minutes and I could no longer run a 5k in under 25 minutes. Not only had I slowed down, but I had gone up to 197 pounds (89kg).

# (Re)learn to walk before you can run

I knew that I needed to do something different. So starting January 1st\* I decided to do **everything** different. My focus was simply to lose weight and be healthy (shout out to /r/loseit for great advice). In short: I ate better, gave up alcohol, started going to bed early, and started doing cardio 6 mornings a week. Running didn’t work for me because I wasn’t in shape to run the way I wanted to and the way I needed to run wasn’t fun. So instead I started doing /r/Insanity and pledged to wait to run again until I was ready. Getting through Insanity was hard for me, harder even than training for the marathon. When you’re out of shape and overweight, those 60 minute plyo workouts feel like they are killing you. But they aren’t, they’re making you a warrior.

\*It wasn’t really meant to be a new years resolution, it just happened to be the time of year that my epiphany hit and January 1st was my first day back home after traveling for the holidays.

# Back on the road

I assumed it would take me the full year to get to a place I was happy and fit enough to start running, and maybe another year to get to my goal weight. To my surprise, after 2 months of Insanity I was down 20 pounds! So starting in March I started running again and didn’t stop. Here’s a summary of my year in running:

* **January-February: 0 runs, 0 miles**. Just 60 days of Insanity.
* **March: 5 runs, 17 miles.** I mostly just continued with Insanity videos, but I swapped out a few days for some short runs to see how it felt. Much better than previous attempts to start running again.
* **April: 20 runs, 97 miles.** I dropped Insanity and started loosely following a Hal Higdon plan (base building: intermediate, I believe) averaging 4 runs per week. Importantly, **I kept my easy runs easy**, something I’ve always found very hard to do. It paid off, too, because my final run of the month was a 10k race which I ran in **42:53**! WOW! It was about 5 minutes faster than I had hoped for going into the race..
* **May: 23 runs, 94 miles.** I started the month continuing Higdon’s plan but soon switched over to following a base building plan from Pete Pfitzinger’s “Faster Road Racing” book, running 5 days a week. I had a new goal: beat High School /u/llewey in a 20k race. Back then I ran a 20k race but ended up walking the last few miles after straining my hip. I thought that if I could beat my injured “fast” self, then I would be set up for a successful fall. But to do that, I wanted a different plan. I really didn’t like that Higdon’s plans were in “minutes” instead of “miles”. Silly, I know. But it worked for me
* **June: 18 runs, 103 miles.** Hey! My first 100+ mile month! And it started off right away with the 20k race. My [race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/8o917s/race_report_dam_to_dam_20k_classic_iowa_weather/) has more details, but I ran **1:28:47**, crushing my 20k PR by more than 6 minutes. The rest of the month was just a consistent continuation of my base building plan working up to 30 miles per week. And around this time I also hit my goal weight: **142 pounds (65kg)**, a total of 55 pounds lost.
* **July: 23 runs, 147 miles.** Midway through the month I ran a Park Run (first 5k of the year!) and surprised myself with a time of 20:00! And around then is when I transitioned out of the base building plan into the Pfitzinger 18/55 Half Marathon plan from “Faster Road Racing” with my eyes set on running a Half Marathon in September.
* **August: 25 runs, 183 miles.** Continued with the plan and ran my second 5k of the year in **18:00**. This was a fun one because it was a huge relay race. Instead of a normal race which thins out as you go, this stays crowded the entire time because of the waves of runners. It makes it hard to navigate but it keeps the adrenaline at full throttle.
* **September: 22 runs, 158 miles.** Lower mileage due to a taper and post race recovery, but I absolutely destroyed my goals for the half marathon, running it in **1:24:08**. As soon as I got home I immediately signed up for a full marathon in November with the goal of running under 3:05:00 and getting a BQ on my first attempt (even though I knew the course wasn’t certified and wouldn’t count anyway. It’s the principle, right?). Then they changed the qualifying times...o well.
* **October: 20 runs, 183 miles.** I was signed up for the marathon, now I had to train for it. That meant combining everything I’d learned from the last several months to put together a short bridge plan to quickly build my long run up. Fortunately my consistency throughout the year allowed me to do that without injury and I successfully completed 3 runs above 18 miles.
* **November: 14 runs, 98 miles.** The marathon was the first Sunday of the month and damn was it hard. I now know why Denmark is so flat: The forest that hosted this marathon stole all the hills. But all my hard work paid off and I ran **3:01:20** and a BQ\* (but not really) in my marathon debut! I took my recovery easy at first, but was a bit too aggressive by the end of the month and a too-hard long run on Thanksgiving morning pushed me over the edge and I ended up injuring my left foot.
* **December: 15 runs, 52 miles**. I took a week off, my first week off all year, before trying to run again. Turns out, my foot only hurts if I run two days in a row so I started alternating running with elliptical workouts and so far so good.

**Total: 185 runs, 1075 miles**

\*Of course, it isn’t actually a BQ because they changed the qualifying times, but if the race had been run **a month earlier** on a certified course it would have counted! Even if it was too slow to make the cut off.

# The keys to my success

* Consistency: I averaged working out (cardio or running or lifting weights) 5-6 days a week for the whole year and only missed maybe 4 or 5 scheduled workouts the entire year. I’m fortunate enough to have that much time, but getting out consistently, rain or shine, was critical.
* Work Smart **and** Hard: A lot of my success this year is possible because of my background in running and at least some amount of natural talent. But it took hard work to bring that back. I lost weight and built cardio first which made it easier on my whole body when I finally started running again. And when I did start running, easy mileage for a few months was enough to bring my times down a lot. And in the meantime, reading Daniels' Running Formula and Pfitzinger’s books gave me a strong foundation on which to base my next stage of training. Specifically, it gave me good guidance for paces based on my current fitness which kept my easy days easy enough and kept me pushing hard on the hard days to help me reach a level of fitness that I never expected.
* Luck: I could have done everything right and still ended up sick or injured by pure bad luck. But fortunately I stayed healthy and my body reacted so well to the training. I was also “lucky” enough to have the time and resources to fully commit to my health and running.

# So what’s next?

Priority 1 is to get healthy. Without healthy feet, there is no running. When I can run 5 days a week again, I'll start training for my two most important races this year: the Copenhagen marathon in May (realistic goal: BQ) and the Berlin Marathon in September (super optimistic goal: 2:45). If I’m fortunate enough to stay healthy and I maintain my commitment and consistency, I think I have a shot at meeting those goals. But I’m realistic and know that they are very optimistic and I'll roll with whatever punches come my way.

# Thoughts?

I'm just a guy that got healthy this year sharing my personal experience. I don't think my path will work for **everyone**, but I hope parts of it can help **someone**.  But what are your thoughts? Do you have a similar story? Is there something here that you think can help you in 2019? Or do you think I did it all wrong?",running
914,1609789009.0,"One Year of running, a look back","I started last year not being able to complete a running mile. Last week I hit a sub 2 hour half marathon, and a 10 minute 1.5 mile time.

All of my running has been on a treadmill, so I am fully aware that my times are \* and not road times.

I'm thankful to this sub for the 10% advice. It has helped me say relatively injury free.

Things I have learned...

Injuries move up, so if your hip hurts, it might be your knee, or it might be your foot. I figured this out after a few months of pain down my left leg. In working with a PT coach at work, the favoring my left foot caused issues up my leg. I'm now using a lacrosse ball on the arches of my foot, and that seems to be helping (along with foam rolling and dynamic and static stretches.)

I never really had a training plan except to run every other day, and I'm sure this hurt me in the long run as far as distance and time goals, but that also made running about a lifestyle choice and not about a target. I run for health and fun, so I'll keep going, even after I run a ""real"" race.

Some days you have a full tank and some days you don't. Don't be discouraged if you hit a personal best one day, and the next you bonk. We're here for health and fun, if it stops being fun, you won't run, and won't get better.

There are no shortcuts in running, if you want to go the miles, you have to put in the miles.

I started with an every day run, and after a few months shifted to every other day, I'm pushing 40, so the rest days are nice, and this allowed me to increase distance on run days. This year I'm focusing on adding better strength training to build up speed and power.

By making running a priority, it reinforced better eating, and less drinking (beer, not water) which created a self reinforcing loop. Don't want to get crazy every day with junk food if I'm going to be running tomorrow, and if I'm eating salmon, I don't want to waste it by not running.

Oh, and drink more water.

&#x200B;

What helped me get after it every run day was stacking habits. I start with 2 cups of coffee, and then breakfast. After that there are some chores. Once things move from the coffee, it's time to run! This worked to get me to floss too!

The book Atomic Habits by James Clear, was immensely helpful for motivation. It's basic premise is that we stack little positive changes every day, and at the end of the year, we're running half marathons, or playing guitar, or learning another language. It goes specifically into making good habits easy (treadmill in front of the TV) and bad habits hard (delete reddit from phone) It talks about how the driver wants to turn the elephant and the way the driver can do that is with a plan. The driver can't turn the elephant if the elephant doesn't want to. In my case, this was to run every other day, even if it was just a short mile jog, no excuses (obviously injury is a valid reason to not run) I'm not a fan of ""self help"" books, but I'm a big fan of any book that breaks down our own desires, impulses and thought-reward cycle into a way of getting us where we want to be. The book goes into the cruel irony of a doughnut on the couch releases endorphins right now, but it takes 3 months of running to see any real improvement.

919,1622931775.0,Running with an eating disorder,"I am a 35 year old male. I really enjoy running. And I have an eating disorder. 

There. I said it. This is the first time I've fully acknowledged it although others around me probably realize it and have certainly began questioning. During the last 6 months I have gone from around 250 pounds (113kg) to 180 pounds  (82kg). 

I've really, really had a difficult time with depression and circumstances in my personal life which I will not go into here. However, suffice it to say I used running and controlling my eating as ways to control the uncertainty in my life and things for which I had no control. And it worked - for a few months at least it felt that way. I ran about 35 miles per week with 4-5 7-10 mile runs. I don't eat breakfast. I skipped lunch and would run in the late afternoon to avoid the hunger pangs which did a solid job suppressing appetite and would follow it up with a modest dinner of 700-800 calories. And would primarily only eat when I felt my body weakening and the options were to pass out or eat. When it was normally time to eat I would make sure I was ""away"" so people would just assume I was eating. I avoid breakfast. I hide when lunch comes because I don't want to eat.

All this was working, at least in my mind, until around a month ago when I went on anti-depressants which made me very fatigued but improved my mood. Specific to running, this pattern has just drained me. I use to hum on 8 or 10 mile runs and now, combined with the increasing heat in Arizona, is wilting me after just a few miles. 

I am not currently seeing a therapist but will be reaching out to one on Monday. I just wanted to reach out in the running community to hear of other's experiences with this? It seems a weird pairing with running, which naturally should increase appetite, and an eating disorder. Are there others out there?",running
920,1589883320.0,Breaking the sub 25 minuted 5km in style.,"I've been running for a few months now. I am in reasonable shape however, breaking the sub 25 minute 5k time seemed impossible to me.

However recently I've been focussing on increasing my tempo and I've been running shorter faster distances.

I tried breaking the sub 25 minute 5k a few times before. In my first attempt I started too fast and finished quite slowly which gave me a 27 minute final time. The second attempt I started a bit slower and finished quite fast but still too slow about 26:30.

Yesterday evening I decided I was going to get it. F\*ck being tired after a day of working. Let's go outside and race against myself.

I've never done one of these race reports and this isn't even a race. It's just me proving myself that I can do it.

&#x200B;

I started of at a 5 minute pace which is quite fast for me. However, after the first kilometer I felt I was going to slow so I decided to push a bit harder so I had some more margin left in the end. This tempo went great I passed almost everyone who was running at the time and thank you fellow runners for the motivation. Even though we are not racing, I always want to catch up with the person in front of me so this reasonably busy road was great motivation.

I felt quite good untill I reached 3,5km then my legs started to tire and my mind started to doubt if I could manage it.  I decided to just shift my thoughts on the next landmark and at least keep running untill it reached it. When I reached it I still felt tired but the next landmark was only a few hundred meters away. So I kept going and going.

At 4,8k I looked at my watch and saw the time and I felt that with a good end effort I could finish below 23:30 and I sprinted the final 200 meters.

&#x200B;

After 2 attempts I finally succesfully broke the 25 minute barrier fysically but above all mentally. I set a time of 23:26.76 and I am super happy with myself.

However, I do want to do it even faster. So I see you all at the sub 20 mark in a few months.

924,1541510600.0,[Race Report] My Wife and I Ran a Marathon 'Together' Without Realising It,"Youtube video of our race - https://youtu.be/AsNWkYK3wlg
Strava activity - https://www.strava.com/activities/1942504678

This past weekend was my wife and my favourite marathon, The Kaapsehoop Marathon. This race starts in a small village on top of a hill, always hidden in the mist, and runs down to Nelspruit in Mpumalanga, South Africa. We have run this race now for three years.

The goals for each of us were quite different. I was aiming for a comfortable 04:30, while she was hoping to crack her first sub five-hour marathon. Last year, she went under five, on her watch, but because she spent a good five minutes stopped to talk to friends on the side of the road and with auto-pause turned on her watch. She thought she came in at 04:58, but officially it was a 05:03.

Early, we set off in the mist. For the past two years that we’ve run this marathon, wild horses have galloped among us runners. Although this is quite beautiful, it’s hair raising too. This year we only saw the horses nonchalantly grazing at a distance. 

The course runs on a forestry plantation road for the first few kilometers and then turns around to join up with another road taking us to the finish at Kaapsehoop. Nearing the turn (at 5ish kilometers in), my wife was running just meters behind me. This made me quite concerned that she was going out way too hard. I was on pace for the 4:30, so she was already well under pace. 

And that was the last that I saw of her during this race.

The rest of the run was incredible. Mpumalanga, the province where the race is run, is one of the most beautiful in South Africa and each turn in the road reveals the most astounding landscapes. 

At halfway I was just under my expected pace, a 2:12, but I knew that there was a hill toward the end that I was planning on walking, so I still had the 4:30 under control. I remember thinking at that stage, my wife should be a little over ten minutes behind now.

She wasn’t

Although I think Kaapsehoop is my favourite marathon, it’s the hardest one that I run each year. The downhills make it quick, but it hurts my quads and I inevitable will hit the wall at some stage.

This year was different. I ran very easily until late in the race. My pace remained the same and I felt so confident that I actually stopped looking at my watch after a while. I did at one stage think about picking up the pace, but my legs gave a little squeal when I suggested it. So, I resumed with my regular pace.

A few times during the race, I was concerned for my wife. She has a habit of going out too hard, and when I saw her earlier she looked ‘too good’. 

The final hill starts at 39km in and my plan from the start was to walk the whole way. I knew that I would lose at least 3 minutes, but if I had enough time banked, this would be okay. 

The race finishes at Mbombela stadium, one of the stadiums that hosted the 2010 Soccer World cup. I walked a little to take photographs on the finish straight, and finished comfortably in 4:28.

I then walked slowly back along the course to watch my wife finish, when I heard one of our clubmates shouting, ‘Hey, did you see Charleen? She finished so strong!’. For a second I thought he must have it wrong, she’s never cracked 5 and the time now isn’t even 4:35. He insisted I should go look at the tent and promised that I would find her there.

So, there she was with a big smile on her face. She finished just under a minute behind me. Turns out, looking later at the Strava Flybys, that we ran the whole way together without even realising it. The furthest that we were apart was four minutes, and at times, the gap was down to 40 seconds. 
 
If I just ran a little slower in one section, or her a little quicker on another we would have been able to run together, but she assumed I was way ahead and I assumed she was well behind.

She beat her PB by over 34 minutes!

EDIT: Thanks everyone for all the support! This sub is just incredible and I love sharing our stories with everyone. I've been reading all the comments to my wife and she's very appreciative

I would not have believed that I could have  done it, were it not the fact that I distinctly remember how shit I felt on W1D1.

Nevertheless, this has been an accomplishment that I am proud of. And I'm looking for advice for the future now.

Before that, a few quick tips that helped me along the way in hopes that it helps others. 
1. Breathe! It's more important than you think. (Look into the wiki for more info)
2. Posture. Straight up and look forward with a slight tilt towards the front.
3. Foot/heel to hit the ground in line with your straight upper body. Not too forward, not too behind. 

This one is a personal preference: I hydrate using a bottle that has a straw. Which you use to suck in the water from.

Don't forget to read the wiki and the beginner post in this subreddit. All of it works.

Coming to my own questions
I ran for 30 minutes, following all the advice in the thread. (Be at a conversational pace etc). So I am not sure if I actually am able to run 5k as the distance. I haven't measured it as well, since I figured that just getting into the habit of running longer is more important at the time. 

My goal as always has been to improve endurance. (it helps in other sports too). Being a big guy, what should my next goal be? (Considering the effect it has on one's knees)

Should I practice running at same speed for longer periods?
Should I practice running for the same time at higher speeds?
Some form of HIIT?

Specific plans would be helpful as I found that having a plan like c25k helped a lot

I was running through my little town and  was approaching a crosswalk with a stop sign. I saw a car moving towards the stop sign about 1/3 of the block away. Plenty of time to cross as the car will have to slow for the stop sign. Since it was a ""T"" intersection, they weren't just blowing thru it.

As I entered the crosswalk, the vehicle didn't seem to be slowing as I expected, so I slowed and stopped halfway thru.

I was coming from her left and she was planning on turning left. She was looking right to see if anything was coming so she could just keep rolling thru the stop with a quick look to her left.

936,1593626338.0,Bit by a pitbull while running,"I was running at a trail and got bit by a pitbull that was off its leash and wanted to give some info on what I learned from the experience. 

I turned a corner on a trail and saw two pits with their owners. One immediately charged me and I kept it at distance with my forearm. The encounter was short, and luckily the dog was trying to scare me away from its owner rather than actually fully attacking me. It bit and scratched at my forearm, but never got to my face or body. The other pit got grabbed by its owner before it got to me.

The main mess up, I didn't think the dog bite actually broke skin, and continued my run without getting the owner's info. The adrenaline made me not feel a couple small cuts on my forearm. My doctor determined rabies risk was low since the cut was relatively superficial, the dog was not wild(with its owner), and the dog wasn't displaying rabies symptoms. However, if the cut was worse it would have been great to have the dogs immunization record. I did not need a rabies shot.

Second mess up, not up to date with my tetanus immunization. This isn't a huge problem, because I got the immunization directly after the incident, but as runners it is a great idea to have the shot up to date in case we get cut on a trail.

Third mess up, no plan for animal encounters while running. I felt entirely unprepared when the pitbull charged me. I had never even considered what I would do in the case of an animal attack and it lead me to stand my ground with no plan of what I was doing while one pitbull was charging me and another wasn't far behind. If the dogs really wanted to, I think I could have been badly injured or killed, but they luckily were only trying to scare me away from their owner. I am now mentally preparing to either climb a tree or flee in the case of a dog attack, and I am much more interested in planning for bear encounters because I do not want to act on instinct.

Some context: I ran cross country for four years. When I say ran, I mean I lived and breathed cross country. It was my entire personality. And the number one rule of the sport? No walking. Period. 

But now I'm a long time out of high school, and not a cross country runner. Back in the fall of 2019, I ran a half marathon without walking. When the pandemic hit, my gym closed down and I moved back home to a neighborhood I did not feel comfortable running around alone (I don't have running buddies). I lost all of my progress. For the last year or so I've been the most sedentary I've been in my entire life. All year I've been trying to get into running again but I find I run a mile and I'm burnt out and just want to quit. 

I don't know where my love for running went. 

But then in April I picked up c25k, thinking maybe if I slowly built my endurance up I'd get back into loving it again. And I did! I absolutely loved c25k and never missed a workout. However, after graduating and running the 3 miles without stopping I've fallen off the wagon again. I miss the intervals. Today I decided, screw it, I'm just going to start running with walking intervals if it means the difference between not running at all and having a consistent workout schedule. 

Yet that voice in the back of my mind creeps in and tells me I'm a failure, or I'm lazy, and that I'm just trying to make my workouts easier. It is so so toxic. I believe that if you run, you are a runner no matter if you walk or not. But I still find I am judging myself! It's so frustrating. I didn't know if I am alone in this feeling, or if others have similar experiences?",running
942,1578429420.0,Lets talk about running a marathon for the first time.,"Hello Running Friends! 

I wanted to talk a little about the marathon and/or the half-marathon that you want to run. Many runner here are experienced marathoners or distance runners and this may not apply to you. But a lot of newer runners have laced up their shoes fairly recently, and after a handful of runs, you might be thinking a marathon is in your future. So I thought I might offer some unsolicited guidance/advice for those that want to try this grand feet (<--- its a pun, get it) of endurance called a marathon in 5-9 months from now. So here goes.

1) First and foremost; It's ok to run, and enjoy running, without ever having to run a marathon or half marathon. You can run shorter races or no races at all and still call yourself a runner. Seriously though, you don't have to do anything you don't want to do running.  

2) The hardest step of any run, is the first step over the threshold of your door. So, don't delay, get yourself outside on a run. Once your running your living the dream! So have fun, wave at people and smile, pet random dogs your pass, take selfies with the sunset/sunrise, jump over logs, run with friends, run in the snow, or do whatever you want, but keep doing it while running and try to enjoy the suck. 

3) If you're just getting started, remember to take it easy out there. It's ok to walk every once in a while during your run. I like to walk up steep hills when I feel like my heart is going to explode. I even walk in races sometimes if I feel like it. I've got a friend that carries a mandarin orange in races, and if he's tired, he sits down on the ground and eats his orange, then he gets back up and finishes the race. Nobody is going to judge you for walking, and if they are judging you, they're probably judging you from inside their car/house/bus/etc and they aren't running, so disregard their opinion. Running is for your self, and it's a state of mind, a state of being. So you do, and everything will be alright. 

4) Running is cumulative. Throw a quarter in a jar every other day and after a week you will barely have enough to buy a cheeseburger, but after a year of this you'd have enough to buy a nice steak dinner. After a week of running  your not going to see much progress, but after a year of running you'll be a different person. It all adds up over time. You're not going to a superstar right away, but stick with it and you'll feel like a million bucks before you know it. The key is to keep going out and running. 

5) You still think a marathon is good idea? Look wayyyyyyyy down the calendar for races that are far away.  A May marathon is only about 120 days away, and September marathon is only about 240 days away. That means if you run every other day from now until your race, you might only have 60 runs for a May race, or 120 runs for a September race. Think about your fitness right now, and would you be ready to run a marathon after 60 runs? How about after 120 runs? If in doubt, find a later race.  

6) Find a marathon plan, and kinda stick to it. There are a tonn of plans out there. If this is your first race your probably want to do the easiest plan. And unless your pretty damn good, don't even think about qualifying for Boston on your first marathon. Your goal for the first marathon should be A) not get injured in training so that you can start the race and B) to finish the race. Some people stress over every detail of a training plan, but I think it's ok to lightly follow a training plan.  It's not gonna kill you if you miss a day, cut a run short, or go long on a run. Just try to do your best to stick to the plan and make your runs count by doing quality workouts. 

7) Take care of your body. If you get injured on your training you might not be able to run your race. That's just the facts, and it sucks, but that's how it goes. So if your training and something doesn't feel ok, go get it checked out and/or take some time off to see if it gets better. It's better to kill a little training time then really hurt yourself and be out for months. Injury stops a lot of people for completing their races, so seriously, listen to what your body is saying to you. 

8) I'll rehash this point again.... Getting ready for a long race like a marathon takes a lot of time and consistency. So start working now for a race that you want to run in the fall. Start building your capabilities now, so that you will gradually increase your abilities which will decrease your chance of injury from overwork. 

9) Did I mention that you should be having fun? Because you should be totally enjoying yourself running. Yeah, it's gonna suck sometimes, but it's also awesome. So enjoy yourself, make some friends, and love each other; because we all need some love. 

I'm sure I left out a lot of good ideas or tips. Feel free to add your own tips or motivation to the comments.

Without fail, at least every few times I run, I get some type of harassment, usually in the form of honking but I've had it range to more obvious catcalling like people slowing down to say random things like 'ayy girl', to a guy once sticking his neck far out of a passenger window to scream at me ""nice tits!"" (<-- and that time I was with my boyfriend, and wearing a huge baggy hoodie!)

Today I was going for my long and slow run of the week, ~11 miles.

I thought ""that guy must be lost"" and I don't think I would have noticed if he didn't have a sort-of unique looking car. At this point I was running on a major road very near to my school. 

Finally, I notice this same green car turn right into a plaza just south of my University. I almost knew at this point that he was going to try something because after three times pulling into places I didn't think this time was a coincidence or simply being lost, so I kind of held back and didn't cross the main entrance. Lo and behold, I saw him pull back out and kind of stop at the median where I would have crossed the entrance of the plaza. He opened his car door and set his foot down and said ""Hey, do you think I can run with you tomorrow? I would really like to run with you""  I said ""No! I don't run with strangers sorry!"" To which he replied ""yeah but I really wana run with you"" and I said ""Yeah NO I'm sorry""

I look down at my phone and realize that I had NOT been recording the encounter as I'd thought, because I'm a dumb newbie iPhone user, but I quickly managed to snap a pic of the rear of his car + his license plate.

The beginning of the park trail passes by some playgrounds/pavilions/exercise equipment and is fairly flat and open. Then there's about a quarter mile that goes through more dense trees that overhang the trail before opening up again as it approaches a neighborhood. 

I'm hitting the start of the section with the overhanging trees and I'm feeling pretty good. I've been trying to focus more lately on having a lower average heart rate during my runs, so I'm keeping an easy pace and sitting comfortably around 130-140 bpm (this will be relevant in a second). 

Suddenly I notice a shape in my peripheral vision, moving swiftly but silently about two feet to my right and a foot overhead. As it flares its wings to brake and perch in a tree ahead of me, I realize it's a barred owl. ""Super cool,"" I think, and continue on past the branch it was sitting on.

Almost immediately after passing the tree, I felt a pat on my head. It didn't hurt at all, I would liken it to the feeling of getting tapped while playing duck-duck-goose as a kid or something. Obviously it was a bit of a shock though, and I'm not too proud to admit that feeling something bump me on the head while running through dense, low-hanging branches in the dark freaked me out a bit. Then I saw the dangling legs of the owl pass overhead before it landed in another tree in front of me. After I got home, I checked my heart rate stats and at the moment the owl hit me there was a huge spike up to 200 bpm. I did my best to make some noise and wave my arms around to deter any further antagonization from my feathered friend, and finished up the rest of my run unmolested. Although I never was able to get my heart rate all the way back down for the rest of the run.

Has anyone else had an animal encounter while out for a run? Really interested to see if somebody here has had a similar experience with an owl.",running
948,1533848539.0,My proudest moment as a runner,"When I was a freshman in high school, we had the best runner in the region on my team. He got sixth at state and won the NXR Midwest region. Everyone knew he was amazing, including me, this tiny, puny freshman. You could say I saw him as a god haha. One meet, we happened to be in the same race - someone had gotten hurt forcing me to run on the varsity team. Right after the call out and right before the gun, he turned around and gave me a fist bump, saying “good luck.” Oh. My. God. He gave me a fist bump. He paid attention to me. That was one of the happiest moments of that freshman year for me, even though he has probably forgotten the whole thing! 

Fast forward to my senior year, and I was nowhere near as good as he is. But I was a senior, and all seniors are seen as “above” by the freshmen. I went up to one of the slower freshmen on the team before a workout, and did a similar thing that was done to me 3 years before - *fist bump* “go get em today!” and throughout the entire workout, in the heat and sweat, he was smiling. You could just see a glow in his face that was new. And he killed that workout like it was nothing also. 

Point of the story is to say, especially to those of higher status on school teams, you have a bigger impact than you know! You have the opportunity to change an entire kid’s outlook on this beautiful pain ridden sport we call running. Being someone’s inspiration to continue and endure and learn can make everything worth it. You can be the spark! 

Happy running :) 🏃🏻‍♂️",running
949,1583205676.0,I just PR'd on a 5k my first race of that distance in several years. My first few races I ever did we're 5k distance when I was trying to get the hang of running without stopping so I was lucky to average a 10 minute mile. I just did my 5k in 22:34,"So I'm really proud of my time. I'm 36 years old. I won my age group but got 6th for the women overall. I was struggling through what felt like an incoming shin splint and an echo of the asthma I haven't felt since I was a teen during swim practice. I've been training with a group of women who do all kinds of running workouts, but are usually prepping for half marathon and marathon races so I don't get a lot of speed work in. I held on to second place for the first mile until I decided to back off so i'd still be able to maintain a run rather than dropping down too a walk. And then a much older woman passed me. So I guess my question is how is 5k training different from half? What should I be doing differently? Is there something I can do to prep to reduce that feeling in my shins? Maybe (which I'm not great at) and as far as the breathing, it was colder than I would have liked which I know didn't help the situation and I wasn't prepared for. Anyone have tricks for that? It's like to keep improving this distance and maybe the 10k too. Tips for speed work? Thanks guys!",running
950,1570738032.0,you're stressed for race day? remember nothing will matter once you start running,"I just ran my first marathon. I read every single thread in this feed, I read books, I read Runners World and Outside Magazine. I talked about the race. I asked for advice from peers. I went to physical therapy. I  did everything I could to **control the race.**

And guess what? The gun went off and I had forgotten my nuun tablets, I ended up spitting out gels at mile 18, I drank some Gatorade on the race which I never do, I didn't have to go to the bathroom half way through like I thought I would. None of it mattered. In that moment I realized I had just been stressing myself out over something that honestly is just a fun accomplishment and a nice way to spend a Sunday morning.

So maybe that can motivate you to stop worrying about every single little gel or mile mark you're making or not making and just remember to prepare & treat your body well, and run. Now that I know what I know, I'm not going to worry so much about every little aspect of running. I'm just going to run. (and deal with the tendonitis in my foot...)",running

### Training
23 years old, female. Height: 180cm (5'11). Weight: 70kg (154 lbs).

This is my first-ever full marathon! 

I started running in April 2022 for managing stress. Completed 10k in June 2022, 15k in August 2022, and 20k in September 2022. I ran a half marathon in October 2022 and finished at 2:01. I've been busy with graduate school and stuff after that. 

I moved to the US across the globe about two months ago and signed up for Tobacco Road in January. I've not been training very regularly before the race. The only long run I did was three weeks before the race: 32k (20 miles), finished at 3:27. My monthly running mileage was approximately 48k (30 miles) because I've been busy with transitions in life and school work. 

Tobacco Road would be my first marathon and all I wanted was to cross the finish line. I did not choose a specific diet during training, but I ate a lot of chicken breasts.

### Pre-race
Got up at 3:30 AM. Drank some almond milk. Ate a banana, some leftovers, and a muffin. Drove to Durham and took a shuttle bus to the race. Arrived at 5:27 AM. 

The weather was freezing cold. Contestants were waiting in a tent (which was also freezing cold). There were a lot of bathrooms. 

I waited until 6:50 AM, and contestants lined up at the starting line. There were approximately 2800 contestants in total. 

The race started at 7 AM sharp.

### Race
The weather was just above freezing when the race started, but it got warmer as time passed by. 

I followed the pacer for 4:20 for most of the race until the last three miles, when I couldn't keep up any longer (but I finished around 4:20 anyway). 

I didn't start to feel tired until I got to the half-marathon mark (13.1 miles). My left foot started to hurt at 15 miles, then my right foot started to hurt along with my left foot. My limbs (arms and legs) started to feel numb when I hit the 20-mile mark, but I could feel them again at mile 23 when I felt pain in my ankles and knees. That was when I couldn't keep up with the pacer, so I slowed down a little bit and kept running at a very slow pace. 

The road was flat most of the time. There was some incline during the last two miles but nothing too much. The trail was shaded.

There was a water station every two miles. Every water station had energy drinks and water. A few had energy gels, bananas, chocolate candies, and chips. Some even had beers :)

Especially appreciate the race environment! Love the people cheering for us along the way. Very motivational!

### Post-race
Still alive! 

Does anyone have tips for post-race recovery? I cannot bend my knees and my back hurts. I have to waddle around and I cannot climb stairs. I've been lying in bed after the race.

EDIT March 21, 2023: My legs are feeling a lot better! I still feel some pain walking down the stairs but I think I’ll be fine. Thanks for all the encouragement and tips! Love the running community 💗",running
953,1598281185.0,Please stay safe when social distancing yourself from other pedestrians,"This morning I witnessed a fellow runner attempt to social distance themselves around other sidewalk pedestrians by bolting into the bike lane very suddenly. They were running with the flow of traffic and were almost taken out by a bike as the cyclist approached them from behind. The runner had failed to look behind them prior to their action, and wearing earbuds, so they didn’t hear or see the cyclist approaching. 

I see this happen multiple times DAILY. I’ve also seen runners take up a bike lane while running while not being aware of their surroundings. This causes some interesting interactions when a bike lane is protected, and cyclists have no way to safely get around the oblivious runner.

TL;DR - PLEASE be aware of your surroundings. Run safe, run happy ✌🏽",running
954,1463691973.0,One of my students accused me of lying about my running career in front of my entire class today,"Backstory: I ran a lot in HS and still do today.  One of my 16 year old students is a terrific XC runner at my alma mater where I now teach.  One day he asked me what my fastest mile was in HS.  I told him I specifically remember the day I ran around a 4:40 something when my coach was timing us.

The kid comes up to me in front of my class on the last day of school today and calls me a liar.  Said he met my old coach and the guy said I never ran close to even a 6:30.  I didn't know what to say.  He continues to come up with lots of circumstantial ""proof"" that I am lying.  Says he can't find my mile splits online.  (I don't think we put any of that online in 2006?)  Anyway, he makes this serious sounding case, putting all sorts of burden of proof upon me.  I didn't really have anything to say other than ""that's just not true.""  

My whole class was pretty convinced I had lied to them.  

I found out later today that the kid is trying to break my time and it's been driving him insane.  I tried to reason with him that it wasn't even an ""official"" time so he should let it go.  He still called me a fraud.

## Training

Ok, I started training 5 months ago for the 3rd time. Every time before I would give up, get distracted / demotivated and never actually did anything. I started with a suuuper slow program, 20 weeks to a half-marathon, that included a combo of running and walking for starters. Training was hard, I don't think I worked out at all in the last few years besides hiking  / slow biking and ooooh it showed. When I finally started running without walking breaks my average pace for 9/minute, then 8 after \~2 months. Then in the last month leading up to the race, I took training more seriously, took a more advanced plan, started spinning for cross-training (LOVE IT + sped me up soooo much) and really started taking care about eating enough protein, eating for fuel etc. I cut over 60 seconds / kilometer from my average pace in 3 weeks. I was thrilled, I was excited, I was thriving, every run was better and faster than the last and everything was peeeerfect.

&#x200B;

8 days before the half-marathon, I'm supposed to get out and do my last long run and I realize my ankle hurts so I postpone it for tomorrow. By tomorrow, BOTH of my ankles are sprained, hurting and my world slowly collapses. I see a doctor who tells me not to run for 15 days, even walking hurts and the pain just gets worse. Then, 1 day before the half-marathon, my dad tells me to do some exercises to see if my ankles still hurt, I do them and voila - they don't and I should be ready to go. So I decide to give it a try because not getting out to run made me feel sooooo depressed, I was soooo looking forward to this date.

## Pre-race

Ooof. Overwhelmed, sad and happy at the same time, I'm almost certain I won't finish it but I just couldn't give up. I eat yogurt, oats & peanut-butter, my go-to pre-run meal, walk my dog, go to the starting place and of course everyone looks readier, fitter, happier, smarter, stronger, omg. But all I feel like doing is crying YAY. I do some warming up, looking what the people who actually know what they're doing are doing and decide last minute to ditch my water bottle and only rely on the provided one as it's too bulky to carry.

## Race

Well the water thing was a mistake because I'm sooo thirsty the first 5k, full-on feeling dehydrated + a strange cough every few seconds as if I'm at that moment smoking a pack of cigarettes YAY. My shoulder hurts, that's new. My headphones are falling off, everything sucks I can't believe I'm going to give up at what - the first 2 kilometers??? Every moment until 10k was painful, annoying, ughghhhhhh omg just thinking of messages I'll have to send everyone, how I gave up and not even because of my ankles, I gave up because I can't even run 5k? Well, then I got some water and some gatorade on the way, broke up a nice sweat and somehow started enjoying it. All the way. From around the 10k point on I knew I would finish, definitely thinking I'm somewhere in the 3h+ range because it felt so easy. And I didn't check my pace at all because it just stresses me out and I can't actually do anything about it. Anyway, 10k+ everything was a-ok, still painful, I still cried 4 times (happy tears), legs still felt like shit after 16k but I FELT GREAT. And I did it, I fucking did it. People who cheer for runners are the fucking best, thank you, I love you. And other runners who smile at you and check if you're ok are also the best.

## Post-race

Stretched, cried again and took some ibuprofen and I'm as good as new!!! Walked my dog again and I feel like a million dollars and the world is amazing and my friends just invited me to their wedding and this is the best day ever. I'm so slow but I don't care, I'll get there <3

Bottom line is Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate and take it slower than normal. PRs generally are not set in the summer months. 

Other highlights: 

- Make sure you dress appropriately

- Make sure you know your shade on your routes.

- Be cautious when coming back in from the heat (don't bash your head like /u/yourshoesuntied 

- Wear sunscreen if running during daylight. 

- Generally just be smart. 

- Hydrate again. ",running
958,1650619626.0,I (a beginner runner) ran for 100 days and here's what I learnt,"I recently decided to run for a 100 days in a row. Here's a few things I learnt. I know there are a lot of people starting out here and thought it might be good to provide some of my experiences for if someone wanted to build in a new healthy habit or was struggling with motivation. 

Of course, before starting like this consider what you need, talk to a doctor. It doesn't have to be running can be powerwalking or whatever you need to start you off. I'm not an expert just a man who did a thing and bloody loved it!

***Why? Just Why?***

I started out wanting to do RED January. It's the second year I've done it, and last year it just fizzled out. And I didn't run after mid-February. 

Why run everyday? I wanted to challenge myself and push myself to keep going. I'm very much a start/stop type of person. I was massively out of shape, put on loads of weight during the pandemic, and want to show myself that I could do it. The core was building a healthy habit so that I could but on it in the future. I wanted to feel better! 

After the 31 days of January, I set the challenge to get to 50 days, then 75, and finally 100. I'm still going (missed one day because I was travelling all day) and today will be run number 111 of the year! The current goal is to get to July 2nd of the 183rd day of the year. Halfway! 

The rules were simple: in January I had to run 5km everyday. I started running 10 minutes, then 5 minutes walking, 5 minutes running, until I was at my goal. Everyday I added 1 minute of running to the start until I ran the full 5km. Then the goal was to get under 30 minutes. That took about 25 days. From then it was just get out everyday, if I felt like doing 5km I did (and this happened most days) apart from a Sunday where I ran 5 minutes longer each week until I was at 10km.

I didn't warm up (bad I know) but always started slowly for the first 10 minutes to give my body a chance to wake up and find my stride. I did always cooldown and did some stretches. 

***Some stats***

* Total runs: 100 in 100 days
* Total distance: 474 kilometers (294 miles)
* Total time: 50 hours 11 minutes
* Furthest distance: 10.26 kilometers (20th March) 
* Fastest 5km: 27:15 (19th March)
* Fastest 10km (10th April, DAY 100!)
* Largest elevation: 58 meters (20th March...flat country)
* Fastest average pace: 5:27 min/km (19th March) 
* No. of injuries: zero

***So, what did I learn?***

Many of these things will be self-explanatory for those who have ran for years. But these are my biggest takeaways. 

&#x200B;

* **MOST IMPORTANT: Listen to your body:** your body knows when it's enough. I wasn't competing with anything apart from my own head. If you want to take it a slower pace that's okay. Your body will let you know what it needs. Listening to it will keep you from getting injured. Need to walk for a minute? DO IT! You can focus on endurance when your basic fitness is improved. 
* **I am able to create healthy habits:** I've never been a natural runner (asthma, weight etc) and now I can't start or finish my day without a run. It's part of my routine. As I said above, I missed a run this week for a number of reasons (mostly 10 hours driving from the UK to the Netherlands) and I missed it (but I did two runs yesterday to make up for it). 
* **Everyone can be a runner:** don't compare yourself to anyone else. You're on your own journey and you're doing it! And it feels amazing (even when those really healthy looking people overtake you!)
* **Not to push myself beyond my limits:** if it feels good. It feels good. This was about habit and slow change. I didn't want to injure myself and not be able to reach my goal. With rest days between this is different. But this wasn't about breaking records. 
* **Be kind to yourself:** having a bad day? It's okay. Get your shoes on and go. If it doesn't work out, then you've tried. 
* **Have a plan and then don't think about it:** Make a plan and then just get up and go. The days when I put off going out were the hardest. Going in the morning (and I'm terrible at waking up) meant that I didn't have time to think of excuses or stress about what happened that day. I now run on the evenings too, but I needed to have the intrinsic motivation to go from creating the habit. 
* **The first three weeks are the hardest:** your baby is adapting. And that's okay. It means you'll be sore, notice parts of your body you never think about. Embrace is and enjoy it. This was the period where I spent everyday building up. 
* **Stick to the same route:** this might be controversial. But heat me out. If you're like me and you're in your head too much, find a route that you can do. Especiially if you know it's going to be a hard one. Choose one that has even tracks and you can ideally do out and back to stay on the same side of the road (our pavements are ever so slightly slanted for water. This means that running with the road always on the same side puts pressure on certain muscles and one leg more than another. Fine for short runs but not when you do the route 100 times). Once that route becomes 'easy' and you're not counting the meters until the end, mix it up. I worked backwards and made the end new before mixing it up everyday. Now I just run wherever I want. Without stressing about how far I still have to go!
* **The right pair of shoes makes all the difference:** self-explanatory. But true. Find some good shoes (and clothes generally...thigh chaffing was a major problem because I invested in some proper boxer shorts). And proper socks! GET PROPER MOISTURE WICKING SOCKS! 
* **Your bowels will do whatever the hell they want:** there are a few very short runs in my runkeeper. And that's okay. I got up and went and had no control. 

***Would I do it again?***

I'm still going. So yes. Would I recommend doing it? It worked for me, but maybe I was lucky to stay injury free. Maybe I pushed myself too hard at times but I tried to be as sensible as possible. Maybe a 31 day goal works for others. But if you start and it's part of your routine, you'll eventually forget about the day number and focus on doing what you need to do. 

I feel amazing and healthy. I'm 33 (M) and 181cm/6ft taal. I mentioned my weight above as a reason, and I'm not where I want to be, but I'm closer. I started at somewhere between 105kg and 110kg (231lb-242lb...I was too scared to get on the scale. Last time I weight myself I was 105kg, but that was a while ago and believe I put on weight in the meantime). I'm currently at 92kg (202lb). So have lost somewhere between 13kg and 18kg since January 1st. Which is great, but wasn't the goal itself. 

*What's next?*

As I said, I'm still going. I'm currently doing a 14 week half marathon programme. That means on day 200 I'll be doing 21km. Still 7 days a week. The days that I'm not training I'm doing gentle 3km runs, just to keep myself moving.  Once that's done I think I'll move to a programme to get to 10km under 55min (maybe 50min). 

I was back visiting my parents in England last weekend and did a 10km run. I live in the famously flat Netherlands. Running 10km in 22 degree heat with hills was tough. But it's shown me the importance of mixing up my terrain. I'm going to head into the dunes more often.

I'll start a little bit of history of my running progression for context. So I've started running maybe two years ago in the running group that we have at work. It's weekly interval running group so all I was doing is that and a little bit of treadmill by myself which obviously is not the best way to train but in my mind it was better than no running. I kinda injured my right knee by doing this in the first year (it was already a bit weak from a snowboard injury). At that time I was proud when I could finish a 25 minutes 5K.

I came back 6 months after and did the same thing for a year, only ran with the group because I had no motivation to run by myself and this time it went way better. Maybe because I was cross training with climbing and core training. I had two clear goals in mind: I wanted to run a sub20 5K and a half marathon with no specific time at that time. Just the idea of finishing it was already big in my head. But even with the cross training, I still injured the inside of my left ankle. Again, it was an injury that started with another sport, badminton, and that I made worse with running. I couldn't run more than 5K in a row with having strong pain on the inside of my ankle so intervals were okay but no long distance and I was almost ready to throw away the half marathon dream. That was around october 2019.

Now with this quarantine thing since I had way more time for myself I took the opportunity to do some research and educate myself a lot more on how to train and how to run properly. In my running group we are lucky to have a Physio that run with us and give us advice so I had already a pretty good idea on the proper technique for running but I was most of time given advice in small bits instead of actually looking at the whole process ( this helped me so much: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=andAaS6Lyc8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=andAaS6Lyc8) ). So after watching all that I had a lot of motivation and now I've increased my mileage from 10K a week progressively to around 33K now and I'm running 5 times a week and running has never been so much fun :)

Having a plan with various types of training (tempo run, hills, long runs but also intervals etc), going out without knowing how long I want to run, being able to run continuously without big pain made this sport much more interesting for me. I didn't reach my sub20 5K yet but I ran the last 5K of that 10K in 20:35 so I'm thinking that I might try to go all out in the 5K in two weeks.

Thanks for reading, hope I didn't bore you and I hope you guys are going to reach your goals as well!

^(And sorry if I made mistakes. English is not my first language.)

PS: Now I updated my half marathon goal and I want to do it in less than 1h30!

966,1557794925.0,I ran for 20 minutes today: a word to those struggling with injuries at the moment,"I ran for 20 minutes today.

Around 1.5 months ago I had a long run of 15km. This was my last run until today as shortly after that I had a stupid bike accident that left me with a torn ACL and a whole load of frustration. I remember I've been training hard. I was looking forward to running my first half this summer. And I had to say goodbye to all of these amazing plans. When I stood up right after that fall and felt my knee buckle, my first thought was about that half. 

Not gonna lie, I was devastated at first, I felt like I went from being an active, energetic person to a zero in a matter of seconds. Forget 15km long runs, I could barely walk to the bathroom now. Heel slides and leg raises instead of speed work. Walking on crutches to a grocery store instead of running all the way to another neighborhood in the morning. It sucked bad. But I tried to find at least a bit of old feeling of accomplishment in these things. 

And it worked! Bending my leg a bit further, raising my calf a bit higher each day. Ditching crutches, walking first 10k steps. Squatting for the first time, doing my first lunge. Going to the gym for the first time, using the stationary bike, weighed squats. Feeling my injured knee becoming stronger and stronger. Stepping on a treadmill for the first time. And, finally, this solid 20-minute jog today!

I still have a whole road of recovery ahead. I still get tired and sad and frustrated. I will be having surgery in the future, and I'm not sure when I'll run my first half. But I know it's going to happen because I'll just keep grinding, day after day, gym session after gym session. If any of you guys are currently struggling with an injury, I feel you, and I wish you strength and courage.",running

For starters, this was supposed to be a nice tempo run for sure. I decided to do it around 8pm last night. I texted the RD who's a friend and he encouraged me to come out. I said what the hell and did it. I had to leave my house at 4:30 am because it was 100 miles away and started at 7. My goal was just to do what the Jack Daniel's formula calls ""marathon pace"" for me (even though there's no way in hell I can hold it for a marathon). So head to the start and that's when shit get's real really quick. 

I started the race and quickly realized it was going to be a nice training effort day as no one seemed to be around me and then all of a sudden, woman and dog! She must've went like 5:35 for the first mile compared to my 5:55. She gapped me upwards of 65s at the largest point of her lead around 6-7 miles. I averaged 5:53 over the first 7 and 5:44 over the final 6 to catch her. The pain was so damn real.

I finally got her around like 12.2 and we were side by side until like 12.9 when I finally broke away. 

I ended up running 76:04 and she ran 76:06. My goal today was to run around 77:30 but that went to hell in a handbasket when she turned the heat up to 100. 

Was one of the most humbling experiences of my life to watch a young woman and her dog just absolutely crush it for 13.1 miles. Kicker, she's only been running like 3 years. Double kicker, it was the first time I threw up at a race finish in AGES. I forgot what that felt like. 

Crazy talented. I'm going to reach out to her, if she's not shooting for the next trials she's insane.

so, i have two questions.  1.  when people ask me, do i tell them i'm a jogger or a runner?  i've read that the consensus is that under 6 mph is a jogger, and over 6 mph is a runner.  well i did that today, but it wasn't for a long duration.  so am i a long-distance jogger/ short-distance runner?

I asked if that was her bus and she said, ""No."" She said her bus stop was on the next street up.

When we turned the corner we could see that there was still a crowd at her bus stop. We slowed down and she caught her breath. I passed her back her things and wished her a good day at school.

981,1593932293.0,Unpopular opinion: I hate out-and-backs,"I've been running for about four years now, and taking it seriously for just under one. In that time, I have covered a lot of miles in a lot of different ways. I have done routes, I have taken straight shots and then got a ride back to my starting point, and I have done out-and-backs. Out of the three, out-and-backs are hands-down the worst.

I don't understand how people can stand them. In my mind, when I turn around, I have to redo all of the work that I just did, and I am hit with a heavy sense of dread and a strong urge to stop and rest every time.  If I'm taking a route, I don't have to cover the same ground twice, so I can continue to eat miles without getting full. Also, you have to deal with re-accelerating if you don't have the luxury of taking a wide loop, and having that in the middle of my run is awful.

982,1589330226.0,My Journey To Better Running Form,"I've been a distance running athlete for a decade now. I ran Cross Country and was on the distance squad in Track throughout high school, ran recreationally in college, and more recently have found a love for the marathon. My first was the KC marathon, where I ran just over 4 hours. It wasn't my goal time, but I was proud of my effort regardless- and DAMN that course is hilly.

For nearly the last two years, since I ran in KC, I've had pretty severe, chronic shin problems. I have multiple theories as to why (shoe change, muscle weakness, diet, pace, age, etc), but my new physical therapist and I have narrowed it down to form + muscle weakness.

I was a notorious heel striker and over-strider. Evidence can bee seen here: [https://imgur.com/gallery/19a7NU1](https://imgur.com/gallery/19a7NU1). I can't say for certain, but I think I didn't have issues before because maybe my shoes were cushy and supportive enough for my legs to handle it? I ran in Adidas Energy Boost for *years*, but they don't make them anymore, so I don't now (I run in the Hoka One One Rincon and they are great). I also *hate* lifting, so I have rarely coupled my running with strength training since I graduated high school in 2014, which has absolutely contributed to important muscle weakness.

Like most runners, I loathed being unable to do what I loved. Running was my stress relief, my way to celebrate life events, and my way to eat and drink ***anything*** (within reason, of course)*.* Eventually, I got fed up with constantly not being able to run and found myself a physical therapist. We spent some time analyzing my form, gait, posture, and footstrike. I learned what I think I might have known for a while- That my form sucked. I got a lot of feedback and things to work on:

* Transition to a fore/mid-food strike. This was supposed to take the load off my shins and knee every time my foot hit the ground. It would also encourage my leg to hit the ground bent rather than straight, allowing for less destructive force distribution throughout my leg. It would also be more efficient.
* Land with my feet beneath my hips. This helps lower stride length and encourage fore/mid-foot strike.
* Shorten my stride. This also helps encourage fore/mid-foot strike as well as a higher cadence.
* Bring my cadence up. Quicker feet means lower impulse on your joints.

I also had hip strength issues. So we found workouts to improve that.

Throughout my form-changing journey I've observed a few things that I think might be useful for others going through this.

1. It felt *WEIRD*. But it should. I was literally re-learning how to run.
2. I had to focus **ALL** of my effort on my footstrike and where I landed. To the point that I almost hated running because of it. The intense focus seemed to suck all the joy out. All I was left with was new, frustrating pain and an uncomfortable gait.
3. I got tired very quickly on runs. Mentally and physically.
4. My Calves and Achilles Tendon were painfully sore. This likely happened because I was loading most of the impact onto those parts of my legs rather than my shins and knee. Previously, these muscles didn't have to work as hard. This went on for *weeks*\- almost to a point of concern, but eventually they got stronger. My Calves and Achilles essentially got used to the new foot-strike.
5. After 4 weeks (the equivalent of \~20 runs, 30 minutes or longer) I didn't have to think nearly as hard about how I landed. The new gait and running form became closer to muscle memory. Occasionally it breaks down on longer runs, but it's not hard to get back.
6. Sometimes, usually after long runs, those parts of my body will become sore again. I think this is normal, as the further distance I go, the further out of my comfort zone my muscles get.
7. Roughly 8-10 weeks into this change (now), the soreness has mostly transitioned to the outside of my legs (Soleus muscle). PT thinks it is related mostly to my hip weakness.
8. I need to stretch and roll these muscles much more now than I did before.
9. The balls of my feet are currently growing callouses.
10. **I don't have shin issues anymore.**

Now I'm to a point where I can ramp mileage back up. My confidence is back and I feel like a whole new runner.

And it feels *good*.

I'm curious, though, whether anyone else went through something similar if they worked to change their form? I'd love to hear about it!

983,1588167306.0,First month of consistent running completed during lockdown!,"Hey, r/running. I just wanted to share my story with you guys as I am coming to the end of my first solid month of consistent running. I started running when the gyms closed to help keep my mind/body active as I enjoy training and it keeps me sane. I have never been a fan of cardio-based training but I was heavily involved in weight lifting and bodybuilding for years. I went through a long period of using PEDs (which I regret now) which resulted in me carrying a lot of muscle mass and looking good on the outside but I was very unfit and undoubtedly did some damage internally.


I began with the Couch to 5K app and used that for 5 consecutive sessions. The first time I ran, I felt gassed out after 60 seconds but I think that was mainly because my pace was all over! Adjusting my pace helped me progress at a faster rate than C25K advised so I downloaded Nike Run Club and ran for 30 minutes daily. I stopped/walked to catch my breath when I needed to but once I found my 'forever pace', I was able to run consistently for 30 minutes. I eventually started to use guided runs to cover 5KM per session and I even managed to complete my first 10K run in week 3 - my time was awful but I didn't stop or walk once. I felt amazing afterwards. 


I am by no means built for running. I am short in stature and my feet are completely flat. As it stands, I am running 5KM 3+ times per week and doing one longer run of 8-10KM every Sunday. I am also trying to mix in some interval/fartlek guided runs on the Nike app periodically to help with strength and speed. My fastest 5KM run so far is 28:01 and I hope to eventually get this to sub 25 minutes. The first time I clocked over 5KM on the Nike app was almost 40 minutes so even 28 minutes feels good. I have no DOMS, pain or injuries after my sessions with my current training routine.


I feel the healthiest, lightest and the most agile I have felt since I can remember. It is liberating to be training in a way that benefits my health rather than solely for vanity. I get such a buzz from running and will most definitely continue this once the lockdown has ended and the gyms reopen. My plan is to run 3-4 times per week with some weight lifting and stretching sessions mixed in between.

I have racked up 109 KM of tracked runs in the Nike app this month with my average distance per session being 5.08KM.


I'm not massively experienced when it comes to running and how to train so I wanted to check with you guys, does my plan sound reasonable? 3-4 running sessions, a mixture of different distances and speeds and some strength/mobility work in between? Also, I am thinking of getting a fitness watch to help monitor my heart rate also - is there a particular model/brand you guys recommend?

Evidence seems pretty solid, and currently no statement from Kate. Most damning evidence is that the GPX from her files does not like up with the watch that the Strava post says it's from. What do you think? Will she be fired?

Edit/UPDATE 2nd Feb:

UPDATE:

The London marathon wasn't interested in her time as her run was unofficial anyway - so for all intents and purposes it's a made up time.

During the London Half however, she claims to have ""wet herself"" during the course, and ""when I rejoined the race, it is possible that I did so at the wrong point on the course"". 

This is a long-winded way of saying, yes she did cheat, and did not complete the entire course. Must've missed a significant few kilometres to drop her time by so much. Either that, or the need to urinate was holding her back by 1 minute/km. Likely story! Hopefully she is DQed by the officials in due course.

With winter just around the corner in the northern hemisphere, thought it would be a good time for a quick, basic overview and discussion of running through the winter.  

*Note: [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/weather#wiki_winter.2Fcold) the link for the cold weather info in our wiki.  If you happen to be in the Southern Hemisphere and entering the season of the big fiery death ball in the sky, [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/weather#wiki_summer.2Fheat) the link to the ""Running in the Heat"" section of the wiki which links to [the current Heat megathread.](https://old.reddit.com/r/running/comments/h9kyhs/its_that_awesome_time_of_year_for_the_summer_heat/)*

######**Why should I run in the winter?**

* Winter running makes you strong!

* That person you really want to beat next year is out there training right now

* Spring weather feels so much better when you’ve been training through the winter

* [Some goats somewhere got fast just be being cold]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11124132). Maybe it will work for you, too

######**Clothing**

You’re going to want materials that will keep you warm even when damp or wet. Think wool, fleece, and wicking synthetics. You’ll also want things to be breathable so you don’t get super sweaty (and even colder).  Layer up so you can adjust during your run.

Trapped air is what keeps you warm and cozy in the winter. If you’re shoes are really tight with a couple pairs of socks on, or your gloves/mittens are too tight, you may have less trapped air and impair circulation, which will make you cold.

Here’s an example of what works well for me in calm, dry conditions. Keep in mind wind or precipitation will make things colder, and that it’s always better to have an extra layer than to make do without.

**Temp Range**|**Upper**|**Lower**|**Socks**|**Hands**|**Head**
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
30 to 40F (-1 to 5C)|It’s|Not|Even|Winter|Yet (/r/gatekeeping)
20 to 30F (-6 to -1C)|LS Baselayer|Regular tights|1x midweight wool|Light gloves|headband
10 to 20F (-12 to -6C)|LS Baselayer + wind vest|Thermal tights + windbriefs|2x midweight wool|Mittens|Hat + light gator
0 to 10F (-18 to -12C)|LS Baselayer + Fleece jacket + Wind jacket or vest|Thermal tights + windbriefs + leggings|2x heavier wool socks|Heavy mittens|heavy hat, fleece balaclava, eye protection
<0 F (<-18 C)|LS Baselayer + Fleece jacket + Wind jacket|Thermal tights + windbriefs + leggings|2x heavier wool socks|Heavy mittens w/ gloves underneath|heavy hat x2, fleece balaclava, eye protection (glasses or goggles, if windy)

######**Footwear**

Road shoes are fine most of the time, unless you're running somewhere that consistently has snow or ice-covered sidewalks. If you have good socks, your feet should stay warm even if damp from melting snow. Think more carefully about your footwear if there’s snow or ice on the ground.
On fresh snow or packed, but still soft snow, trail shoes (something with a low to moderate lug) work very well.  [Turning an old pair of road shoes into Screw Shoes](https://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/running-shoe-screws) is an excellent idea for ice, thawed and refrozen snow, and heavily packed snow conditions – the screws do a great job providing a bit of extra traction.

You can also look into traction devices (like Yaktrax, Microspikes, or Nanospikes) when icy.

When running, direction changes and stopping are the most likely times to slip and fall on snow or ice. Slow down and be cautious around corners and street crossings. As you run, make sure you’re landing with your feet underneath your center of mass – even if you do have a slippery step, keep your feet moving, and you can usually recover and avoid a fall.

######**Safety**

If you work during the day, chances are your morning or evening run will be dark. Get yourself a good headlamp (to see and be seen), and wear a reflective vest over your other clothing. Know that motorists may be less likely to expect you to be out running when it’s 15 degrees and snowing.

If it's really cold, make adjustments or plans to ensure you can stay safe during your run even if you turn an ankle or something else happens where you can't keep running to stay warm. Plan your route along safe warm zones (friend's house, grocery stores, etc.), and/or carry your cell phone (close to your body, so your battery doesn't die). If you for some reason can't run, you will quickly get very chilled.

Start your runs into the wind - this will be the coldest part - so that your finish your runs with a warmer tailwind. This can make a big difference - if you get sweaty during your run, and turn into a stiff breeze to finish, you're likely to get chilled as you're heading home.

######**Nutrition**

Even when it’s cold out, you’ll want to be sure you’re hydrated before and during long runs. You’re probably sweating more than you might think, it will evaporate quickly in cold dry air. Have a method to keep fluids from freezing when it’s cold out, either by keeping fluids under a layer of clothing (vest or hydration pack), planning a route around accessible water, or figuring out a way to keep your handheld from freezing up.

Gels and other foods can freeze too – tuck these items into a glove or mitten a few minutes before you want to eat, to thaw them out and warm them up.

### Training

Last year I got interested in running during lockdowns. Prior to this I had never run. After a couple months of running too fast I got terrible shin splints and the next months were spent occasionally running and flaring them up again. At the beginning of this year I followed a 3 month injury recovery plan that was a combination of running and walking until I could run 30min continuously by the end 

Then I followed Hal Higdons base building plan and built up to 30k a week over 3 months. All of these runs were done at a ~8:20/km pace to keep my heart rate down. Then I transitioned to Hal Higdons intermediate Half Marathon Plan which worked up to about 50k/wk and some half marathon pace work (peaking at 13km at half marathon pace). 

My final long run was a week before the half and was 19.5k. This run felt amazing and I negative split, finishing feeling strong and like I could easily have run further. This was done in Melbourne where it was about 13° and had some traffic lights where I stopped and waited. 

### Pre-race
I am still recovering from a cold so woke up at 4:30am and assessed how I felt. Slightly runny nose but otherwise fine so I had some oats and coffee then drove 20min to the run location. 

I arrived at 5:30am and it was 19° and very sunny. Did some stretches lunges to warm up. 

### Race
I decided not to look at my pace until 16k. I knew I had it in me to do a sub 2:30 on a good day but because of the heat I wasn’t sure if it would be possible. I didn’t want to be tempted to pick things up too early. This was a mistake - I should’ve looked at my pace and SLOWED DOWN. I was running by feel but not taking into account the heat. 

The first half of the race felt fine. I took a gel at 10k with a lot of sodium because I was extremely sweaty. Most of the track was in direct sunlight and it was continuing to warm up. Around 14k I started to flag. I had planned to take my second gel at 17k but decided I needed it at 16. I was extremely thirsty but the bubblers all had warm water. 

The last 5k of this race were the hardest running I have ever done. I ended up walking a lot. I kept telling myself “after this walk you will run all the way to the end” and then having to walk again. I felt pretty defeated at this point. 

Managed to pick up the pace in the last 500m at least. 

### Post-race
I am proud of myself for finishing. I found the end of this race extremely mentally difficult and learned a lot of lessons. Moving forward I am going to control my pace a lot better at the beginning and only pick it up later. Which I knew in theory but I love learning things the hard way apparently. 

In some ways I’m glad I didn’t make it sub 2:30 because I feel like this is an attainable goal for the next time I run a half. I’m excited to spend my next training block focussing on the 5k so I can finally start to get a little faster. 

Next big goal is a marathon before I’m 30!

### Training
33M who was not athletic most of my life, hit the gym and got in shape in 2017, then started running a little bit (usually from 10-15 miles a week) in 2018.  My first marathon in 2019 involved a lot of mistakes, a bonk at mile 21, and a death march to the finish.   Last spring, after some consistent training over a couple of years, I was able to run the distance properly and finally achieve a sub-4 hour (3:54) time, which was my original goal in 2019 and a 20 minute PR.  I found so much joy in the process of seeking that redemption, but I realized I could still keep working at it to improve when it came to the marathon.

I had finally begun to train seriously and relatively injury free, and saw steady improvement in my PRs over all distances over the last two years.  I followed Pfitz 18/55, and aside from two bouts of the flu and a flare-up of some old foot pain which kept me sidelined for a few days, I completed all the prescribed mileage of the plan and paced my long runs and workouts with a goal time of 3:30.  The frustrating part of the illnesses is they were both on weeks when I had a 20 mile big run planned and had to cancel, so overall I only completed 1 of the three 20-mile runs the plan called for, but I didn’t miss a single other long run or workout, and hit that one 20-miler with 4x5k at marathon pace and it went down smooth.   The plan was just the right amount of hitting new highs in overall volume, with workouts that challenged but didn’t completely destroy me.   It was hard enough though that I had to take my easy days REALLY easy, sometimes shuffling along at 3 minutes per mile slower that my marathon pace, just so I could recover in time to be able to crush the next hard efforts which were always right around the corner.


### Pre-race
Lots of carb loading with pancakes, white rice, and Gatorade 2-3 days before and some PB banana toast the morning of the race.  

The race being in my home of South Florida, I was prepared to have the adjust the expectations and race plan if the forecast was warm and humid, and it turned out to be exactly that (72 degrees F and 92 percent humidity).  Rain was forecasted which would have been helpful to cool off, but it became apparent just before starting that the rain would not come for the first few hours of the race, so I thankfully made decision to go shirtless, pin my bib to my shorts, and do the first few miles 15-20 seconds per mile slower than my planned goal pace, and if I was feeling okay after 2/3 of the way in, I would make the call to adjust if I could.  

Peed 4 times before the race.  I may have over hydrated in preparation, or maybe it was the nerves.  Took a GU with caffeine right at the start, polished off the Gatorade, and we were off!

### Race
Right at the start and periodically through the first mile there was a huge bottleneck, but I made sure to err on the side of slowing down after any weaving and bobbing to get past other runners and pace-checking myself regularly to avoid the heart rate spiking at all.  After that first mile I could tell it was a good call to adjust the expectations because I was already sweating a lot and it wasn’t evaporating off my skin that well. 

Miles 2-16

These miles went by uneventfully and I stopped worrying too much about my reach time goal, which I knew was probably out of the question with the weather, and just ran.  I was honestly just so happy that this day had finally come, that I was here, feeling good, and running my race.  Found a groove, and in hindsight, this zen-state helped lower my heart rate while still cruising.  Every time I checked my watch and saw my pace was 15 seconds slower than I had planned and trained for, I just kept reminding myself that the arbitrary goal was one that I set for myself assuming the weather would be perfect, which it was not.  Besides, these 8:15 miles were already 40 seconds per mile faster than my marathon pace was just less than 10 months ago! Took a GU every 3.5 miles, and drank Gatorade or water (alternating, sometimes did both) at every aid station.  Had to pee again at mile 4, but there was only one spot along the entire marathon course that had portapottys, and that was at mile 7, so I had to hold it until then (bad look for the organizers, but that was the LEAST of the problems with this race, which I’ll cover later in the recap).   The pee break was life-altering, truly an out of body experience, and I didn’t care about the time lost (40 seconds total, 35 of which were spent pressure-washing the inside of the toilet bowl).  Once I hit the road again I felt so good that I picked up the pace for the next couple of miles and covered the time lost without much issue.

Miles 16-19

The course is pancake flat with an out-and-back loop along the road that hugs the beach coastline.  During these miles, the ocean breeze came and cooled us off which it was very much appreciated…until it was not, lol.  I’m not sure if it was a net positive or a detriment, but there definitely was a strong headwind that made it hard to run faster.  Despite this, we had long passed the half-marathon mark by this point, and there were fewer runners on the road, so when I pulled up alongside another runner who was falling off a bit, I offered to him to get behind me so I could help break the wind for him.  His response: “you want me to get behind you so you can break wind in front of me?!”  Got a good laugh out of me, which was then followed by me doing exactly that for a couple of miles.  Around mile 18, we reached the part of the course where the buildings blocked the wind, and so I wished him luck and we parted ways.  

Miles 19-26

“Wow, I’m feeling too good,” I thought to myself.  This was supposed to be a big battle, a final boss, a pain-cave experience that I had been building up in my head for months, and I realized that with 7 miles left, I needed to really test myself and all the training I had put myself through more, otherwise I’d regret leaving time on the table. Over the next three miles, I picked up the pace and every time I looked down at the watch, I’d be surprised to see I had sped up so much while my perceived effort was tough but tolerable.  Around mile 23, I realized this is why progression runs and fast-finish long runs are so psychologically beneficial.  It’s training for this moment, because every mile closer to the end of the run means one less mile that you have to worry about saving energy for the next.  Every mile I ticked off, I asked myself “can I do X more miles at this pace? I’ve done it feeling worse than this!” And sped up a little.  Mile 25 had a big cheering section but there weren’t any other runners passing by at the time; I was so amped up that I yelled at the crowd to make noise, and they went wild with me.  It was awesome, and probably why that was my fastest mile split at 7:16.  Lots of high fives and finger-guns.

Miles 26-26.7

Yes, you read that right.  After gutting out the hardest mile of my life, the watch beeps for 26 and the finish line is nowhere in sight.  Come to think of it, the mile markers seemed to have all been way off from my watch too. What gives?

I’ll be honest, I was so happy and hyped up that I didn’t even notice the extra half mile.  When the finish line finally appeared before me, I let out a huge cheer to the crowd and fist pumped my way across the line.  The watch and the clock said 3:34, a 20 minute personal best and 40 minutes faster than my first marathon 5 years ago.  My wife, daughter, and MIL were cheering with a sign for me at the finish, and I gave then all a big hug and dumped some cold water on my back.

### Post-race
It turns out I actually ran a marathon in 3:31 minutes, but the “official” time is 3:34, because the race organizers mismeasured the course and everybody had to run (regardless of Apple Watch, garmin, coros, etc) an extra 0.4-0.5 miles to finish.  The distance was wrong for both the half and the full.  After a week of saying nothing and getting roasted on their social media accounts, the race finally sent out an acknowledgement email apologizing and saying they did indeed accidentally make the distance too long. 

I applaud them for admitting it, however and whenever they did.  This is a race that has been around for years and that people use as a qualifier for other marathons, so it was really surprising that such an error could have happened.  For me though, the race was the pinnacle of a lot of hard work and good execution.  Had I known I was only a minute or two from my reach goal, maybe I could have tried to drop the pace a little sooner to hit my reach goal, but the number is not as important to me as the effort and the outcome.  

I used to have body image issues as a kid and young adult.  Still might sometimes, but after months of focused training, I’m glad to say I honestly didn’t think twice to take my shirt off in the 90%+ humidity.  Im happy to see the race pictures of me reflect how little I cared about anything other than celebrating the work I’ve put in and enjoying the experience (and just generally being very hyped all day).  15 lbs heavier than I was 5 years ago, my marathon time is now also 40 minutes faster, with a 20-minute improvement in just 9 months.  Train well, eat well, and nobody cares what you look like (or how fast or slow you are, for that matter) as long as you show up for yourself.

Gonna spend the spring and summer in the gym and on the track, and then try to build my running base up again for another marathon plan in the fall to hopefully smash that 3:30 goal and keep the PB train rolling, for as long as my body lets me!

### Training
I'm training for my first marathon (Brighton) and wanted to do Brighton Half, which is 6 weeks out from the marathon. My training wasn't tailored to the half distance but I wanted to give it a good go. I did my second half in October and got 1:44:59 and was hoping to get a PB. I was also hoping to maybe sneak under 1:40 but alas... Not this time! I had also been a donkey and gone over on my ankle a couple weeks before. It was feeling much better and was hoping it wouldn't cause issues. 

My training has essentially been a gentle 5k on Mondays with a group I run with (most of us did the C25K together in 2022 and it's just been a social run we've kept going). I run with my club every Tuesday and most Thursdays. This usually consists of some form of speed work. If there's not a session on a Thursday, I try and get out for a run anyway but not a speed session. I also lift weights three times a week. 

My longer runs have been on weekends, which have gradually been building up. The weekend before the half, I did 30k as my long run, to give an idea of where I'm at with that. I've been really enjoying the training so far. I sometimes do my long run on a Sunday but other times, I'll go out on the Saturday and join the club for their Sunday social run (often about 10 miles, but we can turn early or go further if we fancy). It's often trail, which is a pleasant change, as I mostly do road running.

The week before the half, I skipped my leg day I took it easier on the Tuesday session and did a gentle run on the Friday. Anyway, enough rambling. 

### Pre-race
Nervous, as always. This was my third half and I wasn't worried about the distance. I usually get nervous about the logistics of the day more than the race itself. But a few of us from the running club bundled into the car and made our way to Brighton, which isn't too far for us. I'd got everything ready the night before and had a bowl of porridge and decaf coffee (my gut doesn't like caffeine when I'm running) for breakfast. I also munched on a bar on the way there. 
I had two gels on me for the race and I didn't carry water. I don't really know if I need two gels but I stuck with it for this one, as that's what I did last time and it worked for me. 
I had my bib already, so we took our warm clothes off and handed in our bags. It was a pretty chilly day with some wind coming off the sea. We made the long walk to our pens. A couple of my club mates were in the same pen as me, so we stuck together before the start. The wheelchair race started (saw them later, which was awesome!) and after a few minutes delay, we were off! 

### Race
It's overall a flat race, but at the start, you go right at the Sealife centre and go up a creeping incline. I didn't really feel it luckily, especially as that's when everyone's finding their pace and settling in. Everyone around me settled into a pretty similar pace to start, so there was no weaving or hustle and bustle, which was a relief. I did find the camber of the road a bit challenging and was hoping it wouldn't upset my ankle / foot again. 

Thankfully, it didn't rain during the race. The forecast has changed to say it'd rain in the afternoon. 

The first 5k zipped by. A teammate and I leapfrogged each other for a bit and because of the first section being an out-and-back, we both caught sight of some other teammates. 

I was worried I was going a bit quickly at points. My 1:40 goal was really just a ""if I feel fantastic and everything falls into place, I could get this"" goal. So I wasn't intending to set off at that pace. I knew I felt good but... You should feel good that early! 

I took my first gel at 7k, as planned. I was grabbing a cup of water at water stations too. I've not quite mastered the art of drinking from a cup when running. I try the pinch and sip method but I do usually almost drown myself. Live and learn! 

The course was interesting enough but not too twisty, so you could really settle in. I was trying to take everything in, as I often forget a lot of races once I've finished them. Surprise, I still forgot most of it. 

Anyway, onward. I went past a teammate at some point who'd set out too fast and I felt kind of bad for him. I feel like most of us have done that at some point. I forgot to note that this was my first race in my club vest! It was great hearing people shout for me and also being able to spot each other easily in the mass of runners. 

Everything zipped by and I felt great. Took my second gel at 14k, motoring along nicely. I had been told ahead of time that when you turn left back along the seafront at 17k, you can basically see where you'll be finishing. But it's 4k away. So... That happened. I looked up and thought ""bloody hell that's a long way to go"". And almost instantly, the headwind coming from the sea blasted everyone. The final 4k was a proper slog and battle against the wind. I could see my pace dropping and, no matter how much effort I put in, I just was not getting it back. On top of that, I felt a slight niggle in that ankle. Nothing painful or alarming though. I knew 1:40 wasn't going to happen. That's fine. Just keep going. Those final kms were ticking off very slowly. Considering how earlier in the race, I couldn't believe how quickly it was all going. 3k to go. 2k to go. I was getting tired pushing against the wind. 1k to go. Now I really wanted to be done with this. You expect to see the finish from further back, but it's tucked away around a slight bend. So, it suddenly popped up into sight. I went for it as much as I could and crossed the line. I missed the 1:40 goal but I was chuffed. 

### Post-race
I started to get very cold very quickly. They gave us foil blankets and a can of water each. We got a goodie bag and a medal. There was a fair walk back to the baggage area. Bumped into a couple of teammates and we all pulled on our trackies and hoodies, doing our best to stay warm. I grabbed a coffee and we waited for the other teammates we'd come with. We all discussed the brutal wind but our gratefulness for the lack of rain  (very British). Once we were all back together, we went for some food. And then it rained. A day well spent!

### Training

37/m, Off and on runner for most of my adult life never going more than 3-4 miles and never averaging more than 15-20 miles a week. One year ago I decided to run the 10k at Cowtown and it was my longest run ever. Following that I committed to doing the one thing I always told myself I could never do: run a marathon. 

I spent spring and summer building a base of 25 or so mpw and then around September took a two month break before picking up a marathon training program because I thought at the time it would be best to begin fully rested (lol, wish I had kept that fitness to begin the plan in November…)

I started lurking Reddit and learned about the Hal Higdon plans and downloaded the app and used the novice 1 plan that ran 4 days a week and peaked at just shy of 40 mpw with one 20 mile run 4 weeks out. I followed the plan aggressively, always running just a little bit farther and a little bit faster than suggested. I saw incredible gains, and quickly I noticed my 12:00/mile marathon pace became my 12:00/mile easy pace. 

When it came time for my 20 miler I promised myself to run what felt easy and not look at my watch at all. At the end of the run I noticed fairly consistent 11:30 splits so I started to believe I could potentially run faster that my original 5hr goal.

### Pre-race

I had a wonderful pasta dinner with an ice cream sundae bar to follow with some good friends who helped me stay distracted. I am a bit of a worrier, so I need things to do to occupy myself. I set out all my clothes and arranged them just nice. 

Somehow I actually slept pretty well, getting about 7hrs of sleep and waking up at 4am to drink 12oz of water, eat two slices of peanut butter and honey toast, blueberries, and a 12oz coffee. I also sipped on a Gatorade throughout the early morning. Bathroom, dressed, and my wife dropped me off at the start about 30mins before the gun. 

I located the 4:35 pace group and kept them in my eyes because I made up my mind that I was going to try for it, and maybe even see if I could pull away at the end and hit 4:30.

### Race

I was in corral 5 which left me standing there for about 20 extra minutes. I knew I was going to have to pee within the first 10k but the crowds were insane so I put that away and said we would deal with it when it comes. 

Finally it was our turn and the funnel kept me farther back from the 4:35 pace group than I would like. All of my runs had been solo so it was really overwhelming to navigate beginning a race crammed together with so many people. Thankfully I happened upon a family from my church who was running the half and I chatted with them while the crowds were shuffling along the first half mile. This was a helpful distraction and by the time things settled down they slowed down and we said farewell. The 4:35 pace group was still in sight and I made my way to them by the time I hit mile marker 1. 

The first 10k the pacer was averaging really close to 10 minute miles. I thought my watch was crazy until I heard a lot of people around me discussing this to themselves every mile. It felt good and I figured they must have some strategy for what’s ahead. During mile 8 I couldn’t hold it anymore and I found an open porta potty so I used it. Lost about 30 seconds to my pace, but somehow never found that pace group again. I was on my own to figure out my pace. 

The spectators and the overall revelry of everybody was energizing and inspiring. I spent so much time taking it all in that I didn’t notice how much faster I was running. Between miles 9-21 I was somewhere between 9:30-10:15 in my splits with a lot of them in the 9:30-10:00 range. I felt like I was absolutely crushing it! My family met me at two different stops at mile 12 and 19, i stopped for a second to give hugs, take a selfie, and let the kids run with me a few steps so they could say they “ran in a marathon” :) I felt amazing and even started doing math in my head about what I could accomplish if I held on here at this point. I laugh now in hindsight at that sweet marathon newbie biting off more than he could chew. 

My fueling had been consistent with a gel every 30, Gatorade and/or water at every aid station with my own bottle of Gatorade with me that I occasionally sipped from. But at mile 22 I started fading a bit. I feel like my stomach stopped taking in anything at this point and it just felt like sloshing around and uncomfortable. I envisioned the last 10k being me giving this race everything I had to see what I could do at the end. What I didn’t realize is that it was everything I had just to sustain, and it was hard to do even that. Miles 22-25 were a whole new level of difficult for me. I was willing my body to move with everything I had but still noticed I was slowing down with 11:00+ minute miles. 

With one mile to go I realized that it was still possible to hit sub 4:30, and it’s a long and slightly uphill stretch all the way to the finish line. When I saw all the cheering fans I somehow managed to summon a sprint to the finish! I couldn’t even tell what my time was and I didn’t even read my watch when I ended the workout.  I just stumbled my way through the hospitality area with the manta “don’t throw up” repeating in my head. I found my family, my wife had tears and congratulated me which gave me tears and I was so grateful. Overwhelmingly grateful.

### Post-race

I spent a little bit of time with the family at the venue but it was getting hot (nearing 80°!) so we drove home. I took an ice bath, at leftover pasta, and took it easy replaying as much as I could in my mind and messaging back and forth with people who cared and wanted to know how everything went. Overwhelmingly grateful. 

My quads feel like they died, and my knees are throbbing still. But movement helps and I’ve done a couple of walks which have helped immensely. 

I’m now wondering where to go from here. What started as a bucket list item turned into something I’ve become really passionate about and I’d like to see what I am capable of! Plenty of time to read and ponder this while my body recovers.

999,1708999847.0,Hashawha Hills 50k 2024 Race Report,"On Saturday, I ran the Hashawha Hills 50k for the 6th time. It is the only ultra I've done more than once. Why does this one keep drawing me back? Well, it's no mystery: it's cheap ($18.75 this year, and they generally reduce the price every year), you get a sweet hand-made ceramic mug for finishing, and a few of my friends are always doing it too.

That last is a bit of a change from my [2018 report](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/804wfi/hashawha_hills_50k_race_report_ii_the_sequel_part/) of this race, which I finished by mentioning that I'd made some new friends. Back in 2018 (and in 2016 when [I ran this race the first time](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/48dekw/hashawha_hills_50k_race_report/)), I didn't know a lot of the local running folks, but since joining the local running club in 2019, I have made some lifelong friends, including the guy I referred to as ""Steeps"" in the 2018 report. In fact, we carpooled to this race in 2020, 2022, and this year.

Running clubs! Instant friends, just add water (in the form of sweat).

I set my course PR at this race in 2020, with a 6:04:13. Last year, this race was the last race I did before taking 2 months off for plantar fasciitis, but I still managed 6:19:55. My goals this year?

**C goal**: beat last year's time (<6:19:55)  
**B goal**: set a new course PR (<6:04:13)  
**A goal**: <6:00:00  
**Smeagol**: Have fun

Bold, I know. Especially since one might say I'm still recovering from a 100 miler I did last month. I might say that. I am one.

The course PR would be especially sweet because the course is about 2 miles longer than it was when I set that PR, coming in these days at 51k (about 31.6 miles) instead of the scant 48k (29.8 miles) that it was before. What are you going to do, the race costs less than $20. So I had my work cut out for me.

The course is two loops of whatever half of 31.6 miles is, covering some pretty gnarly trail, epic hills that just keep going up, some corn fields (sans corn), and a nice bit of road to shake off the mud. It includes 4 stream crossings, plus a couple random creeks that you may or may not get through with your feet dry, depending on the weather. There has never, in my 6 times running this race, not been mud. I don't care how nice it is, there is always mud. The mud wasn't too bad this year though. There is one aid station that you hit twice during each loop, plus the start/finish aid station between loops. It's terrible, and I love it.

I slept very poorly the night before the race, as is tradition. I ""woke up"" (actually decided to get out of bed and dismiss my alarm 30 minutes before it was scheduled to go off), made coffee, did Wordle and Connections, had a good poo, got dressed, and headed over to Steeps' house for carpooling. On the way, I picked up a breakfast sandwich from Sheetz, as is tradition, and threatened to establish dominance in Steeps' guest bathroom, but abstained once I got there and realized there was nothing in the chamber. As Steeps was driving us to the race, we had a newbie in the backseat who we were regaling with tales of years past. She was thoroughly unimpressed.

We arrived, met up with our other friends who were running, and settled in while we waited for the race briefing to start. In the first two years I ran this race, I sat in that room and marveled at how groups of people would come together and greet each other as old friends who hadn't seen each other in a while. This year, I was one of those people. Good vibes all around. This race is a local favorite. I hate it.

I was prepped and ready. I took my pre-race aspirin and salt capsule, and I had my vest with a bottle of water and a bottle of tea. I had perfectly selected my clothes to match the temperature. Everything was perfect. So we started the race, and ruined what was turning out to be a pretty nice day.

There's not much to say, but there are notes of memory: The first quarter mile of this race is a slightly uphill paved road. Someone will always comment that they refuse to run that part as I run past them, muttering to myself that it's one of the few crushable parts of the course. But then, I love running uphill, and am very skittish going down. I also don't particularly like running trail, but here we are.

I actually didn't make a single wrong turn this year. I almost always miss the right turn in the swampy lollipop area, which is a name I just made up for that area.

I passed people on the uphills, and they would pass me on the downs. But ultimately I would pass them for good. The secret is that this course is uphill the whole way, even though it's a double loop. Just a weird geographical oddity.

I came into the aid station, had a couple pierogis, as is tradition, and a couple of the homemade chocolate chip cookies, which I think I've slept on in years past, because those are some really good cookies. I avoided the broth, even though it has done good things for me.

The section after the aid station is where most of the new 2 miles is. It's a rolling single track with a couple creek crossings (unless you want to brave the slippery log going across one section) that seems to go on forever, and in the wrong direction, but eventually dumps you out not far from where you got on, which I think is part of the whole geographical oddity thing. I did something here that I don't often do in races, and I think I need to start doing it more often: I let someone else set the pace. I let them pick their way along the trail, and just laid in behind them. They were going a bit slower than I wanted to go, but it was worth it to take the mental load off. The reason I don't really like running trail is that it's mentally exhausting. I can't zone out the way I can on the road. But if someone is in front of you, you can kind of zone out.

Once I realized we were getting back to the fire road and the open fields, I pulled around my pacer and set off. It was still another couple miles back to the aid station, but I stayed ahead of the people I'd run with on the trail. Nobody passed me once the initial shakeout was done at the beginning of the race.

Back at the aid station, I grabbed another couple pierogis, and a couple more cookies, along with a cup of Mountain Dew that I verified was not pickle juice (not making that mistake again), and headed down to the big stream crossing. This is the one that everyone looks forward to. It's about 30 feet across, and it was knee deep this year. Of course it's February, so the water temperature is best described as ""somewhat bracing"". It was lovely and surprisingly refreshing stomping through that water, although it took a half mile after I got out before I could feel my toes again.

The section after the second time at the aid station is maybe 4 or 4.5 miles, and it's my favorite part. It sucks, and has the worst hellish hill on the whole course, but it's my favorite. Looking at my time as I finished up the first loop, I saw that I'd be coming in just under 3 hours, so I probably wouldn't get under 6 for the whole thing. My second loop is usually 20 or 30 minutes slower than my first. But I thought I could still make the course PR (6:04:13) if I really pushed, and definitely beat last year's time (6:19:55).

I finished the first loop, grabbed a couple bites of food, filled up my water bottle with water, and my tea bottle with Gatorade, as is tradition, and headed out for the second loop at 2:57.

""But then again,"" I thought, ""I'm actually feeling pretty good. I should at least try to push this second loop and get that sweet sub 6. That would require an even split. So let's go for a negative split to be sure.""

**A+ goal**: negative fucking split

The funny thing here is that I've never negative split a race in my life. I always go out fast, and then burn out. It's tradition.

So basically, go back a few paragraphs and reread. I did the same thing. I ran up the paved portion at the beginning. I ran up all the uphills, and skittished my way down the downs, although slightly less skittishly. I passed more people. I ate pierogis and cookies. I caught up to a couple of friends who shepherded me through the 2 mile section of trail that I needed someone to guide me through, and then pulled ahead of them as we approached the fire road. The two of them are pretty strong runners, and usually are way out of my class, but there was a combination of them having a bad day, and me having a good day, that caused me to be able to pass them. I told them to stop being such pussies, as is tradition, but thanked them for the guidance.

Simply put, I crushed the second loop, and especially the second half of the second loop. And let me be real with you right now. I have not been doing too well lately. I've been going through some shit. And while I have gotten teary eyed during a race before, and I have occasionally cried at the end of a race, I have never flat out sobbed like a baby while running like I did at mile... let's say 29ish. I was pretty fucking stoked to show myself how strong I am, and I left a lot of crap out there on that trail. I climbed that hell hill (the Strava segment is just called ""Pain""), elated that I was about to finish with a negative fucking split, and then my right adductor cramped up completely at the top of the hill, and I couldn't move.

As is motherfucking tradition.

I massaged it and cursed at it. I don't know which worked better, but I was able to get back to limp running within a minute, and then I was able to run without a limp a little after that. I rolled it in hard for the last mile, willing myself not to trip on anything, shed a few more tears, and finished the second loop with a negative fucking split time of 2:53ish, for a 5:49:32 finish.

My friend Matt greeted me at the finish line and I sobbed into his shoulder, because we are both manly men and we can cry. ""Do you need a drink?"" he asked me. God yes.

Back at the nature center, I changed into dry clothes and waited for my friends to finish. We swapped lies, told stories, and smelled bad. For a glorious morning and into the afternoon, I escaped with my friends. And I think that's why I keep coming back.",running

### Training
I trained using a modified version of Hal Higdon's Intermediate 1 HM plan. It was my first time going through with a real training plan other than ""run a few times a week"" and it was fairly manageable as I only planned 4 runs a week ( Long Run + recovery run on the weekend, and a tuesday/thursday run). This was slightly complicated by the weather being... winter, but that's kind of the point since the theme of the race is of course that it's in the middle of winter.  

In the end, I was aiming to just match my first HM pace of 4:53/km from the fall, but taking into account the cold that would be a big win!   

The biggest difference between this and my last HM were that I had zero injury or joint pain during this cycle, maybe I did not train hard enough? (training pace was between 5:00/km to 5:30/km for non race pace runs, or 4:50/km ish for ""race pace""

### Pre-race
My plans the night before the race were to run a *very* casual 5k, and get to bed 10 hours before I would need to wake up. Unfortunately this was challenged by one of my dogs eating a chunk of pork bone and needing to go to the vet hospital that night (a bit stressful, but she was fine, and the vet said she would have likely been fine anyways).  Barring less sleep than anticipated, the morning pre-race began fine; coffee, bagel, and fruit 2 hours before the race. 

Due to fear about the possibility of rain on race-day I bought a water resistant jacket (Patagonia Houdini) the night prior to the event. This was an important decision.

### Race
I had been training in sub-zero (celsius) conditions, with and without my favourite seasonal precipitation (snow). I was ill prepared, even with my new jacket, for just-above-freezing temps and POURING rain for the entire race. 

Adrenaline was able to carry me well until the mid point of the race, but my joggers were not water resistant and collected so much water; my gloves as well were not helpful as they got soaked.  

The last half of the race was an absolute slog and I truly was operating with huge chunks of meat that felt 20 pounds heavier than at the start. More hill training would have also helped! (live and learn)

I was barely able to muster a ""sprint"" to the finish in the last 500 meters, but almost 6 minutes faster than my last PB! (netted me in 9th of 44!!)

Another takeaway is that I would probably bring gels next time instead of gummies, the added caffeine really might have made a huge difference in my morale, and sat less heavy on my stomach.

### Post-race
The post race festivities were at a brewery/pub and I had a delicious meal before driving an hour home in horrible freezing rain and 10+cm of snow.

### Training
I had a lot of running experience back in middle and high school on cross country and track teams, but once I went off to college I kind of sat around and did nothing athletic for several years. This past June a friend of mine got me into running again, and we went through a 12 week training plan for a half marathon last October which went really well and got me into the running bug again. The day I finished that half, I set my sights on running a full.

I looked around and found the Ventura marathon as it was one of the faster courses, not terribly far away, and 20 weeks out from the October half which gave me the perfect amount of time for one of [Hal Higdon's 18 week plans](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-1-marathon/). My training for the half marathon had me running 4 days a week which was a nice way to get back into it, but I knew I wanted to start running at least 5 days a week so I went with the intermediate 1 plan (with the intent that if my legs started to feel too dead or I felt too fatigued I could always scale back to a novice plan).

Early in the plan I stuck to it to a T including stationary cycling as cross-training. Maybe I was going too hard on the cycling, but I found it fatigued my muscles *a lot* and affected my runs, so I decided to have 2 rest days a week and skip the cross training. In retrospect I wish I had done some strength based training as I'll get to later, but that's something I will be incorporating in my next training cycle. Outside of that, training went as smooth as I could hope for. I loved the long runs on the weekends and the 5 days a week of training gave me a nice routine.

### Pre-race
I don't think I've ever gotten more than 4 hours of sleep before a race lmao. My normal sleep schedule tends to be midnight to 8am as I'm way more of a night-owl, so hopping in bed at 7:30pm for a 3:30am wake up call left me restless and unable to sleep for several hours. Too many pre-race jitters.

That said I woke up right on time, got all of my gear on I had laid out the night before, made sure to use the restroom twice, and snagged some breakfast. Naturally, something had to go haywire though because as soon as I got on the start-line my stomach turned and I had to poop. Never had this happen on my long runs, so looks like I need to be more careful around my fiber intake near races. That combined with all of the nerves is just an awful combo.

### Race
What I learned to appreciate a lot about this race organizer though were the porta potties located at every aid station. I decided I'd try to stick with the 3:40 pacer for the first couple miles to build up a bit of a lead on my 3:45 ideal pace so the effect of my inevitable pit-stop was lessened. Once I hit mile 4 I made the quickest restroom trip of my life, and was out in under 2 minutes. Mistake #1 was not being better about monitoring my GI tract, mistake #2 was letting the psychological affect of stopping for 2 minutes cause me to spend too much energy trying to get back to where I was so early in the race.

Once I got back in the swing of things though the next several miles luckily flew by much smoother. Once I hit the halfway mark though, I started to feel my legs a bit more than I usually do at 13 miles. That's when I got a feeling the tail end of the race will be a lot more rougher than I hoped. I pushed that thought out of my head, found some people to pack up with, and carried on.

Things continued to get slightly harder, but still manageable until about mile 20 (the farthest I had ever run until that point). That's when I realized mistake #3: I did not train on downhills as much as I should have. My whole training up to that point was about 95% flat ground running. I had assumed that if I could run well on flat ground, running on a slight decline would simply be easier. Which it is for the most part, but long stretches of continuous downhill stressed my quads and stabilizers way more than I anticipated. Once I hit the last 5-6 mile stretch that was all flat ground, I entered the gauntlet.

I had never felt such intense aches and tension in my legs before. It wasn't sharp pain like an injury, but my feet felt like lead and my quads & hamstrings like cold, stiff rubber. It was frustrating as my cardio felt fine, my heart rate was in check, and I had plenty of energy - but every sigle part of the lower half of my body wanted to stop and sit on the ground. The only thing keeping me upright was my watch telling me that I was on pace to go below 3:40 and crush my goal, which I luckily managed to do.

### Post-race
The second I crossed the finish line and collected my medal, I beelined for the closest patch of grass under a shaded tree to lay down for half an hour. Though I stretched soon after, my legs are ungodly sore today, making stairs my #1 enemy. I overextended my limits forsure, and while I had a positive outcome I'm lucky I didn't injure something. Will be taking at least 6 months before going for my next marathon, need to work in some strength training and higher base mileage.

### Training
I ran my first half marathon in Philidelphia a few months ago and had an unbelievable time.  My goal for that race was to be sub 2:00, and I was able to meet that through a lot of training with a 1:58:41. I immediately knew I wanted to book another race, so my friends and I booked the Asheville half in March.  Shortly after that, I had a separate trip booked in Tampa and realized it was the same weekend as the Gasparilla half.  I decided to register for fun as a prep for Asheville.  To make a long story short, I had a lot of life changes happen between registering and this past weekend, so unlike training for the race in Philadelphia, my training (if you could even call it that) was scattered and unregimented.  I went on roughly 10 runs between December and yesterday with the longest being 7 miles.


I was fairly anxious the week leading up to the race, but I kept reminding myself that I was just doing this for fun and not to worry about the time.  I had proven to myself I could run a half in under 2 hours, so I set that as my stretch goal with my realistic goal being sub 2:10.  The few long runs I went on between December and yesterday all went pretty well with average mile times in the 8:30 range, so I felt that was reasonable.  As an aside, I clearly need to focus on slower running in training.


The main thing I focused on the few days before the race was eating enough.  I did not do that for Philadelphia, and around the mile 10 mark, I could feel myself running out of energy.  I generally am not a big eater, but I made sure I took in a lot of calories Thursday and Friday without making myself uncomfortable, and on Saturday I ate a standard amount of food for me.

### Pre-race
First, I did not realize this race was a 6am start until a few days before.  I forced myself to wake up at 4:30am on Saturday so I would be able to sleep the night before the race, and this strategy worked.  I was asleep by 10:30pm Saturday night and woke up without my alarm around 3:45 feeling surprisingly rested.  I had a little coffee and was ready to go.


I had scheduled an uber the night before for 4:45am and got to the race around 5:10am.  While in the car, I listened to music to get myself in the right headspace, and while I was telling myself the time didn't matter, my competitive side kept telling me that I had it in me to run a good race.  My uber dropped me off, I ate a rice crispy treat (my favorite pre-run/workout snack) and I walked around in the cool dark morning familiarizing myself with the start line, and just took it all in.  I brought a small bag and didn't realize that the bag check was in the convention center and not near the start line.  Not a big deal, but note to self and others to review where the bag check is before you show up.  Thankfully I had plenty of time and this gave me a good opportunity for a light jog to warm up and let out the nerves.


As start time got closer, I was continually surprised at how good I felt.  I made my way to the corral and decided to start behind the 2:00 pacer like I did in Philadelphia.  The start was a little disorganized, so as people pushed in, the pacers moved around, and I ended up toward the back of the group behind the 1:55 pacer.  I decided this would serve the same purpose, as long as I couldn't see the 2:00 pacer, I knew I was doing alright.

The weather was clear and slightly crisp, energy was high, and my run started at 6:03am.

### Race
I told myself to start slow, but given the adrenaline and the group I was with, that did not happen.  The first half mile I was pushing much faster than I intended.  It's hard to let people pass, but I made my way from the middle of the road to the left side and reminded myself that this is a (half) marathon, not a sprint.  I was feeling good though, and the first mile went by very quickly.  9:01. OK, I thought, a little faster than I wanted to start - I wanted to be more in the (9:15-9:30 range to warmup) - but that's ok.  Let people pass, run your race.  The 1:55 pacer was still in sight, so I eased up and just told myself, settle in.  This was something I said to myself countless times during the race.


As I finished the second mile I could feel that I was pushing a little harder than I wanted, but I still felt ok.  My wrist vibrated and I looked down.  8:41.  My stomach slightly dropped.  This was way faster than I intended, and surely I would burn out if I didn't slow down.  Also, what the hell is this pacer doing going so fast?  When they spun the sign around at the start it showed that the pace would be 8:57.  That's the only reason I was ok with keeping up.  This is when I realized that, using simple math, I must have misread the sign.  I wasn't running with an 8:57 pacer, I was running with an 8:47 pacer.  I decided to slow it down, keep the group generally in sight, and settle in.


Miles 1.5-3 are usually my hardest.  I can feel my legs getting tight and it's harder to breathe.  I've watched YouTube videos that this is common, and that was the case here.  I was able to keep my anxiety and breathing in check and reminded myself that by mile 3 I would be feeling good, and that is exactly what happened.  Around mile 3 I was feeling fresh, I was somehow on a great pace, and the sun was just starting to rise.  It was absolutely beautiful, and I looked around at the palm trees and reminded myself of how lucky I was to be down in Florida on a run and seeing all of this.  I couldn't stop smiling and turned my music up, thrilled that I was having a blast.  Part of me was worried that I would be miserable after the first leg, but I was already proving to myself that I had way more in me than I thought.  The next few miles felt the same as we finished our loop of the island and made our way to the long stretch down and back on Bayshore Boulevard along the bay.


My brother-in-law ran this race last year, and he told me that miles 5-13 were tough mentally.  He was right.  This part of the race is gorgeous as you're running along the water, but it is long and straight.  And then you turn around, and it is long and straight.  I'm really glad that I was mentally prepared for this, as I was still on a crazy fast pace (for me), and once again, told myself to settle in, enjoy the sunrise, and don't look too far ahead because it's just going to look the same.


The biggest pivot I made in this race was my view of aid stations.  In Philadelphia, my main goal was to run without stopping.  I'm not an experienced runner, so in my mind, if you stopped running during a race, you didn't *really* run it.  Naive, I'm aware, but that was my perspective.  I mentioned earlier that in Philadelphia, around mile 10 my body substantially ran out of energy.  I wonder why that is?  During that race, I grabbed water while I was moving like I had seen people in the Olympics, took in maybe 1/10 of what was in the cup, inhaled half of that, and then was left coughing and more out of breath than I was before the aid station.  Not this time.  I stopped at every aid station (roughly every mile), alternating between water and endurance Gatorade.  For the majority of the race, I walked a few feet while I drank my cup, and then kept going.  Massive difference.  I was hydrated, and it gave me a brief respite to look forward to each mile.  This was great, but it did cause me to make a quick bathroom break around mile 7 (which you can see in my mile times).  I had to fight with myself to stop, but I am so glad that I did.  Reminder for my next race, don't be afraid to stop.


Everything was going great until mile 10.  Shoutout to the guy who gave me a Dunkin Munchkin around mile 8.  Note to self: next time, don't try and take that down in one bite, they are super dry and surprisingly big.  Very grateful there was a station with water about a minute later.


Mile 10.  The same place my body wanted to shut down in Philadelphia.  This time it wasn't a lack of energy, it was a lack of training.  Maybe it was mental, but I was hurting.  For anyone else who deals with anxiety, you know how scary it can be when you can't catch your breath.  That is how I felt, and I was starting to feel like I wouldn't be able to catch it if I didn't stop.  I went through a battle here, and this exact experience is why I have fallen in love with running.  I ran the race in Philadelphia with friends, and for miles 3 - 13.1 I was side by side with one of my training partners.  I couldn't slow down in that race, we were in it together.  In this race though, I was alone.  I kept telling myself that I proved I could push through my body's alarm bells in Philadelphia, but this time it felt different.  


I made my way to the right side of the street to the yellow line and told myself that I had run a great race, and I could start walking.  I probably would still be able to finish under 2 hours as the 1:55 pacer was still in sight.  As I made it to the yellow line, I realized that I had now run about 30 seconds since I gave myself permission to quit.  And each step that I took was one more than I thought was possible.  I put my head down, stopped looking ahead, and focused on falling into each step.  Each step that I took was one step closer to being done.  3 miles to go, that's less than a 5k.  2.5 miles to go, that's less than my short loop of Central Park.  2 miles to go.  What's two miles?  I know I have that in me.  Settle in. 


I could feel myself starting to get very hot.  The temperature was cool, but the Florida sun had fully risen and was beating down on me.  I passed the 12-mile marker and told myself I was done drinking, I just needed this to be over.  The 1:55 pacer was still in sight, and as I approached the last aid station I struggled with my strategy.  Did I stop and walk a few feet as I had at the other aid stations or do I push through?  My strategy of stopping at aid stations had worked so far, so I stopped, grabbed a cup of water, and did my longest walk yet.  It was incredibly painful watching the 1:55 pacer pull away as I dumped the water over my head, but I knew that the 1:55 was somehow still possible since I had started behind them.  I put my head down, got on the yellow line, and started running.


Maybe it is in my head, but I am fully convinced that the final aid station is not at a half-mile marker.  I was timing my distance at this point by songs, and I timed my final push toward the pacer with what I thought was the very final stretch.  I passed the pacer as my second to last song finished, looked up, and the finish line was distantly in sight.  A little further than I had hoped, but not too bad.  Keep pushing.  Settle in.  As we began approaching what I thought was the finish, panic set in.  That's the start line.  Not the finish.  How much further would it be?  I was pushing a pace that was not sustainable.  I rounded the corner and could see, far in the distance, the actual finish line.  But I was slowing down.  I had expended what I thought was the last of my energy for this push, but I still had a more than insignificant distance to go.


This time, I didn't put my head down.  I stared at the finish line and the flags and knew that rest was almost here.  As I entered the final stretch (10 meters, 50 meters, 100 meters, I honestly don't know as this is a bit of a blur) I started sprinting toward the finish.  I crossed the line ahead of the 1:55 pacer, shattering what I thought was remotely possible for this race.


### Post-race
My mom and brother-in-law were waiting for me just after I crossed the line, and it was incredibly cool to share that experience and emotions with them.  I checked my watch.  13.26 miles, 1:54:38.  My mom has a very funny video of me continually saying that I wasn't sure what just happened with genuine shock on my face.  It all felt very surreal, and it honestly still does.  As we walked out, there was a booth for engraving your medal with your official time.  Given how well I had done, it felt very worth it.  It also provided a very cool way of learning my official time.  They handed my medal back with my name, and underneath it, 1:53:56.  A time that started with 1:53.


For more experienced or faster runners, this all may sound dramatic for what many likely consider a reasonably good time for a 30-year-old guy, but about 1.5 years ago, I was living a very unhealthy lifestyle and couldn't run a mile without stopping.  I had always told myself that maybe I could train for a 5k, but these long official races were just out of reach.  Those races are for other people.  And that's ok.  Completing both of these races has reminded me of just how much I am capable of, and that even when our minds are telling us to quit, we have so much more to give.


I'm now dealing with some pretty rough blisters and very sore muscles (flying the same day as a race is rough), but overall feeling on top of the world.  If you read all of this, I hope you found it interesting.  As I am finishing typing, I realize this exercise (no pun intended) was pretty therapeutic and something that I will likely look back on as I continue with this awesome sport.  Time for 19 days of rest before the next one!

### Training
What's good folks? Posting this under an alt account because my main has a lot of cringe capitalism content nobody needs to see. So, prior to this race the furthest I've run is a 10k. I did one of the ol Garmin watch plans, all of which went great! Missed a few runs so my furthest pre-race run was only 9 miles. I was a bit nervous about this but ""they"" told me if you can run 9 you can run 13 so I was trying to maintain some confidence going into this shitshow. 

### Pre-race
Traveling with my wife and 18-month old, we arrived in Vegas the day before the half and checked into Vdara. No massive complaints about the hotel, which was smoke-free and no gaming which is a crime as I was trying to rip heaters and play Pai Gow but thankfully the tables are easily accessible next door at Bellagio, Cosmo and Aria. Placed a few sportsbets and ate some dumplings at Din Tai Fung before crushing a couple $11 beers and getting to bed around 9.

Unfortunately for me, my daughter who sleeps like an angel at home decided she was not having it, leading to one of the worst nights sleep Ive had in ages. Woke up feeling like trash but told myself ""you've run tired before it's no big deal"" (foreshadowing). Honestly was not feeling good most of the day and was only able to eat a bowl of oatmeal and some juice. 

The thing about this damn race is it starts at 4:30pm, which is absurdly late for me. I went over and lined up around 3:30 and just stood around for 90 minutes feeling nervous and sort of not great. Eventually our group made it to the start and we were off!

### Race
Miles 1-3: Started at a slow 12m pace, hoping to kick it up to 11 in the middle portion. Around mile 2.5 I looked at my watch and saw my heart rate was about 20bpm more than normal. Not a good sign. 

Miles 4-6: Back along the main part of the strip. Great crowd energy and it was pretty fun as the sun started to set. Made sure not to look into the eye of the sphere as it's known that is how they get you.

Miles 7-9: After you pass the Strat you enter an absolute wasteland. Around mile 8 there was a table with a woman yelling ""free wine!"" and I'm absolutely certain she wasn't associated with the race. Shockingly didn't really see anyone taking her up on the free wine. The turn around was around this point where you turn onto the most unmaintained road in Nevada. Dodging potholes and glass was a fun added challenge.

Mile 10: As I passed the 10 mile marker I hit an absolute wall. Started cramping and feeling extremely ill. Thought I might puke but just slowed it down and started some walking. Really unusual feeling as I generally feel fantastic throughout my runs. I expect a combination of training, poor sleep and lack of food really fucked me here. Shout-out to the DJ who screamed in my ear to keep running outside the strip club with no name other than a sign that said ""strippers"".

Mile 11-13.1: This whole race I was looking forward to absolutely destroying a pint after but around this point I knew nothing else was going in my body this fine Sunday. Still feeling extremely ill I jog-walked towards the finish. I was in good company though as lots of folks seemed to be struggling at this point. Crossed the finish line and spent 10 minutes trying to escape to get back to my room. Grabbed the medal and a free banana and bounced.

### Post-race
Got back to my room and opened the banana, when the smell hit me I immediately vomited. 

Shaking like crazy I took a quick shower, climbed into bed and passed out.

### The next day

Woke up at 6am feeling fantastic and pretty happy I was able to finish. Overall while my time was extremely disappointing I'm happy to have finished and would run it again if I have the chance!

### Training
After finishing Couch to 5K, I kept up with running but missed the structure of a training programme. Having recently bought a shiny new watch, I started up the Garmin beginner half marathon plan with no real goal other than to build a stronger running base. A few weeks in I decided that if I was going to the effort of a 16-week training block I might as well have a race to complete at the end, so after searching around for a fairly small, fairly local race, I entered the Stockport Trail Half.

I had opted for the heart rate version of the Garmin plan, and my biggest hurdle early on was finding a pace I could hold while staying in Z2. I quickly realised that my previous training had been far too fast, so I had to spend a few weeks doing run-walk intervals for my easy runs to build up the low aerobic capacity.

My training week averaged 35km across 3 runs: easy or tempo; intervals; long run. I supplemented the runs with swimming and indoor cycling, each once or twice a week. The longest run session was 2 hours which took me up to 22km - a real confidence boost going into the race knowing I could do the distance. 

### Pre-race
In the two days prior to the race I focused on staying hydrated and stocking up on carbs. On race morning it was a 5.30am alarm, a very syrupy porridge breakfast, and then into the car for the 90 min drive to Stockport. I arrived early, which meant no queues for the porta-loos, but a good hour and a half standing around on a none-too-warm February morning. I did a short warm-up jog and some stretching before getting into my starting wave.

### Race
The race route sets out on a path along the decommissioned railway line towards Macclesfield, turning around at 10km and joining the canal towpath for the return leg. This meant it was very flat (only 40m total ascent), and although billed as a trail race, the dirt, gravel and cobble surfaces were very manageable in road shoes. 

Based on my training runs (where I ran a 48-min 10K, and 22km in 2:08), I'd set myself a pace plan for a 1:50 finish, with negative splits starting at 5:30/km and finishing at 4:54/km. The first 5km felt very easy, and I had to remind myself to stick to the plan while I watched most of my wave go past me within 10 mins of the start. My target splits only dropped by around 3s/km each time, so each increment felt manageable as I warmed up into the race. I brought four 20g carb gels with me, and started taking them at 20 min intervals from 5km onwards.

The 10km turnaround took me by surprise - if the marshal hadn't been standing in the path, I might have missed the turn entirely! I had planned to reassess at this point, and decide whether to continue aiming for 1:50 or adjust down to 1:55. The legs were still fine and my HR had stayed steady in the mid 160s (my Z3), so I was confident I could keep on with the 1:50 plan. I pushed on along the canal, overtaking where it was safe to do so. The wind was definitely a factor on the return leg, and more than once I took advantage of drafting behind another runner to save some energy.

The only real mistake of the race came where I misread my watch and thought I had completed 16km (note to self: ""kilometre 16"" means you've done 15, not 16!). I was feeling pretty good and decided to abandon the rest of the pace plan and treat the remaining ""5"" km like a 5K race. With that in mind, I also decided not to take on my final gel because it would slow me down. It took a couple of kms at around 4:50/km pace to realise my mistake, and by then I was committed so I just kept pushing, eventually getting my final kilometre down to 4:35 (only 6s off my actual 5K PB pace!)

I crossed the line for a chip timed finish of 1:48:xx, looking exhausted and ungainly (as confirmed by the finish photos), but more than a minute under my goal time for my first half marathon!

### Post-race
I definitely didn't stretch or cool down well enough after the race, but I did get possibly the best flapjack I've ever tasted along with my medal at the finish, so still a win in my book. I'm sore today, so plenty of foam rolling and a recovery swim or two before I get back to running again.

I can't get over how well the negative split plan worked. I felt strong throughout, and the psychological boost of passing other runners right up until the finish line can't be underestimated. Now having a baseline HM PB pace, I think I could start my splits slightly faster and do the whole race ""on-plan"", but as a first race based on a guesstimate finish time I'm pretty pleased.

It was a fantastic first HM experience (and first race in general), and I already have my eye on another HM later this year. For now, though, it's time to shave the legs and prepare the lycra for my first sprint triathlon in 12 weeks...

I only just got serious about running last year after having just done it every once in a while as a quick workout. I started out just running 3mi 3 days a week. After I selected a race, I got a Garmin because I like data and am horrible at pacing myself. I started with the Hansons beginner half plan. THAT was an error. I don't know if the mileage increase was too much but I started experiencing knee and IT band pain. I hit pause on that and started a 17 week training program on my Garmin, with a goal of 2:15. It was a 4 day a week plan.  I also incorporated strength training 2-3x a week.


I know reviews are mixed when it comes to the Garmin plans, but honestly I loved it. My watch yelled at me when I was too fast or too slow! Pacing was calculated for me based on a test run. It was great. Then I injured a muscle in my calf doing some unknown nonsense and had to take two weeks off. Not Ideal but I hopped right back in and continued on, generally feeling good during speed workouts and long runs. I didn't miss a day for the next 12 ish weeks.


Unfortunately, at the beginning of my taper, I re-injured my calf doing an excessive number of lunges during strength training. Took a week off. Went for an easy run to gauge my recovery. Stepped in a pothole because I run at night and the city is garbage. Twisted my ankle, thought it was ok, jogged home. NOT OK. I ended up wearing a brace for a while. I optimistically started carb-loading three days before just in case my ankle was ok in time. Did a nice easy run with the brace on Thursday to see if I would even be able to do the race. It went shockingly well! Ran a 30 min shake-out on Saturday, ate my face off, and went to bed later than I wanted.

### Pre-race


Woke up at 5:55 because that extra 5mins really made the difference. Had two gluten free toaster waffles (celiac), almond butter, honey, a banana, and an electrolyte drink that my MIL offloaded on me because it is disgusting. Raspberry salt. Blech.


Checked the weather: freezing, dressed, and did some foam rolling before heading to shirt pickup. I considered the 20ish min. walk my warmup and did some dynamic stretching once I got to the start. My photographer husband very enthusiastically brought his giant camera and took some pictures of me looking dumb swinging my legs around.


Got in the corral, freezing, and waited the 10 minutes for the race to start. Planning for an even split with 10ish min miles.

### Race


The first mile was a little nerve wracking because of my ankle, but the brace kept me toasty and stable. After mile 2 I realized my watch was off by maybe .15 miles, so I decided to pick up the pace a bit. Kept fueling every 3 miles. 


I don't know what happened at mile 5 but apparently I just wanted to book it. I realized I was feeling better than anticipated so I tried to maintain around a 9:30-9:40 pace for the next few miles, and aimed to pick it up around mile 11/12. Forget about that even split, apparently. 


Around mile 7 though, my legs got ROUGH. I had energy but they were just heavy and gross, so keeping pace was a struggle. I made it to 11 and figured either I go for it, or regret not doing the most I could, so I picked up the pace. At 12 it felt like I was booking it because it was uphill, but I was not. I went all out for the last 200 yards though. Started struggling to breathe - not ideal. Just could not pull in air, no idea what happened. New fun thing! But sprinted across the finish, grabbed a medal and heat blanket, couldn't figure out how to open the heat blanket, threw the heat blanket away. 


As you saw above, pacing consistency is not my thing.

### Post-race


My husband had miscalculated my mileage and had to sprint from the east side of the park, I was honestly very impressed with his time. He arrived just in time to see me cross the finish line and we met up so I could get into those toasty toasty sweats and have a protein shake and some electrolytes.


My legs died today. They felt like GARBAGE. Achy achy garbage. I chose to not sit down for fear of becoming one with the freezing ground. We walked over to Modern Bread and Bagel (shout out!) 15 blocks away. I honestly think this helped with my, admittedly ongoing, recovery. Ate a delicious bagel and latke tots and got a gosh darn bus home because like heck was I walking all the way across the park.


One hot shower, roll out session, and nap, later, and here I am. Refusing to get out of bed and messing around on reddit instead of being a productive member of society. Race recovery risotto for dinner!


Thanks for reading my nonsense y'all!

| 12 | 8:12
| 13 | 7:26
| 0.28 | 1:58 (picked up a little extra distance weaving around and whatnot)

### Training
Loosely followed a 12 week 4 day a week 2 hour half marathon plan but dropped one of the weekly short easy runs because I climb 3 days a week and I didn't want to give up a day of climbing to double up (running is more of a side thing). One short easy run, one interval/speed workout, one long slow run.

Longest run was 12 miles two weeks before the race.

### Pre-race
Was feeling nervous going into the race. I had some aches and pains starting to show up in my arches and ankles in the month leading up to the race and my last 12 mile training run was a grind for the last few miles (from general fatigue more than joint pain specifically, it was an unusually warm day that day). I also hadn't done a race this early (6am start, 4am wake up) so I wasnt sure exactly how that would affect my energy.

I was confident I'd finish but I wanted to go sub 2 which would require running faster than all my training runs.

### Race
Got up at 4am, had coffee, a PBJ and some electrolytes. Got things moving, made it to the race venue nice and early, used the restroom again and headed to the corral with plenty of time to question my life choices.

This was my first half and my first race with pacers so it was a new experience to have such a visible and immediate source of feedback on pace. My plan was just to stick with the 2 hour pacer and see what happened. I quite enjoyed not having to constantly check my watch to make sure I was on pace, shout out to those guys (and gals and nonbinary pals)

A nice dark cool start for the first hour before the sun came up. Despite going before heading to the staring line I had to pee again and peeled off around mile 4 to hit the portajohn. Found my pacer again and got back on track (definitely worth the time penalty). 

You come out of a residential area onto the waterfront around mile 5 or 6 and it's beautiful to run by the bay as the sun is rising. Thankfully the temperatures stayed mild even once the sun made it's entrance. 

Usually in my training runs  I'd start to crap out around mile 9 but I was feeling great by this point in the race so I decided to open up on the pace since it seemed like I might have a shot to finish in 2 hours per the overall race clock rather than just my chip time. Things felt great all the way up to the finish line where I finished with the clock at 2:00:20 and my chip time at 1:56:29

Somehow I managed to PR my 10k, 5k, and mile times during the race. I'm still relatively new to running so I don't have a ton of races under my belt and only raced one 10k and 5k each during my lead up to this so there was definitely room to improve on those times but I'm still very happy with how it turned out. I don't think it could have gone any better.


### Post-race
Great race, great course, great times. Will celebrate with beer and other recreational goods and hopefully a nap (not necessarily in that order). 

A marathon is probably not in my future at least for the foreseeable time horizon. My goal is to do a couple fun runs in the next month or two (there's a 10k that goes across one of Tampa bays bridges as well as a mud race that I have my eyes on) and then just try to hold onto as much progress I can when the 1-2 punch of brutal heat and daily rain comes in the summertime. Once fall starts to roll back around maybe we'll think about another half.

1016,1708800889.0,"Ladies, is it ok for a guy to use you as a pacer?","I ran a half marathon this morning at a US Roadrunners event. Most people run the 5k or 10k and the HM crowd is usually very small. Today, apparently there were 10 people running it. It’s a little out and back course that requires 4 laps to hit 13.1 miles. I didn’t have any real goal in mind this morning, I just wanted to run and get an idea of where I’m at after a few months of interupted running. Long story short, when the race started, I quickly progressed to the front of the pack and there were only a few people in front of me. The HM turnaround is a little after the 5/10k so I found out that the lady in front of me was also running the HM. She had set a solid pace and I ended up using her to push myself. I basically tailed her the whole race, leaving a 10-20 meter gap between us. As we neared the finish line on the last lap, I caught up and finished right on her heels. I wanted to finish strong but I didn’t want to pass her since she had set the pace the entire run. 

When we finished, we congregated each other and chatted for a bit. She told me that knowing I was keeping up with her had pushed her to keep up the pace and she was really thankful. I told her that she was the one forcing me to push, not the other way around. Haha. So it was a great run but the whole time, I was thinking about an Instagram post I saw a professional female runner post. In a nutshell, she told guys that she (and other women) aren’t personal pacers and being a female and having a guy following you can be uncomfortable. I understand that as much as I can being a guy and that was why I tried to keep a gap between me and the lady setting the pace. 

So my question is, for the female runners out there, would you have felt uncomfortable if you were the woman at the race this morning? I’m thinking it’s maybe different in a race setting than if we were just out running casually somewhere. I’m curious as to people’s thoughts because I have no interest in making a fellow runner uncomfortable and while the lady this morning was thankful for me helping her to keep the pace, I didn’t know that until after we finished.

*Edit: just for clarity, the instagram runner I’m referring to was talking about being used as a pacer on a training run, not in a race which I think is very different and totally understandable. As the “race” I ran was just a monthly US Roadrunner event and not an official race, I thought the question was worth asking. If it was an official race, I think it’s totally fine but as it was just a small (less than 200 people) event and the results were meaningless, I thought I’d ask. I’ve always run solo so these monthly events are the only times I’ve run with other people and yesterday was the first time I’ve used another runner to push myself.",running
1017,1708805246.0,How to be kinder to yourself as a beginner runner?,"Hey all, I just started running like 3 months ago. I think I’ve been progressing as I can run longer distances without my form breaking down as much, or having better energy for longer distance runs, but having said that, I feel like I’m too harsh on myself. When I see my stats on Strava after a long run, I’ll often say to myself in my head “you’re such a loser”, “such an idiot, people out there doing marathons and 9min mile”, “but you can’t even do something simple”, like I will constantly berate myself even tho I would never say this to someone else who’s new to running. Wondering how to be kinder to myself and not be obsessed with noticeable progress in every run. 



Edit: thanks for the supportive comments. Just some context, I’ve never been a runner. Was very average at gym class, never great. Also, I feel like no one in my family, or in my family’s history has been athletic, and it doesn’t help that I’m from a gene pool that’s generally stereotyped as being non-athletic by most of the world. So I take my failures hard, and wonder if I should just quit all the time ",running
1019,1708707320.0,Running a race with a friend,"I need advice!

I signed up to run the Disney Princess Half Marathon with one of my best friends. She is super into the Disney races, and this will be her 10th year doing it. This is my 3rd half-marathon. 

I'm a faster runner than her, but she had mentioned she wanted PR this year to complete one of her 30-before-30 goals (we're 29 years old). I was excited about this, and I have been training.

She is very set on running races TOGETHER, the entire time. Every race we've done together we cross the finish line holding hands. It's fun and very bonding, but she slows me down. It can be frustrating considering how much these races cost and how the Disney races don't come around that often. 

I have been friends with her for over 10 years, and I know in the past a friend ""took off on her"" and she held resentment towards this other girl for it, for years. 

The race is two days away- and she communicated with me that she has an ankle injury. She no longer thinks WE can ""run run"" this race. She will probably want to walk a lot more than I will. 

Should I tell her I want to run at my own pace? We're having a sleepover and dressing up for this so I'm concerned she's going to react very poorly to this suggestion.

Background

I am 18 male and weigh around 175 lbs. I ran cross country and track all 4 years of high school, ending with mediocre PR's of 18:45 for the 5k and 5:05 in the mile. Unfortunately, due to living in a rural area, my cross country and track coach was the JV girls' basketball coach who had no knowledge about the sport at all. Due to this in cross country season my training consisted of essentially running 3 miles hard Monday through Friday. Training for track wasn't much different as she had me doing either 2-mile repeats or 400-meter repeats five days a week. My highest mileage week was 15 miles. As you can probably tell this led to a very injury riddled career. After graduating high school, I met some of the cross-country runners at my college. When they heard about my training in high school, they encouraged me to start running again and see if I improve with proper training.

Training

As soon as winter break started, I decided to take their advice and started my training, running a solo mile time trial in 6:13. I took two weeks just to get myself into decent shape, and started up a plan I found on the internet on January 1st. This plan had me running 3-4 miles at an easy pace 4 days a week, with 2 workouts, and a long run on Sundays. This made running so much more fun that in high school and I started to actually enjoy running. About 3 weeks in, the plan had me run a time trial 800, which I finished in 2:39. 2 weeks later, I did a 1200 time trial which was completed in 4:08. 2 days later, I ran possibly my best workout ever: 8 x 400 with 2 minutes rest in 77-75-75-73-73-74-79-81. This really boosted my confidence, because I never got close to these splits in high school. I ended up running around 30 miles a week the last month of training, and never got an injury or even felt close to one!! You can see all my training at my Strava: https://www.strava.com/athletes/116210504/training/log

Pre-race

I slept great the day before the race and got a fitful 8 hours. I made sure to drink a good amount of water throughout the day especially because this was the first day of 75+ degrees this year. I stretched and warmed up with an easy mile beforehand.

Race

At around 8:30 I started my race alone. I felt good after one lap and split a 75. In laps 2 and 3 I felt as if I kept the same pace from lap 1, but I was really struggling. I split 84 and 83 for these laps respectively Lap 4 I just went all out finishing with an 80 final split and a 5:22.

Post-race/Next Steps

In retrospect I probably took it out too fast trying to break my PR, (which by the way had a 69 first split lol) and then really couldn't hold on especially because I was alone and not in an actual race. I still do think I could run close to sub 5:00 in a real race considering I am very competitive and have a history of running much better with competition. Unfortunately, there's not much of a running community near me and there are virtually no races at all, much less just a 1-mile race. I don't really know where to go from here as my friends on my college's team run 4:20-4:30, and my college doesn't have a club team that could help me get into an actual race. I do think I need to get better at longer distances, as the paces that I should be able to run a tempo at are all out efforts and I can't run 1 mile at what I should be able to run an all out 5k at. Maybe I'll do that, but I'm very much open to tips or advice on what I should do.",running

This carb recipe is what I use. It's pretty much an exact replica of Maurten 320. Someone smarter than me designed it so I feel fine with it. If you desire a hydrogel type drink, then just mix 80g of it with 500ml of water and you will have Maurten 320. The hydrogel is backed by science, Joshua Rowe prior to his employment at Maurten tested this idea in a study and did prove its effectiveness. Other companies have claims against this actually having any improvement in carb uptake. I figure it can't hurt, so I include the gelling components. Additionally, I use this same base as a gel. So one carb mix allows me to decide what I want to use depending on the application/workout. I use a maltodextrin and fructose blend, because the maltodextrin isn't very sweet. Its palatable without being overly sweet. If you want to be even more cost effective, use straight up table sugar. It's a 1:1 ratio, versus a 1:0.8, so it would perform almost identically. You can also go 2:1 if you want even less sweetness by having a reduced fructose amount. Maltodextrin is super cheap so that could be a way you to stretch your fructose longer if desired. I don't include electrolytes, but if you want you can. The electrolyte recipe further down this post can definitely be added to this if you like it combined. I do not add any flavoring, but if you want you can add whatever you like.

The recipe:

Single Maurten 320

* 48g Maltodextrin
* 32g Fructose
* 1.25g Pectin
* 1g Sodium Alginate

Below is the recipe of Maurten 320 scaled up 10x. Feel free to adjust quantities to fit your needs. I like a 10x batch in a big zip lock to use as needed. If you want, you can even do 20x, etc.

10x Maurten 320

* 480g Maltodextrin
* 320g Fructose
* 12.5g Pectin
* 10g Sodium Alginate

When making a gel, take your total desired volume and use 60% carbs + 40% water. Add boiling water and it will dissolve fairly quickly. Maltodextrin takes the longest. The consistency is thick enough that it doesn't shoot out of your preferred pouch uncontrollably but also is easy enough to drink & swallow. For the 150ml pouches I do 120g carbs + 80g water in a bowl. Mix with a hand mixer and then dump into a pouch. Filled to the fill line results in about 105g of carbs per pouch, so two pouches could easily fuel an entire marathon. Typically, I use these [reusable children's food pouches](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Modern-Reusable-Food-Pouches/dp/B08SRSWFY6/ref=sr\_1\_1?crid=37J2J5RL9Y5RJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.bTt4-fkUYWw7NM9Y8YVRco2EdvSKDBbGhQ1UkSwF8Bb9rnevEz02y6zY0RGA8au35PRJCLcSX6wUW9rrA-3qwHhbb5GPNLKe6LGParjW6p-KkaAp\_vsmuF8PhDyEuEd3S8qWdTQaadhpigY721Pdyk\_-SG2xtZLvAqFIl13xqGyCa7yyePtDqxJhQPRp8hakwZOEv5PQfWg53qaoIrapnna6PMWVK1J5XiJDxVDTexHr4ouALl\_1htt4gwUOYWYIdili4KK0yCb7Oz7qCI36fPcyPYGSSoXHN2E9wSPaNAI.o2RowZ4o9FZBcSdUjh4VSw-ylCG9wd5N4j2Klc1Rld0&dib\_tag=se&keywords=baby+food+pouches+refillable&qid=1708644403&sprefix=baby+food+poucn%2Caps%2C341&sr=8-1-spons&sp\_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Modern-Reusable-Food-Pouches/dp/B08SRSWFY6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=37J2J5RL9Y5RJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.bTt4-fkUYWw7NM9Y8YVRco2EdvSKDBbGhQ1UkSwF8Bb9rnevEz02y6zY0RGA8au35PRJCLcSX6wUW9rrA-3qwHhbb5GPNLKe6LGParjW6p-KkaAp_vsmuF8PhDyEuEd3S8qWdTQaadhpigY721Pdyk_-SG2xtZLvAqFIl13xqGyCa7yyePtDqxJhQPRp8hakwZOEv5PQfWg53qaoIrapnna6PMWVK1J5XiJDxVDTexHr4ouALl_1htt4gwUOYWYIdili4KK0yCb7Oz7qCI36fPcyPYGSSoXHN2E9wSPaNAI.o2RowZ4o9FZBcSdUjh4VSw-ylCG9wd5N4j2Klc1Rld0&dib_tag=se&keywords=baby+food+pouches+refillable&qid=1708644403&sprefix=baby+food+poucn%2Caps%2C341&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1)) as they are environmentally friendly, fit my half tights easily, and are dishwasher safe.

&#x200B;

**Electrolytes**

I straight up copied this from Toyman on TrainerRoad. It was easy and cheap enough and has worked well. I suffer from migraines, dehydration being a trigger. I do drink a lot of water every day and typically avoid high salt foods. I have absolutely noticed that this mixture has helped me stay hydrated better and has improved that aspect of my personal life, outside of running. I typically start my day with 16oz of water and 1-1.5g of this. Again, I don't add anything for flavor. You could add lemon juice, citric acid, or flavoring if you want. It's easy enough to drink that it does not bother me. Sodium citrate is much more palatable, so it's almost flavorless to me. There is some evidence regarding improvement in uptake of electrolytes in the presence of carbohydrates. I will often add 10-20 grams of table sugar if I am not consuming any other carbs when taking electrolytes. The below recipe is easily about 100 servings, so it stretches easily.

The recipe:

* 25g MgS04 (magnesium sulfate/epsom salt)
* 8g calcium carbonate
* 80g Morton lite salt
* 367g sodium citrate (hydrated)

You should achieve per 1/2 teaspoon (roughly 3g):

* 1000mg sodium
* 200mg potassium
* 50 mg calcium
* 50 mg magnesium

Note: these ingredients mix well besides the Epsom salt. I put some on a Ziploc bag and used a hammer to smash it into a powder. That way it wouldn't fall to the bottom of the bag and blended better with the mixture.

&#x200B;

**Recovery (Post Run)**

After looking into the recovery drinks, they are pretty simple. With the above recipes you pretty much already have what you need besides the protein. Tailwind Recovery is like $40 and that gets you 15 servings! Skratch isn't much different. Bulk Supplements has whey isolate and casein protein on amazon for pretty cheap. Whey isolate is fast absorbing, casein is slower. I don't know what is better, so I use both. Choose whatever you want here. The post run recovery drinks tend to do a 4:1 carb to protein mixture, which makes the price seem even more outrageous. There must be some science behind that ratio, so use it if you like. That is very little protein, which means your bulk protein powder will last even longer. I use a bit more. For the carbs you can use your carb mix. I prefer table sugar. My above carb mix is only for my gels. I am not as concerned with the post run carb source. Additionally, you could add in something like rice flour to this if you wanted a bit more of a ""whole food"" carb source. Also, feel free to adjust the desired carbs based on how hard your workout was. I am just simply looking for a quick drink to get some nutrition post run. After my shower, getting the kids up and ready, before I head off to work, I do eat a decent balanced breakfast. This just gives my body something to help with recovery. Again, not much for flavor here. I am not picky. Feel free to add what you want (chocolate sauce, vanilla extract, caramel sauce, orange juice, milk, etc.).

I have been doing the following with fine success.

* 1.5g Electrolytes
* 20g - 40g table sugar (based on workout)
* 10g Whey isolate
* 10g Casein
* A few dashes of cinnamon for flavor

&#x200B;

**Future Bonus**

I am currently working on a copycat Maurten 225 Solid bar recipe. Essentially, it's just Rice Krispy cereal, oatmeal, rice flour, and some simple syrup. I haven't nailed the ratios just yet, but when I do, I will update this post as well as probably create a new post. I find this is great to eat before a long run or with my post run breakfast for more carbs after a hard run.

Credit: Jim Downing, Dr. Alex Harrison, Toyman, and I'm sure many others that I gleaned information from as I copied and modified some of these recipes from Reddit, YouTube, and TrainerRoad.

1038,1708552588.0,"Race Report: Austin Marathon- well, jog report","I originally signed up for the Austin Marathon sometime mid-summer after a pretty frustrating 2023 (both weather related- I don't do well in hot!). Originally, I was going to make Austin my a-race and find something else fun to do a little later in the season, but pretty soon after signing up, my church announced a  fundraiser event for the San Antonio ""Run the Alamo"" marathon, which is 2 weeks after Austin. So I signed up for that because I'm not smart, and decided to just run Austin as a no-pressure glorified long run.

**Pre-Race**

A cool front blew into the central Texas area Friday evening, bringing morning temps down to the mid-to-high 30s. I live about an 90 minutes away from Austin, but they don't do race-day packet pick up, so I decided to  grab a hotel for Saturday night. I drove up Saturday afternoon, did packet pick up and hit the expo for a bit, before going for a nice easy jog around town lake. Had a pretty light dinner, and went to bed at around 10PM. 

Race day morning was a breakfast of PB toast, a granola bar, a couple of hard-boiled eggs banana, and a cup of coffee. I ate breakfast, did my business, took a shower and headed out by 6AM to make the 7AM start. Weather was absolutely perfect racing weather... just shy of 40F at the starting line, and it stayed pretty cool the whole time. When I finished, I think it was probably mid 50s.

Anyways, Austin has a mass single corral start, so about 6:45, I started wading through the sea of people to try and get around the 4hr crowd. There were a TON of people there. Seriously, it was pretty cramped. Not unexpected, and not a bad thing for me, though. It took us about 5 minutes to get across the starting line after the official start.

**Miles 1-6**

I ran this race about 10 years ago, but they completely changed the course since then. The course now takes you out on about a 6 or 7 mile out-and-back (kindof) along South Congress and South 1st. There were a TON of people out, and it was a pretty good way to start the race. The first 3 miles or so out were rolling hills with a net climb, before turning around and heading back down towards town on South 1st. I went into this race with the goal of just enjoying it and not overdoing anything.  I think I split like 9:15, 9, and 8:45 on the way out, and settled in around 8:20s for most of the rest of the course.

Oh, couple quick thoughts here too. The bib safety pins they provided were absolute garbage. I had to stop 3 times in the first mile to reattach one top pin that kept coming loose before I finally just swapped it out for a bottom pin. Also, as is tradition at this point, I had to pee immediately after I cross the starting line, but I kept being on the wrong side of the street every time we passed restrooms, and the crowd was packed way too dense for me to dart through. I think I finally was able to make it to the bathroom around mile 9.

**Miles 7-9**

This was my favorite short-section of the course, by far. As soon as you cross the lake back into downtown, you were greeted by just masses of people out cheering. Seriously, it felt more like the finish line than the actual finish line of some races. I made a point of taking it all in. At one point, someone somehow (like, how tf does this happen) had lost their shirt and bib, and decided it was a good idea to run against the flow of the crowd to go back and look for it. He crashed head-long into the lady who was running next to me, but she stayed on her feet and was fine-thankfully.  That guy was an idiot- don't be that guy.

**Miles 10-13**

The course loops you out west of town through a few historic neighborhoods up to Oyster Landing, before turning you back east, directly into the rising sun (blinding!), towards downtown. There were a few rolling hills, along with a pretty steep but short climb as you ran under Mopac. The half-marathoners split off at mile 12, to head toward the finish line back on Congress, while the marathoners headed north out towards UT's campus. This stretch of the course was quiet, but was pretty and enjoyable. I'm not used to running with half-marathoners so long, but keeping everyone on the same course through mile 12 or so meant it was a dense field of runners. There was still room to maneuver, but I was glad to not be running with any goals in mind. I think I had caught up with the 3:50 pace group in this section by mile 11 or so, and decided to settle in just ahead of them.

**Miles 14-18**

Campus, finally- HOOK-EM! The course takes you along the drag and up through Hyde Park before turning you back around towards campus on the east side. I was expecting things to open up a bit here, but I was surprised to still feel like everyone was packed in pretty tight. Things finally seemed to space out around mile 17 or 18. Again- tons of people out cheering. I enjoyed every minute of this section of the course, and stayed tucked in with the 3:50 folks. My plan was to get to mile 20, and make a decision about how to run the last 6 miles without overdoing it.

**Miles 19-25**

East Austin! All of this was new to me. There were so many new neighborhoods, shops, restaurants that I'd never seen before or heard of. I won't comment on whether that's good or bad, but it made for a pretty entertaining section of the course. They zig-zag you all the way down to about Pleasant Valley and Cesar Chavez, before turning west towards downtown. Again, SO many people out cheering. There was a bit of downhill for the first few miles of this section, which was nice. I was feeling strong until about mile 23, when the fatigue from some of the earlier hills caught up to me a bit. It was so nice to be able to just back off a bit and enjoy the rest of the race. I walked a few water stations here, and clocked a 9, 10, and 9:15. It was great, lol.

**Mile 26**

The last little section sends you under I35 and up 6th Street a little bit, before doing one final little stretch north toward the Capitol, up a horrible little hill to your left, and then one more left before running downhill to the finish line. I have lots of respect for the people who muscled their way up that hill at 26, but I definitely walked it. That thing would have been brutal if you had a time goal that was coming down to the wire. I got up the hill, and jogged it on in for a comfortable 3:52. 

**Post-Race**

I met up with my wife and kid, and some of the in-laws after the race, then grabbed a hotel shower and checked out before getting some margs and tacos. Felt fatigued and a little tired afterwards, but overall I feel like I did a pretty good job of keeping it easy. Took Monday off, and went on a short run yesterday to keep the legs moving some.

1041,1708500327.0,"Running shoe ""recovery"" concensus","TLDR: **Is resting the foam in your shoes good for increasing total mileage of each individual shoe?**

I wanted to post this type of thread again with [this article in the OP](https://runrepeat.com/uk/guides/running-shoe-foams-guide). I'm not saying this is definitive, the citation is just described as ""a chart made by Dow"". 

> In this chart created by the American-based company Dow to showcase the advantages of its EVA + OBC compound, various foams undergo static compression at room temperature for 22 hours. Afterward, they’re set for recovery during 24 hours. If a foam manages to return to its original shape...

> To err on the side of caution, establish a rotation of 2 or 3 pairs of shoes and wait at least 48 hours before using the same model again. And as happens with you, the longer and faster you run, the more rest your shoes will need to recover. By doing so, you'll not only enjoy better leg protection and bounciness, but you'll also extend the lifespan of the shoe by allowing it to fully recover between workouts.

> (Ctrl + F ""Let your shoes rest and recover"" to find this section in the link)

I've seen this question asked a few times, here is the summary of various threads:

- this is not a thing. This answer gets the most upvotes on threads of this topic
- some people say they do rotate, and seem to get more life
- about an equal number of anecdotal comments say the opposite (same life)

I want to preclude ""get shoes for different types of runs"" and ""slightly different shoes may help prevent injury by training different muscles"" discussions to focus on the *foam recovery* phenomenon.

I'm one month in and already have 3 shoes even though all I ever do at this stage of running is ""easy days"", so the facts aren't all that important to me. I'm keeping these shoes regardless lol I just am curious",running

1056,1708373241.0,Seville Marathon Race Report,"

Training

This was my first Marathon having run some half marathons in 2023 and a 70.3 triathlon in October. Whilst I enjoyed my training for those events I have to admit I did not ever take the run training seriously, mostly completing an easy 6km loop near my house a couple of times a week however I didn’t really have any issue and completed those events happily. 

Ahead of running my first Marathon I wanted something more structured and largely used the TrainAsONE platform to plan my training. 

Largely this was fine and I enjoyed my introduction to structured training that I could shuffle around as I needed it too. I ran a conservative benchmarking half marathon at the end of November and finished that in 1:34 which gave me a rough goal of 3:15. 

Training largely went well however I got unwell for 2 weeks in January whilst my mileage ramped up and so I peaked at 55km for this and managed a long run of 25km and 31km with MP efforts included in both.  I usually cross trained twice a week on the bike for around two hours per week. 


Pre-race

Tapering was eventful as following my longest run I came down with yet another illness and the following weeks running volume was 3km… However, I felt in great shape coming to Seville and felt pretty prepared. 

Race


Standing on the start line I impulsively decided to set out for 3:20 rather than my initial goal of 3:15 and settled into a rhythm based on that. 

The first 22km rolled by uneventfully as I ticked of the kilometres, took a gel every 5k and an electrolyte tablet at every 10km marker. Every split here was between 4:39 and 4:42 per km and I honestly felt like I could have ran all day. This was easy, this was conversational, my body felt fantastic and I could already looking forward to a beer after finishing!

Unfortunately this is where it all goes wrong. 

Coming around a corner I rolled my ankle in what I think was a pothole / cobble (I have absolutely no idea). I managed to keep running for another 7km however I had to adjust my stride to take some pressure of my ankle and this meant my knee flared up in the process. By the 30km mark I was limping and could barely put any weight on my leg. 

I limped the rest of the course with some jogging where I could. I really didn’t want to DNF my first marathon but it probably would have been wiser to drop out. On the plus side it gave my some time to appreciate this fantastic city as the final 10km goes through the centre of Seville. 


Post-race

I’m not going to lie, Immediately post-race I was absolutely devastated but after sleeping on it I appreciate that it’s just one of those things and I should have been watching the road more carefully. 

Frustratingly If I had simply not had the fitness I could have dealt with that but to have such a great time of it before the incident makes it hard to take. 

Nevertheless I have gone from struggling to run 5km last January to completing my first marathon in what is a great time. 

Thanks for reading - I would definitely recommend Seville for those looking for an early year Marathon.",running

I have Vuori joggers, but they need constant adjustment over longer distances (were fine for a half marathon). I just ordered Brooks shakeout pants to try. Any other ideas?

I really like the idea of a jacket with a chest pocket for my phone. I have a special harness for running my dogs, so having a chest pocket or upper pocket is a big selling point.

From what I’ve gathered, it looks like the Atom Hoody, Squamish Hoody, and Proton Lightweight have that. Do any of you own either of these jackets or have before? Do you like them or dislike them? Are there any other Arc’teryx jackets you’d recommend? My budget is right around $300.

\### Training

I'd long been a runner of a certain type: 5km three times a week or so, pushing it every time, and wondering why any distance over that felt impossible. Last year I discovered the joy and power of running easy, and the vista of longer distances opened up. 

I'd never thought of running a race, however,  let alone a marathon. Oddly, the impetus for this one came from a holiday in Italy in September '23. Encouraged by a packed itinerary of churches and museums, my wife and I ended up clocking an absurd average of 30k steps a day. I actually lost weight, despite pastas and gelattos aplenty. And I ended up feeling pretty fit, when I hadn't expected to, exactly five months before the Peninsula Marathon, a straight-out race from near where I live on the west side of Cape Town through to Simonstown on the east coast of the Cape peninsula. 

I asked my brother, a natural runner who had also never run further than 12km or so, whether he might want to join me. He said he'd be delighted, and we both kicked off with Hal Higdon's Novice 2 programme.      

We locked into the programme quickly and happily. Every new long run felt like an accomplishment, but  very manageable. Neither of us suffered any injuries or disruptions. I missed two or three short runs for various reasons, my brother managed every run. It was a joyful experience – first having the lungs open up, then the legs getting stronger, and finally, in the last two months, best of all, having my easy pace increase steadily so I could run, not jog, up to 20 km or so without strain. I'm not a great runner, and I'm 42, but along the way I set PBs of 23 minutes for 5km, 51 minutes for 10km, and under 2 hours for 21km. 

Everything felt manageable, we both felt great, and while we'd both been clear on our goals for this first race – to have fun, soak up the experience, and finish together – a part of me thought that in the next race I could probably think about a personal goal of somewhere around 4 hours.

The hubris!        
\### Pre-race  
Entering the taper, my brother and I laughed about what I had read about 'taper tantrums' and 'maranoia'. So when, exactly one week before the race, I got a tickle in my throat, I chalked it up to psychosomatics. But it quickly became clear it was legitimately somatic. Full-body aches, sweats, a cough ... I made two resolutions: a) i would make the final decision on whether or not to race the day before the race, not before, and b) I wasn't going to let pride dictate whether I raced – I come from a medical family, and I know well the dangers of overexertion on a sick-taxed body. After a committed hydration, rest, ginger and fruit regimen, three days before the race I woke up feeling I'd turned the corner. Two days before I was at 95%, and the day before I felt great. I'd never recorded a fever during the sickness, so I was happy to make the call: we were on. Let the empastafication commence 🍝!     
\### Race  
The race takes place in the middle of summer, so it begins early, at 5.15am. We got there in the dark and joined a queue, which we soon realised was for the toilets ... there were not many given the 4000ish runners assembled. We left the queue and milled around, and then both decided we should actually piss. This led to the first odd event of the day. By the time we'd gotten to the toilets the gun had gone off. We weren't too bothered, the timing was mat to mat, but we did end up being amongst the last handful of people to set off, five minutes or so after race start. This turned out to be pleasant in a way; running through the city more or less alone, and gradually catching up the the rest of the pack; starting at the back meant that we were overtaking people consistently for half the race, which was good for morale. 

But let me be clear: my sickness that week had reinforced our plans to take it super easy. We approached the race like an easy training long run. We'd jog the first 16km, and then take it from there. We weren't out to pass people for the sake of it. 

But we were both feeling great! Lungs were good, energy was good, the marshals and police were wonderfully warm and encouraging, people were starting to come out of their homes to cheer us on. It was such a cool way to see our city. Coming around the mountain below Newlands the skyline opens up, the cool smell of oaks and grass kits you, and everything felt A-OK. 

The only niggle, from about 10km in, was a slight pain in the tendon (ligament?) below my right kneecap. This was odd – I'd never felt any localised leg pain in training – and exacerbated slightly by the fact that the road hadn't been completely closed off, which meant that we were running in the left-hand lane the whole way, and this meant a consistent camber, which, after a while, began to grate. 

When we took stock at 21km, though, we were both still enjoying ourselves thoroughly. It felt as though we were comfortably in the middle of the pack, we were running at what felt like the perfect pace, well within our comfort zones. The weather was perfect, the infamous cape winds had taken a day off. 

Then everything began to go wrong. My knee just got more and more painful. I stopped and flexed it a few times, but couldn't find a stretch that targeted it. If it had been a pain that indicated injury or impending injury I would have thought about stopping, but it didn't seem to. I don't know why I was convinced of that, but I was. It was just a dull tightness that every so often would flare up into heat and unpleasantness. I'm not averse to pain and I decided to embrace it as a fellow traveler. I was still feeling positive, and we just slowed down a bit. But it got worse.

At around 30km you leave the inland suburbs, emerge at Muizenberg, and the *raison d'être* of the race lies ahead of you: 12km of the most beautiful coastal road, flat, with the Kalk Bay mountains to your right and the False Bay ocean to your left. This is a section we'd run several times in our training. It's always the part of the run I'd most looked forward to. In my mind we would have paced ourselves correctly by this point, and if, in fact, we had a bit of pep, this would be the time to engage it, to stretch the legs, feel the wind on our faces, smile at one another and the view and our fellow marathoners and enjoy a bit of a push to the finish. 

Instead I could barely run. I had to start taking walk breaks. It was heartbreaking. And the pain kept increasing. Soon the walk breaks turned into run breaks between walks. From 32km until the finish we walked more than we ran. Then even walking was difficult. If my brother hadn't been there I might have given up, but that became my goal; not running a marathon, not setting a goal time, but simply walking, putting one foot in front of the other, for 8, 6, 4, 2 more kilometres. 

Pitiful! I felt like crying. I felt humiliated. I also felt ... heroic? It was genuinely difficult what I did! It required a great deal of will not to stop, to keep pushing through the pain. I gave it all I could have. Over the course of the day my race ambitions had changed from running my first marathon in a creditable time, to managing to run a few hobbled steps over the finish line. Who would have guessed? Pathetic.    

  
\### Post-race  
Our partners were both traveling so we caught one of the race buses back to the start. The bus ride was absolutely interminable through the traffic and the heat of the day. We all smelt riotous. The group next to us were absurdly experienced runners – two of them had run close to 200 marathons, one had run a marathon in another province the previous day! It was unreal to hear their stories. Everyone has their own goals, and few runners are completely satisfied with their performance, whatever that might have been. 

My legs are stiff but no lasting damage has been done. Before this race I was pretty sure that my first marathon would not be my last. After that suffer-fest I'm I bit more wary. The half marathon distance seems a lot more reasonable, and I think I'll aim for one of those as a next goal. Overall I'm exceptionally glad to have gone through four months of training, to be fitter than I probably ever have been, to have shared that experience with my brother, and to have pushed to get across the line. I'm also completely humbled and ashamed, and full of respect for y'all and your madness. Cheers.

### Training
Read the 80/20 book and followed the Level 2 marathon training plan. I only did ~65% of the runs, but I did do most of the long runs. I did miss about 3 weeks of training right before the taper phase because I got sick, then the weather turned freezing and I didn’t want to risk getting sick again, and then I went on a liquid fast for church. So I almost felt like I had to get back into gear with the taper phase.

### Pre-race
Ate a bowl of oatmeal and sipped some coffee in the morning. Parking was crazy so I barely managed to get in place for the race 3 min before it began. I was near the 4:50 pacer and I was aiming to stick with her as long as I could. It was mega cold and I was shivering. Very thankful I brought a head warmer and gloves. I had to pee so bad.

### Race
4:50 pacer just took off lol. Never saw her again. Mile 5, I took a 7 min break at a long line for portapotties and regretted not going to the earlier ones. First 13 miles were a breeze, which is crazy because I did my first half marathon only the year before. It’s crazy how much marathon training and cranking out 12+ miles on the regular can shift your perspective on previously hard things. 

Crowds definitely thinned out during miles 13-20, and it got cold again without all the bodies. Momentum-wise, I felt a bit slower without all the runners and fatigue starting to kick in more. Definitely started feeling some foot pain during this time but it was very bearable and these miles were a bit of a blur. 

Mile 20-21 is when the foot pain really hit me. Every step hurt. Then my hamstrings started hurting with each step, then my hips. Not serious issues, but it was definitely painful. I started to walk every time I went to a hydration station. I had to let loose battle cries every time I started running again.

Miles 22-26 were a battle. Every time I saw a mile marker, I was so happy. Each volunteer at the hydration stations had the face of an angel. I started thinking about why humans make up unnecessary obstacles to overcome, and why I chose to be a part of it. 

Giant hill right before mile 26. That was one big F-U to marathon runners lol. Sprinted as best as I could the last 0.2 miles.

### Post-race
I actually felt pretty good right after the race. I thought I would be limping across the finish line, but I was able to walk like a normal person for the most part. My limiting factors were definitely more about my feet pain than anything else. Heart-wise and energy-wise, I felt pretty good. Soreness gradually set in as the endorphins wore off. Then I started walking like a newborn giraffe.

I took a chair with me into the shower. It was wonderful.

Now I am a potato.

Overall, despite the hardship, all the pain past, present, and future, the marathon was truly a fun and transformative experience and I’m amazed that I was even able to do this. One thing I hope to take away from this is that I am capable of so much more than I think, and I want to be able to apply that to other parts of my life. Thanks running for the journey you’ve taken me on :)

# My last race report (San Antonio RnR half)

# Training

So literally my first run after my last half after taking two days off I pulled my hamstring and had to take a week and a half off, so training didn’t get off to the greatest start.

I didn’t follow any specific plan, again, I just created my own plan of increasing mileage from 25-48 miles/wk with 1-2 speed sessions a week, 1 long run every other week, and lots of easier runs. I also included a lot of hill runs and lots of treadmill runs due to weather.

My longest run was 15 miles. My 48 mile week was 3 weeks prior to the race and then I tapered down from there.

# Pre-race

Made a game time decision to wear a long sleeve shirt and tights instead of a singlet due to it being 33F. I was also fortunate to stay at an Airbnb that was literally 2 blocks from the start, so there was no stress getting there. Drank a monster the morning of, taped my nips, took like 4 separate poops, took some Imodium, ate a caffeinated Gu gel, and warmed up around the gear check. Then got my last pee in (thankfully there was plenty of port-a-potties) right before the start.

# Race

Mile 1-4

The first half mile is a slight downhill, then the next 3 miles are all a constant uphill. This was the part of the race that gave me the most stress because I was worried I was going burn myself out. I did so many long hill runs and treadmill runs at 4+ incline for miles to prepare.  My original plan was to maintain a 7:50 pace on this stretch and speed up on the downhill significantly; however, I overestimated how grueling the first few miles would be, and it was actually a very gradual slope, and quickly realized I could pick up the pace earlier than expected. Then I hit that glorious downhill a little over 3.5 miles in which felt amazing.

Miles 5-8

This was the part I was excited about where I knew I could really stretch out my stride and really pick up the pace. Miles 5-7 are basically a constant gradual downhill, and mile 8 levels off a bit. These miles felt great.

Miles 9-13.1

This is the part of the race I really underestimated the difficulty. That first of the many rolling hills comes right around the start of mile 9 and they just keep on coming until the end. I think my heart rate hit 198 on one of the hills on mile 11 which also right around when I mistakenly threw Gatorade on my face instead of what I thought was water and was annoyingly sticky for the remainder of the race. The worst of the hills though was definitely right at mile 12. Once that hill was over; however, it was a sweet downhill to the finish line.

# Post-race

My girlfriend and buddy met me at the finish line and we got to hug it out and there were lots of congratulations, and then we went to go grab some post race beers. I then went up to my Airbnb to shower and then we went down to The Pub and watched Man U play and drank a few more beers and ate some food while waiting for another buddy of mine and his wife to finish running the full.

Once he got there, we grabbed some shots, and some more beer, and then I called it a day and my amazing girlfriend drove my drunk ass back home where I am now posting this race report.

It was a great time! There was a ton of crowd support, I did a lot better than I expected, and had several friends around giving me lots of love. Definitely a great experience.

1072,1708263689.0,Achieving Peak Week mileage with limited time,"Hi! I’m running my first marathon next month, and have been consistently training with no lapses in workouts. This week is my Peak Week, but I’m running up against limited time — miles should be 40 (I’m a slower runner right now since I’m coming back from an Achilles tear, but have run 5 half marathons since end of 2022). Today was supposed to be 18 miles, but we have a wedding to attend so I moved my Thursday run to today since it’s shorter and then will do 18 tomorrow as I’m off for the holiday. But we are expecting a big storm and I don’t have access to a treadmill. I’m worried I’m not going to get that full 18 miles in since we get flooding.

I was looking for similar situations and some folks said that weekly mileage is more important than the long run itself, so could I potentially get 40 miles in broken up in the week if I’m unable to complete 18 tomorrow?

1078,1708194013.0,Running watch - ecosystem & data,"Probably this topic has been raised in the past, but from 2024 perspective it might be worth reviewing.
Which ecosystem except Garmin one do you consider to be most useful for you as a runner? I'm wondering which way to go and invest into - mainly concerned about coros and suunto and respectfully race & pace 3 watches as main run-tracking device - while both devices are fine I'm looking mainly into collecting some feedbacks related to ecosystems around those devices and data they can produce mainly for a runner. While coros is focused mainly on running and barely on anything else, suunto seems to be a bit better balanced probably?
And also, how useful for you is coros' evolab on desktop?",running
1079,1708185902.0,80/20 Running book: Portrayal of Kenya,"I'm reading '80/20 Running' by Matt Fitzgerald. While I'm completely on board with the core message of running slower and further, I find his portrayal of Kenya in Chapter 2 uncomfortable and lacks any kind of nuance about indigenous knowledge. I'm surprised that a chapter like that could be published in a book in 2014! 

The chapter says the following: 'Kenyan runners would never have become the leading force in running that they are today if not for a fortuitous accident. British missionaries in Kenya endeavoured to spread Christianity and education by building schools... Many of the children who attended these schools ran to and from class daily, motorized transportation being a luxury few could afford. The missionnaires certainly had no intention of putting thousands of Kenyan boots and girls on a low-intensity, high volume running program, but that's essentially what happened'...... So, Kenyans learned to run regularly because the British built schools far from their villages? Isn't it also (and much more so) that Kenya has a rich history going back thousands of years where people run long distances to track for hunting? 

By saying that Kenya only started winning marathons since the Boston marathon 1988 completely misses there's a long history of running that's not competitive, and more importantly that's not competitive in Western marathon history. Why is running only something that gets validated when it's noticed in the West? Maybe Kenya's 'rise to supremacy' is viewed as a 'story of overnight success' is because they started showing up to American races...

He says: 'Lydiard-style training came to Kenya at about the same time'.... Why not more accurately say that Lydiard-style running is deeply indebted to the indigenous knowledge among running in Kenya? This 80/20 approach is clearly something that's embedded into the history of running in Kenya. Can't he just say that, instead of time-and-again claiming that missionnaires and trainers from the West arrived in Kenya, building schools far from villages without adequate transport, and emancipating the Kenyans with knowledge that they already possessed and that was actually their indigenous knowledge in the first place?",running

I’ve never met him face to face, despite this being mentioned on several occasions.. I don’t get much feedback and sometimes feel left to my own devices (understandably it’s my goal), is this the norm? 

He’s also still training for ultras alongside coaching, which I don’t mind at all, but maybe feel like his focus is elsewhere?

We're trying to take advantage of one of New Reddit's features, collections.  It lets the mods group posts into Collections.  We're giving it a try on posts that get good feedback that would be useful for future users.  We've setup some common topic Collections and will add new posts to these as they arise as well as start new Collections as needed.  Here's the link to the wiki with a list of the current Collections.

https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/collections/

Please note, Collections only works for New Reddit and the Reddit mobile app for iOS.

###**Using r/running**



The mods do their best to actively moderate this community. When posting, we expect users to make an effort to familiarize themselves with our rules and practices before submitting posts or comments. We suggest taking note of **Rule 2** *and* **Rule 7**, *since these are the most commonly broken which will result in a thread being removed.*

The mod team has tried to lay out the rules with some expected guidelines of what is or is not allowed, but there is always some gray area and posts are up to interpretation by the mod team.  We do our best to be consistent, but that isn’t always the case with multiple mods or even the same mod between similar posts.  The mod team wants to make /r/running a resource for new and experienced runners and to build a community between all types of runners.

Regardless of that fact, Moderators have the final say.  We are open to hearing differing opinions, but the mod team will make the final decision.  Visitors and posters in /r/running are expected to understand that the mod team are people too and doing the best they can to manage a very large sub with frequent posts every day.  If you do not agree with how this sub is moderated, we expect you to do so in a civil manner….and also know when it is time to drop it.

We are very upfront in stating that the sub is heavily moderated, but we do recognize that not every user wants that.  The wonderful thing about reddit is that there are plenty of subs to check out and hopefully find one more to your liking.  If you find the  moderation here too strict, some other related subs with less moderation are /r/runninglifestyle/, /r/BeginnersRunning/, /r/runningquestions/, and /r/Runners/.

_____


###**Recurring Threads**

In order to reduce clutter and nudge you lurkers into posting, we have created a number of daily and weekly threads for you to read, make a comment, or ask a question. Unless you truly believe your new thread will make a new and interesting contribution to Runnit, please wait until the related weekly thread rolls around and post in there instead.  A more complete description of the threads can be [found in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_reccuring_threads).

Here are the current recurring threads with links to the most recent (hopefully) weekly thread:  

*Please note that the search links for the daily threads (Q&A and Achievement) will not work on mobile.  If you are using mobile, sort the sub by ""Hot"" and the current Q&A thread will be stickied at the top.  For the Achievement thread, sort by ""New"" and scroll down a bit to find the current Achievement thread.*

* [Daily Achievement Thread (Posted daily)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=%22achievements+for%22+author%3Aautomoderator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all): Any and all accomplishment posts should be posted here. Anything from new PRs, to longest weekly mileage, to running your first ultra – literally any accomplishments you experienced recently!

* [General Q&A Thread (Posted daily)](https://old.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=Official+Q%26A&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all): With such a large sub, there are a lot of running-related questions that come in every day. In an effort to keep the front page of the sub uncluttered and fresh, we ask you post your questions, particularly those one-off questions that are potentially short and don't necessarily provoke significant discussion, in the daily General Q&A thread.

* [Weekly Training Thread (Sundays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1azfmgc/the_weekly_training_thread/)

###**Rules**
We have further [explanations of the rules in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_rules), but as noted in the side bar, please take note of Rule 2 and Rule 7 as they are the ones most cited for post removals.

 **(2)** - *Posts need to generate discussion and/or useful information that other searchers can then benefit from. Low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts, posts not directly related to running, and questions that are easily answered by FAQ, searching r/running, or Google are subject to removal at the moderation team's discretion.*  

This sub attracts a lot of beginners as well as “drive-by” posting.  A major goal of the sub is to promote quality discussion and develop a community where information and experiences can be shared.  Many of the common questions have been answered, either in previous threads/FAQ, or could easily be answered in the daily Q&A thread.  Yes, circumstances can vary person to person, but it is expected that posters make an attempt to find these answers for themselves before making a stand-alone post.   Visitors should put forth some effort in finding the answer themselves and not expect the Runnit community to do all the work for them.  If the post/question is very specific to your situation (such that other general user won't get much benefit from the information), then it belongs in the daily Q&A thread.

If you do make a stand-alone post, please include info relevant for the community to help.  It is nearly impossible to offer any advice without sufficient background information.  Items that could be relevant:

* Age

* Sex

* Current MPW + pace

* Previous peak MPW

* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed

* Goals (including specific races)

* Previous PRs

* Other things you think might be helpful to include

Below are some of the reason a post would be considered low-quality, thus being removed and directed to the Daily Q&A thread:

* ""Does anyone else..."" type posts?

* ""Is X a good time for...?"" posts

* If your post is a question in the title (including “See title” or “Title says it all” in the body).

* If your question can be asked in one sentence.

* If your question is very specific to you or your situation.

* If your question can be answered either with a yes/no.

* In general, it is helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  

* Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.

Finally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of r/running, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.

 **(7)** - *Do not solicit medical advice. This includes 'Has anyone else experienced this injury?' type posts.*  

While there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some minor, common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  

There is a big difference between ""Hey, my IT band is tight. Got any good stretches for it?"" and ""My shins hurt every time I run. If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?"" If your question involves sharp pains, unknown/vague pains, or injuries/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.

Also, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.

**Training**

Some stats! I'm a 34F, been running pretty consistently for 10+ years. I've ran 3 marathons previously and they've all been the at the Austin Marathon. My last year at Austin Marathon was pretty rough and left me a tiny bit discouraged, and I decided I needed to run a nicer, less hilly marathon. I settled on Mesa Marathon, as it fit right into my desired time frame, had some cooler temps and is relatively downhill.

In preparation for my training cycle, I was running a 30-35 mpw base for a couple of months. I decided to use Hanson's Beginner Marathon as my training plan again, even though I knew it'd burn me out a bit, just like it did last year (just something about only having to do a 16 mile long run, man). All things considered, I really did a great job with consistency here. I only missed one week due to an anniversary hiking trip in Big Bend, but otherwise did every speed workout and long run. I wasn't sure what to expect pace wise-- I loosely had decided that my marathon pace could be \~9:55 but would see what felt right as I ran. Most of my interval runs were sitting around 9:15 and most tempo runs at marathon pace were 9:55 or faster!

**Pre-race**

My parents flew into Mesa a day or two before my husband and I did, and picked us up from the airport. I did not have a ton of PTO saved up for this so only came in on Friday morning and was going to fly out Sunday afternoon. Once we got to our AirBnB, my husband, my dad and I hit an easy 5k and then got set up to go to expo for bib pick up.

After, we decided to go to the Botanical Gardens, which was actually pretty nice. We walked around quite a bit which wasn't really my ideal-- I had no idea it would be THAT much walking! I clocked about 20k steps that day. After, we went and got pizza, made a quick trip to Walmart for a cheap rain poncho (shout out to one of the race organizers for recommending this to me!) and came home for an early sleep. My husband and I were up at 3am to catch our flight before so we were exhausted! I was lucky to be in bed by 8pm and actually slept relatively well.

**Race**

I was up at 2am to make sure I gave myself enough time to eat, drink and get ready. I had 2 packets of oats overnight (loooooove), a nuun and a cup of coffee and got dressed for what was supposed to be a cool and rainy morning. I am a huge fan of cold runs so opted for shorts and a cropped tank, and then just donned that cheap rain poncho and carried a mylar blanket with me. My dad and husband also got up early and we headed for the bus drop off by 3:45 or so, arriving right around 4:30. It was a decent walk in the rain once they dropped me off, but I was glad we did this early as I had heard later that traffic got awful and there may have been some issues with the bus.

I hopped on the marathon bus and had a lovely chat with an older lady who told me she had run this race 9 times and that she was set to run 50 marathons before she turned 50! What a badass. She was a delight to chat with. Honestly, I chatted with a bunch of people since the start time wasn't until 6:30 and it was a great way to pass the time in the cold rain. If any of you are reading this-- let me know how your race went!

Unfortunately, they had to delay the start of the race from 6:30 to 7:00. I was actually a little happy about it because it gave me time to pee beforehand-- but then they suddenly announced later that they were now going to start at 6:50! At this point, I hesitantly began discarding my mylar blanket and poncho and slowly made my way to the start... Only to find out that the race had already started? I was super confused as I hadn't heard any announcement or gun! I then got all my shit together and decided to go.

The weird start really threw me off-- I had planned on running around the 4:20 pace group, but ended up starting behind the 6:00 pace group! Ah!! For the first mile or two, I wasn't feeling great. My toes were cold and wet from the rain and I had a weird side stitch that lasted awhile. I went out easy as planned, though, and enjoyed the first \~3-4 miles that were downhill.

Around mile 4 you start to hit a steady uphill, which felt probably way longer than it actually was. This felt surprisingly difficult, but fortunately it's early on in the race. After that, you're back to gradual downhill. The gal I chatted with on the bus explained that she'd never do the half marathon at Mesa, only the full because the first half is beautiful and downhill, while the second half is flat. I def agree with her! The first half was way better.

I was pretty shocked at the pace I was maintaining and was nervous about trying to maintain it versus slowing it down. I'm always very cautious of going out to quick and have always thought about how you need to start slow to end strong, but I guess my marathon brain went a little haywire because I had decided I needed to HOLD this quicker pace just in case I bonked later and needed to build in walking time. SO backwards, but I was lucky that it worked out for me.

By about mile 9? or so I was running near a group of younger guys who were making me laugh by cheering and shouting all the time. They were such a delight. I tried to run mostly near them just because it was such a joy to have someone cheering and excited. One of the things I didn't enjoy about Mesa was the lack of crowd support-- a lot of times I felt like I was running in mostly silence and without many spectators, and it was such a big change from the crowd support you get at Austin Marathon.

I started up a conversation with those 2 guys and they explained they had signed up for this marathon on a whim a couple of weeks ago and hadn't trained and it was their first marathon! I was so amused/shocked and honestly a little embarrassed that the were maintaining my marathon pace, lol! They felt so fast. One asked me if marathons get easier and I had a good laugh. My first marathon was such a joy, and these subsequent races have always been so much harder since I know what I'm capable of and I'm actually racing them.

I kept up with them for as long as I could but ultimately decided that I was running a little too quick and needed to cool it down a bit so let them pass me. I did see one of them later at a water station but I'm curious how they finished!

At about the half way mark, it began to rain again and I most definitely stepped in a puddle at some point, so that was great. After the half point, it begins to get flat and fairly residential/boring so I was really looking forward to mile 16, where my parents and husband were supposed to be cheering me on.

My dad showed up right on cue and ran with me for a mile where he refilled my hand water bottle and gave me a bag of oranges to munch on. If you've ever read any of my previous race recaps, you'll know my dad is such a joy. He started running because he wanted to run races with me! So he jokingly was telling me that he was now running his 4th marathon. He split off from me after to catch the finish.

By mile 17, it was beginning to feel hard. I don't think I ever hit ""the wall"" per se, but running the same pace on flat pavement definitely was a struggle. I think I did a much better job of fueling and hydrating for this race so I'm sure that helped-- I was alternating salt tabs and huma gels every 2 miles or so, sipping on my hand water bottle and then stopping briefly at most water stations to walk and drink whatever I managed to grab.

By about mile 22, I was really starting to feel it and was finding myself really trying to stick near the 4:20 pacers or slightly ahead of them. I was feeling proud that I had started behind the 6:00 pacer and then managed to catch up to the original pace group I had intended to run with!

It was also around this point where I began to REALLY look forward to the water stations so that I could walk a tiny bit in order to drink something. I remember thinking mile 22 was somehow the last one, and then eventually seeing mile 24 in the distance and nearly crying because I was so thrilled I'd get to walk and drink some more gatorade, haha.

Mile 25-26 were definitely the hardest. The crowds were still so minimal and you can't even see the finish line in the distance! Having never ran this race before, I was trying to find some inkling that the ending was near and it just never came. The sun also started to come out, which I hated, and the balls of my feet/toes were finally starting to hurt due to the wetness.

I actually remember at one point looking at the guy next to me and shouting ""where is this finish line?!"" because I was so over it and I couldn't see it or any huge crowds coming up!

Regardless, I started to really book it in that last mile. There was actually a nice little crowd towards the end and my husband and parents actually made the finish! I started cheering and screaming when I saw them and again, was very overwhelmed with emotion that I was finishing my race and I knew I had PRed my marathon time.

**Post-race**

I got my medal, saw my dad right at the side of the corral and immediately hugged him over the rails. I was tearing up and so was he. Then I made my way through, picking up some snacks along the way and met up with my husband and mom after for huge hugs and congratulations. We were able to go and get a little print out with your race data, and immediately upon reading my pace and finish time, I started to cry. 4:15:00 was the ""A"" goal I had set for myself last year and I was completely shocked that I nearly beat that time this go around! I looked at 9:44 pace overall and was completely overwhelmed with emotion and pride in myself. I was so scared I wouldn't be able to maintain a 9:55 when I woke up that morning.

After, we got some food and headed back to our AirBnb. I was pretty beat up and exhausted so spent the rest of the day laying around watching Twitch. My appetite was shot until I had some great Mexican food for dinner and then I forced myself to eat a pint of ice cream after because... why not? I also found out I did get a couple of blisters on my toes/ball of my foot from the rain that made walking a bit lousy for a day or so, but definitely fine now.

Sunday was my flight back but my husband and I spent a good portion of it wandering around Phoenix to hit up some book stores and local coffee shops. It was great! I even managed to get my 10k steps in (I'm on 1,140 day streak currently) despite my legs still feeling like death.

I'm now mostly recovered-- my calves are a little sore, but I've been getting my 10k steps in and walking. Originally, I had planned on taking a little running break after my marathon and trying to shift my focus to strength training, but I'm finding I already miss running. I don't think I've gone more than 2-3 days without running since my last marathon, and it feels weird. I'm hoping to hop back into some easy runs this weekend, and while I don't think I want to run another marathon soon, I do kinda wanna run an ultra instead, so we'll see what happens.

1097,1707945959.0,Best double jogging stroller,"I have a 17 month-old and a second on the way in May. We currently have the Thule Urban Glide 2 and love everything about it *except* that it doesn't allow our daughter to sit up far enough. Usually it's fine when running as she just passes out anyway, but as she's getting older we can tell that she wants to sit up more. If not for this I would 100% be getting the Thule Urban Glide 3 double, which appears to be equally reclined (though I may be wrong)

What is the best alternative to this and how do they handle infants for the first 6 months before running? We loved the infant insert on the Thule as an alternative to clicking in a car seat. Does any other stroller have something similar? Price is not a concern

1099,1707887032.0,2024 Mesa Marathon - My first full!,"### Race Information
* **Name:** Mesa Marathon
* **Date:** February 10, 2024
* **Distance:** 26.2 miles
* **Location:** Mesa, AZ
* **Website:** https://mesamarathon.com/
* **Time:** 4:13

### Goals

|------|-------------|------------|
| A | The Usual* | *Yes* |
| B | 4:22 (10min/mi pace) | *Yes* |
| C | 4:00??? | *No* |

### Training
I followed Hal Higdon's [Intermediate 2](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-2-marathon/) plan for my race. I'd been running consistently for about a year when I started and was averaging 20ish mpw over 4 days of running a week. I was worried it might be a bit ambitious but it mostly went ok, more on that in a second. I skipped the last 10/20 pair because of a family wedding (no regrets) and missed the occasional run due to whatever illness my toddler brought home from daycare. Overall I hit 530 of the 600ish total miles the plan calls for. Almost every run was done solo before anyone else in the house was up, so major kudos to my Noxgear vest for keeping me alive. No training injuries and lots of miles meant a few new pairs of shoes!

To anyone thinking about doing this plan: I'd strongly encourage you to be at 25mpw before jumping in, and extra strongly encourage you to be already running 5 days a week. 20mpw at 4x a week was not as strong of a starting point for this plan as I hoped. This is not a great plan if you have never run a marathon before or if you have an aggressive time goal. There's no ""speed work"" where speed = faster than race pace. The closest you get is every other week doing some miles at race pace.

Experimented a lot with food/hydration to find what works, and even got myself eating before my long runs despite the already-early alarm clock.

### Pre-race
I ran the half last year so I knew what to expect for logistics. Spoiler alert: they're a nightmare the morning of. Packet pickup was fine on Friday. 3:30am alarm for Saturday, was out the door by 4:10 with toast/PB/banana and coffee taken care of. I even remembered my thrift store discard clothes! The normally 15 minute drive took me an hour (50 minutes to go the last half mile and find a parking spot). Used the port-a-potty before getting in the marathon bus line where I spent 20 minutes standing in the drizzle kindly telling half-marathoners they were in the wrong bus line before they got more busses to arrive. Got on the bus and arrived at the start line 15 minutes before the scheduled 6:30 start.

6:25 - They announce a new start time of 7:00 due to traffic/weather. Not ideal because of drizzle and temps in the low 40s, but whatever.
6:45 - National anthem
6:47ish - They announce a new start time of 6:50. This caused some chaos but I managed to ditch my sweats and get to the start line.

### Race
6:52 I was off. The first half is downhill except for miles 4 to 5.25. I stayed with the 4:05 pace group to take advantage of the downhill without going too fast, but they slowed down more than I was happy with for the climb so I went on ahead (big mistake). I cruised through the first 14 miles feeling really good about myself and wondering if I had it in me to do sub-4. Crossed the half at 2:00:33 which was a big clue that sub-4 wasn't likely, but I wasn't ready to accept it based on how well the race was going for me. Drizzled for the first few miles but let up and got nice for a while.

Started raining/drizzling at or shortly after the halfway mark, and at mile 15 my hips started to feel tight. I was atrocious about stretching and strength training and was paying for it. Kept doing ok until mile 20 where I hit a wall. Mostly physical but was not in a great place mentally either. Managed to do the last 10k where at some point I realized that besides the hip aches, lack of muscle energy, and wet socks/shoes I had also started chafing under my shirt. Everyone who should have clearly noticed was gracious enough to not say anything. I'll just say that I won't be getting any race photos printed. Made it across the finish line at 4:12:59 feeling absolutely awful. My brain and body were both in places they'd never been before.

### Post-race
Limped through the finisher area and grabbed chocolate milk, a banana, some water, and a granola bar. Found my wife and kid and semi-collapsed into them sobbing. Limped around the muddy finish area for a few minutes because I was afraid to sit, then got home and took the most incredible hot shower I think I've ever taken. Surprisingly few blisters. Spent the rest of the day with a toddler who didn't understand why I couldn't pick them up or crouch down to play with them, and turned in early. I'm mostly physically recovered by now, just a few small aches and pains.

I'm very proud of a few things:
-Being really consistent with the training plan
-Finishing!
-Sticking to my ""Gu every 4 miles"" plan and getting fluids at every aid station
-Meeting my original goal of an average pace below 10:00min/mi
-How I felt for the first half. I'll be chasing that feeling for a while.

I had some learning moments too:
-Feeling good on the downhill first half and assuming that means a good second half is a fool's errand for a new runner
-I was not ready psychologically for the back half, especially miles 20-26.2
-This wasn't a super first marathon, course-wise. Not particularly scenic and not a lot of spectators (also lots of roads shared with cars, but I knew that from the half). You won't get a lot of boost from the environment at this race.

Will do it again? A marathon seems likely, at least to do one in better weather, but the Mesa Marathon? Eh. I'm not sold that the convenience of a short drive was worth everything else that happened (both in and out of the organizer's control).

What's next? A trail 40k in April because I'm the fool who signed up for that before the marathon. At least it will be prettier!

*I should clarify my ""The Usual"" goal comment. I've been doing trail races the past year and my partner and I have a joke that goal number one is always don't get hurt. Goal 2 has always been 'finish' and goal 3 has always been 'have fun'. I've combined these into one standing ""Usual Goal"" for all my races.

Elle is perhaps my favorite elite runner. She didn't get much attention when she graduated from high school, as she grew up on a dairy farm in Montgomery VT, population 784. She accepted a scholarship from UNH, and went on to become one of the top women in division 1. 

There was a nice article about her background in the New York Times a couple of years ago (paywalled: [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/sports/olympics/elle-purrier-st-pierre-olympic-trials.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/sports/olympics/elle-purrier-st-pierre-olympic-trials.html)) . It mentions that she keeps her ribbons from the Vermont state dairy show beside her NCAA Division 1 Indoor mile champion award. She has since won a silver medal at worlds.",running

### Training
I started with the hanson's plan, and also had the goal of losing a lot of weight. I went from about 252 down to 230 (and then back up to 237 when exiting my calorie deficit 2 weeks before the race to build up glycogen again) in a little less than 12 weeks while also ramping up my mileage from 15 to 50 miles per week. I then had a weird overuse injury, if you could even really call it that, where I went from not being able to walk without pain in my left foot to being able to run a half marathon training run 10 days later with no pain. Weird. The ball of my foot got super sensitive.

Feel free to look at the other posts in my history (as well as the long, LONG comment chain I had with u/Prudent-Excuse-2800, shout out to him!) to see more details, but I modified my training plan a lot to essentially take out all tempo training runs. I think this was a mistake because, although I am already a very fast runner (21:25 5k, 5:40 mile, 47:55 10k), I think continuing cross training would have helped prevent the foot problem I had. For my peak week of training, which was just before the injury which was 5 weeks before the race, I literally ONLY ran 50 zone 2 miles and did nothing else, which was a bad mistake. Oops. Longest training run was 18 miles.

### Pre-race
Early wakeup! 3:30 alarm led to coffee, bread+honey, and quickly out the door. Traffic was insane to park, the 20 minute drive ended with me parking 1hr25min later instead. This race is point-to-point, so we all loaded the buses (in the rain!) to the start line. They nicely had heaters out, so the 42 degrees + rain didn't hurt as badly. This unfortunately was going to have to be my first time running in the rain, but I was committed! They had race bag drops too, which was nice. Race was delayed by about 20 minutes, I think mainly due to the 10k and half marathon wanting to start at the same time. 6:30 gun.

### Race
SUPER downhill race. I kept essentially great splits the entire time (see above), I was super consistent and I am happy with most of it. The top half of the race is very steep, so my splits were a lot faster, but I don't think that it cost me anything in the back half. I chatted with the 4:20 pacer some, and he noted that this course is a top 5 fastest course, so lots of people fly in to try and qualify for Boston. 

I left the pacer in the dust, basically. He was running a lot slower then I felt I should have been, and I was ahead of him by quite a lot. 

Then, the wall. Calling it the wall feels like such a funny understatement. I am heavy enough to the point where there's just no way I could have stored enough glycogen/processed enough  calories mid-race to not bonk. I think that, if you're planning on running a marathon above 230 pounds, you're just going to bonk hard. I used to think walking was a choice: ""oh, I'm feeling tired, I think I'll just walk for a bit!!"" It felt very, very forced. There was just no, NO way I could have kept running. My pace decreased from 9:50 to 12:20, and my HR increased from 160 to 180 (max HR is 205). I walked for a couple minutes per mile during mile 22, 23, 24, and 25, then I had enough energy to finish 26.2 strong. Some of the most pain I have ever felt in my life!!! Such advanced levels of pain. I think that before I run my next marathon, I will want to be below 200 to guarantee that I don't bonk. Given my times for the shorter distances, it certainly feels like I am a good athlete that is being dragged down by excess body fat (it's all diet, folks!!!!). My goal for the next marathon is simply going to be to not bonk! Miles 15-21 were actually so enjoyable!

I had a crazy leg cramp at mile 26.1 that basically caused me to limp-jump-run to the finish, and the medical team took me away and wrapped me in a foil blanket because I stopped right on the finish line without moving, I didn't feel THAT bad but I guess it makes sense they were worried. Next time I will run through the finish!


### Post-race
Lots of carbs and choccy milk, it's all sort of a blur. Great post-race amenities with PT people, beer, and lots of food! I felt good enough the next day to walk around with my friends at the WM Open golf tournament, but I still feel pretty wrecked as I write this. 

### Conclusion

If you are a heavy guy and are considering starting and training for a marathon, I think that reddit often overblows how much being in a calorie deficit contributes to injury risk. I think it is definitely a factor, but I remember scanning through so, so many comments that advised against it. I think these comments are coming from a place where they think people like me care about performance - I never really cared about maxing out my potential, I cared about finishing something cool while losing weight (as a primary goal) at the same time. Obviously, being in a calorie deficit will hurt your potential, but I don't think many obese people particularly care about their marathon potential, at least not until they lose weight.

I can answer questions if anyone has any, and feel free to DM me more specific questions about being a fatty! I think being obese should correctly be framed for what it is - **deadly**. It's not just a little unhealthy, it is actively shortening my lifespan, and I now feel on track to correct this. Hurray!

### Training  
I did my first 10k in April 2023 and first half marathon at the end of October 2023. I'm grateful that I have a couple of close runner friends who gave me all the tips and tricks throughout the process. I used the Sample Basic Competitor's 16 Week Marathon Schedule from the book *The Competitive Runner's Handbook: The Bestselling Guide to Running 5Ks through Marathons* by Bob Glover and Shelly-Lynn Florence Glover. 

I had one speed work run each week and in the beginning I did them but definitely fell off during the second half of training. I also did strength training 2-3 times making sure to include a leg day each week. My longest run was a 22 miles and I completed 78/89 of the runs in the plan. 

### Pre-race
The week of the race I did body weight legs Tuesday and stopped training with weights after Wednesday (I did not want any part of my body to be sore). I started drinking my electrolyte drink (nuun sport) once a day starting at the beginning of the week. Towards the end of the week I focused on drinking more water, stretching, and for my pre-race meal I had pizza, pasta, and bread! 

### Race
The race began at 7:30 AM and I woke up at 5:15 AM to eat (oatmeal, honey, bananas, strawberries) and stretch/warm up. The weather was cloudy and 49/63 degrees with 76% humidity. The first half of the race was great. I loved running through my hometown and getting to race a lot of the routes I ran everyday in training. There were some hills but nothing too bad. My main goal was not to start out too fast. The beginning was high energy and there were a lot of people along the route cheering (extremely thankful for my support team and seeing familiar faces)! 

The second half was rough because we went down a trail and ran in a more secluded area of Tallahassee. I could see the signs for the mileage on the way back so I knew we would be in this area for 9ish miles. We hit the half marathon mark here and although the scenery wasn't the best there were spectators and aid stations to keep up the moral. Mile 22 was the light at the end of the tunnel because we were finally out of the trail and back to civilization! 

In my training the longest run I did was 22 miles so I was nervous about how the last 4 miles would go... The last part of the race was running through FSU (Go Gators!) and most of the runners were pretty spread out. I almost missed a turn but luckily saw the arrows on the ground before it was too late. Knowing how close I was to the finish helped mask the pain of my legs and right foot (which never hurt during training so that was a nice surprise). My cheer squad was at mile 25 and once I turned the corner to see the finish line I was smiling so big! I told myself whatever minute the timer was on I wanted to stay in that minute. After crossing the finish line my longtime coach, friend, and mentor awarded me my medal! It was the perfect end to a great race!

For fueling I had a hand held 18 ounce Nathan water bottle with one nuun tablet (lemon lime) for electrolytes. I used that and grabbed water at every other aid station. I brought five gels with the intention of using four (Maurten  Gel 100 (2), BPN Apple Cinnamon, Spring Energy Awesome Sauce, and SiS Beta Fuel Gel Strawberry and Lime). I ended up using one gel (four total) every 40 minutes of the race starting at the 6 mile mark.

### Post-race
After the race I had my usual protein shake and took the rest of the day easy. As the day went on it got harder to walk. I could barely move my legs and hobbled around when needed. My feet/toes hurt and I got two nice blisters (one on each foot). Thankfully the next day my legs were not as stiff but still sore. A friend of mine let me borrow her Normatec Compression Legs and it helped so much!

Overall, I am happy with the experience and thankful to all the support my friends and family gave me throughout this. I ended up winning my age group and placing 68/220 people. I can't wait to do another one!

1118,1707739121.0,I Completed The David Goggins Challenge And Asked My Garmin How I Did,"David Goggins is an interesting personality. From my perspective, he's one of those figures you either love or hate. I'm impressed by his perseverance and drive, but his life and fitness philosophy don't appeal to me much. I guess my attitude resonates more with ""zen-like"" runners, such as Anton Krupicka, Scott Jurek, or Eliud Kipchoge. Goggins' bestseller, ""Can't Hurt Me,"" sits on my library shelf, but the bookmark is stuck somewhere in the middle. Sadly, I have no intention of advancing in the lecture.

Still, the idea of completing the infamous David Goggins challenge has always appealed to me. Despite my lukewarm approach toward its inventor, the challenge offers a unique way to try oneself in a different running ""dimension."" The challenge is simple: run 4 miles (6.5 kilometers) every 4 hours, across 48 hours. This means going for a run, resting for about three hours (the four-hour difference is counted between the start of each run), rinse, and repeat. No matter the time of day or weather. Fun fact: when you do the math, the challenge is the equivalent of running almost two marathons within two days.

I've been toying with the idea of completing the David Goggins challenge for several months now. Finally, November 2023 gave me a great opportunity to take it up. The preceding month, October, was pretty hectic. I finished the Berlin marathon (you can read my running report [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/16rpyom/bmw_berlin_marathon32517just_keeping_on_pounding/)) and climbed Kilimanjaro a week later. In late November, I was well-rested and eager for a new challenge – something grandiose yet doable. Ideally something I could take up just a stone's throw from my apartment. Perfect time for the David Goggins Challenge.

## Preparation

Over the years, I've learned that preparations for any type of physical challenge are important. Equally crucial, however, is keeping it simple and concise. So, I spent one afternoon writing down the plan and getting myself ready:

* Conducted short research on Reddit to learn how [others](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/t0q0wj/doing_david_goggins_4x4x48_challenge_need_some/) approached the challenge.
* Allocated 48 hours solely for David's challenge, daily chores, and rest while watching two series simultaneously: ""Jazz"" by Ken Burns and HBO's ""Rome"" (rewatching it after more than a decade; still stands out as one of my favorite series ever).
* Bought snacks, fruits, and, most importantly, ingredients to prepare eight large servings of spaghetti carbonara—my favorite running food. Full of carbs and protein, easy to prepare and digest.
* Wrote down my schedule in Notion and set up a series of alarms on my Garmin accordingly.
* Moved to a separate room, sparing my fiancée the burden of being woken up twice every night for two consecutive days.
* Prepared three sets of running clothes in advance, including a waterproof Goretex jacket, a headlamp for night runs, headphones, etc. It's crucial, especially at night, not to waste time looking for fresh clothes (as it deduces minutes from the sleep time).

## The Challenge: The Subjective

Contrary to what I read before completing the challenge, it is not as hardcore as Goggins himself. The runs themselves are not physically brutal. I think that 4 miles is a very forgiving distance, even when completed repeatedly, a dozen times. I may have had the advantage of always making sure that I got at least some sleep at night, as well as taking care of nutrition (hail carbonara!). Quite honestly, the most difficult part was waking up at night, getting dressed, and jogging into the darkness. This was especially problematic during the second night of the challenge. Running at night, soaking wet, through the empty park made me truly appreciate the day runs. The first 8:00 am run in the sun after three days of running in the dark was glorious.

In hindsight, one thing that I should have done is stretch more. As I mentioned before, the physical load your body has to bear is equivalent to two marathons. My constantly stiff (yet not painful) legs were begging for a stretching and rolling session. Also, at the end of the last few runs, my back and shoulders got super stiff and started to hurt a bit. But I was too busy eating or doing daily chores to properly take care of my muscles (David Goggins: were you too busy, or are you making up excuses, boy? Me: you're probably right, David, I am a mere slave trapped in the cage made of excuses).

## The Challenge: The Objective

After completing the challenge, I was super eager to pull the data from my Garmin and see what the data reveals about my runs. Surprisingly, this is not a trivial task. Initially, <u>I thought that every workout tracked by Garmin was being saved locally on my watch, but this is so not true</u>! To retrieve your data as files, you need to first sync your device and send the data to Garmin servers through Garmin Express. Only then, using [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com), can you download a `.csv` data summary of your workouts from the website - but this data is super limited!

Contrary to what you might expect, the workouts cannot be fully pulled locally from the watch. Well, you know how the saying goes: ""not your key, not your coin""; I'd say ""yes, your watch, but no, not your data."" To get your hands on your `.fit` workout files, you need to explicitly ask Garmin to share them with you. This takes a few hours up to a few days until you receive an email message from the company with the link to your data. Only then, using some open-source libraries such as [fitdecode](https://github.com/polyvertex/fitdecode) or [fitparse](https://github.com/dtcooper/python-fitparse), may you attempt to parse out the data that interests you and start gaining some insight from it. I built a small [script](https://github.com/dtransposed/dtransposed-blog-codes/blob/master/kipchoge/kipchoge.py) that takes a set of `.fit` files from my running workouts and converts them into a human-readable dataframe.

Note: In theory, `.fit` files should be exhaustive and contain all the information that your Garmin watch has access to. Sadly, I couldn't find some crucial information such as the number of calories burned, training load, or dehydration level. I know that Garmin does store them somewhere since I can find them (and many, many more items) in my Garmin Connect mobile app dashboards. Nevertheless, I managed to pull out crucial data about my run and inspect it using [this simple notebook](https://github.com/dtransposed/dtransposed-blog-codes/blob/master/kipchoge/analysis.ipynb).

(yeah, this write-up is also intended who people who can code :))

[Diagram 1](https://github.com/dtransposed/dtransposed.github.io/blob/master/assets/18/4.png)

Each of the twelfth inclined red lines represents a distance of 4 miles (6.5 km). Between the start of each run, there are 4-hour gaps. As demonstrated by the chart, my first run started on 11/22/23 at 19:00, and the challenge was finished with the final run at 16:00 on 11/24/23. To compute the average pace, I converted the speed from default units (meters per second) to runner-readable pace (minutes per kilometer). It turns out that my pace was not steady at all, as it would be if I were running a marathon, for example. I was having fun: going faster when I felt like it or slowing down. This amounted to an average pace of around 6 min/km, indicating that every 4-mile run took me around 40 minutes.

[Diagram 2](https://github.com/dtransposed/dtransposed.github.io/blob/master/assets/18/5.png?raw=true)

The heart rate also reflects the fact that I was running ""by feeling."" The data shows that during the challenge, my minimal heart rate was 76 bpm, my average heart rate was 150 bpm, and my max heart rate was 180 bpm. These are very plausible and non-surprising numbers. An interesting fact: the further in I am in the challenge, the bigger the variance in speed/heart rate. It clearly shows that I was much more fatigued, unfocused, and rather dragging my body than running in a composed manner.

[Diagram 3](https://github.com/dtransposed/dtransposed.github.io/blob/master/assets/18/6.png?raw=true)

Another piece of data being saved is the latitude and longitude information from the built-in GPS. Funny enough, by default, Garmin saves latitude and longitude in the [obscure ""semicircle"" units](https://forums.garmin.com/developer/connect-iq/f/discussion/298963/retrieving-position-location-coordinates-in-semicircles-units-not-possible). Not sure what the use case for this representation is, so converted semicircles to degrees. So now, it is clear that I was located roughly at `51°N 17°E` at the time of the run (which you can check by looking those coordinates up).

That's all the valuable information that I was able to get from my Garmin `.fit` files for this challenge. I managed to pull information about the running cadence or running power, but that's not really interesting. It's a shame; we know for a fact that Garmin collects tons and tons of items, even most exotic data, like estimated sweat loss.

In summary, completing the David Goggins Challenge provided a unique and demanding experience. The subjective aspects highlighted physical challenges, especially during nighttime runs, while the objective (sparse) data from my Garmin revealed insights about my pace or heart rate. The overall experience was enlightening and rewarding, showcasing the intersection of physical and mental endurance.

### Training

In Feb 2023 I tore the shit out of my meniscus. Bucket handle tear from jiu-jitsu, needed surgery to repair it, and I was on crutches for a bit over 3 months. Timing was actually very fortunate that I was able to walk for my wedding/honeymoon in June. I got back to being able to run around August of last year, and kept it up after my physical therapy ended. 

In November of last year a friend mentioned he was going to watch the Philly marathon, and I decided on a whim that I want to do something like that. After looking up marathon training plans and seeing the mileage, I realized that is not something to decide on a whim, and I settled for trying a half first. Decided to follow Hal Higdon's novice plan and downloaded the NRC app which was quite nice for the guided runs. 

There was no actual race I was entering, I was just going to run it based on the timing of the plan. It worked out though that I was going to run my personal race a few days before the anniversary of hurting myself, and I used this as a bit of extra motivation. Unfortunately I had a work trip last week and had to delay my race, but I'm not one for putting stock in arbitrary symbolism anyway (unless it tricks my brain into motivating me).

Based on my current running fitness the HH Novice plan was reasonable, and I followed the plan without skipping any workouts. Basically just followed the plan exactly, using one day a week to run a tempo/speed run and the rest as easy running. Had to repeat the second to last week because of that work trip but otherwise I thought the plan was good.

### Pre-race
Normal pre-long run routine, woke up, drank my coffee and some water, had a cookie and peanut butter cup (peak nutrition) and emptied my bowels. Felt good, a bit anxious for sure but knew I could do this. I'd had a huge meal the night before and tried to eat some extra carbs. 

### Race
Did not go quite according to my plan. I wanted to start running around 10:10/mi, drop 10 seconds a mile, and then settle in around 9:40 for most of the race. First 3 miles of my route were a bit uphill so I tried not to overdo it, and ended up going too slowly I think. I'd gotten a Coros watch in early January and think I put too much stock into the default HR zones without doing a fitness tests.

Around mile 5 I realized I'm just going to need to ignore the HR zones and speed up a lot if I want to hit my goal. At 7.1 miles I crunched some numbers and saw I had to do sub 9:30 the rest of the race to hit my 2:10 goal. According to my watch I was well into threshold HR zone for pretty much the entire rest of the race (165-170 bpm), but I felt great for the most part. Using the NRC half marathon race guided run was incredibly helpful for the second half of this race to just stay focused, maintain my form, and keep my breathing steady. Was able to bring it home just under 2:07 which I'm very happy about. I knew the 2:05 would be a reach. As a bonus, I crushed my previous 10k PR by 45 seconds lol. Not sure if that reflects how poorly I paced that 10k or how poorly I paced this half, I'm but happy to improve that time as well. 


### Post-race
Mostly feeling fine. Did a bit of stretching and walking after, and have been eating quite a bit. Calves are sore but I don't think I overdid anything so I'm happy.

Main lessons to take away I think are that I need to do a fitness test and actually check my HR zones if I want to use them in the future. Also need to learn how to better pace myself in races, I basically did the same thing of starting way too slow  when I did my 10k as part of the HH plan.

My plan now is just to keep up with my training and build up to 30 miles/week for a couple months. Maybe enter some other local races and think about signing up for the Philly marathon in November.

### Background
I [20M] started running in June of last year, from basically 0 athletic ability in any form. I've always hated gym classes in school and never saw myself as someone of any athletic ability. I was chubby for basically my entire teenage life until I managed to get down to the healthy range in 2022. I've always had body dysmorphia and huge self esteem issues in part due to this. I started with couch to 5k but quickly realised that it wasn't going to take me the full length of that program to run the 5k. I think I ran my first full 5k about 4 weeks in clocking in at 25:02. Annoyed by this I decided to run the next day and got the sub 25 lol. I kept running without any real goals just running faster or longer each time until about October when with my university running club I entered a 5 mile race in which I came 8th overall and first in my age group. This made me realise that hey, maybe some of these races I could actually win, which to me, someone who had never achieved anything athletically, blew my mind. Since then I've been using Runna to train for a marathon this may with an inital goal time of 3:30. As I've been getting better quickly however this dropped down to about 3:15 (the projected goal my Runna plan provides me). Anyway onto this race.

### Pre-race
Tried not to change anything up. Got 8 hours of sleep, had my 60g of porridge with 200ml of milk and banana as well as a cup of coffee. Drank in total about 750ml of water with a hydration tab. Planned on taking 3 gels with me, one about 10 minutes out from starting and two more at 30 and 60 minutes. I was incredibly nervous walking down to the race start with my club and I think it showed.

### Race
Had a friend / rival running the race and he was starting near the start so I decided to join him even though I was planning on sticking to 4:30 (begrudgingly as this pace feels a bit slow to me and I can never get into a groove, but as it was my first half I wanted to make sure I would actually complete it (longest run I've ever done before this is 16km). I start off strong with the second pack of runners clocking in that initial 4 minute km. At the beginning I was worrying that I was doing the aged old starting too strong, so I dialed it in a bit but after about 5k I promptly realise that I felt completely and utterly fine, so I started to make my way from just a few seconds behind the pack to leading and ultimately leaving them behind. I took my first gel around this time, and that would be my last. I never felt like taking the next was going to be helpful throughout the rest of the run (I don't really like taking them, they don't cause me any issues but it takes me ages to consume them). I continued to feel very strong probably until about 17km in where it finally started getting a bit draining, but at this point I was already so close that I held and for the final 2k pushed the pace to get it done. Wasn't expecting a time like this at all, but from what I can tell I'm always capable of more than I'm expecting when I go for it. I'm just so proud of myself and feel like I've come so far from who I was in the past. I can't wait to keep getting better. 

### Post-race
Felt a bit sore in like one spot, but tbh I'm feeling completely fine writing this a few hours after finishing. Will take at least two days off and then hop back into marathon training if I feel good. After inputting this result into Runna it now predicts me a 2:59:00 finish for the marathon, so I guess I know I'm going for sub 3 for sure now, but it seems a bit outlandish to go from absolute 0 to sub 3 hour marathon in less than 1 year. I believe I've got it in me though.

The thing is we're moving in 2ish years and won't bring a lot of stuff with us, so this treadmill will be for short-term use. Hence, why I'm buying used and going into this with flexibility in mind.

With that in mind, what are some suggestions on what I should look for when buying a treadmill, i.e. a warranty, X brand is usually great, stay away from X brand, check out this part before buying (the band tension maybe a good thing to check?), etc.

- I'm 130lb
- run for up to 40 minutes (usually 20) at a nice jog, with an all out blast for the last 5 minutes or do

HRT-E involves reducing the levels of Testosterone in my body and increasing that of Estrogen such that both fall into the range of a cis (""natal"") female.

Link to my first post which outlines my overall goals/approach as well as results from the first month:

&#x200B;

So work kicked into high gear after the holidays - which serves as my excuse for compiling this somewhat late.   Since I am working off a 4 week training cycle, the last day of ""Jan"" here is Sunday the 28th.   One thing I forgot to mention in my last post is that I break each main training block down into four week cycles consisting of three weeks ""on"" and one week ""off"" (or cutback).   The general recommendation for my age is to go two weeks ""on"" but so far three weeks still works well for me -- though if I am feeling abnormally tired I will drop down to two until I recover.

OK - so **Jan Results**:

The goal was to drop down to 35 miles per week and keep the average right around 8:34.  this was meant to effectively be a cut-back *month* to ensure I healed up from a bout of Covid at the end of Dec.   As a cut-back, I was expecting to finish my runs with plenty of left over energy as well as have to hold myself back on occasion.   As a reminder, all of my efforts are directed to an overall goal of dropping my 5K time into the low 18's during the ""A"" races of October.

The following table shows my actual numbers along with a comparison to last year

|Jan 2023 - Dist|Jan 2024 - Dist|Jan 2024 - Ave Mph|
|:-|:-|:-|
|23|35|8:34|
|30|28|8:34|
|30|35|8:43|
|20|35|8:55|

I am also lifting - 2 sets of 12 to exhaustion.  In the third week of the cycle I increased the sessions from 2 a week to 3.   While the lifting sounds a bit excessive for a runner, I reduce quite a bit during build and drop it altogether during the race period.

The final metric is my weight which I am keeping an eye on to ensure I do not fall below the recommended limit for my height (148 pounds).   I have been doing this nearly daily since June and try to reduce variables by measuring at the same time every morning prior to breakfast.   In the context of HRT, this data point is interesting because I have heard from several people that Estrogen can lead to weight gain.   Thus far, however, I have not deviated from the 153-155 range - which has been the pattern since I started in June.

From the raw numbers it looks like I hit my goal.   What this data does not show, however, is the level of effort - though you can kind of get a hint by the way my avg mph rises in week 3 and 4.

*Week 1*

* Pretty much as planned.   Easy effort, no problem hitting 35
* 2 sessions of weights.  Still progressing.

*Week 2*

* Life intervenes, as it does occasionally, and I had to drop mileage.   Effort was still easy.
* In response to the drop, I decided this was significant enough to count as the break I was looking for and intended to increase mileage to 38 for the last 2 weeks and \_possibly\_ drop the time if I felt ok.   Given that I was hovering around 45 just 2 months previously, this should not have been an issue
* Joint pain I was concerned with last post disappeared at the end of this week
* 2 sessions of weights

*Week 3*

* Had 2 runs where I expected to do 8-10 but stopped at 5 because it felt like my chest was constricted and I was not getting enough error.   This was a very odd feeling that I have never had before.   It was even odder because my \_perception\_ based on ""listening to my body"" was that I was going at a nice easy pace.   Breathing smooth (a key I look for) and arms staying loose
* By the end of that week it was clear something was off.  On a hunch, I took a look at my heart rate and, sure enough, it was elevated for all the runs.   Looking back to Nov (pre-HRT) and Dec, my max never got above 160.  In week 2 and 3 it was spiking to 172 -- far too high for an easy pace given my absolute max is just north of 180.   So much for being able to listen to by body.
* With this information I adjusted the pace down even more for week 4 and targeted 35 miles
* 3 sessions of weights.   The issues I was having with running did not carry over to lifting - still progressing as normal.

*Week 4*

* For the most part I was able to get both my HR and effort level back within the expected range
* I did have one other ""episode"" where I was forced to stop early due to chest tightness.

Ok, how should I interpret these results and adjust for next month and beyond?   Before I get there (why hello elephant), let's talk about

**The ""E"" and ""T"" effects**

By the end of this cycle I had been on HRT for 8 weeks.   Up to near the end of week 5, I quit literally felt nothing.   This was surprising because I had been told that, at minimum, I should feel the effects of Sprio almost immediately and that physical changes would happen by week 3.   I had (nearly) given up when, out of the blue, I started feeling it in my chest area -- pain and super sensitive.

I am bringing this up mainly as evidence that the hormones are doing *something*.   This is important because I don't really know, until I have my first blood test at the three month mark, whether my T is actually dropping significantly.   This is exactly why they test -- so that if you are still in the male range they can adjust the dose upwards.

**Analysis/Adjustments**

Given all of this I am cautious about interpreting my Jan results has HRT related.   Yes, chest tightness sounds awfully suspicious but, on the other hand, I have not heard anyone else talk about this.   Dead legs?  Yes.  Chest tightness/difficulty breathing?  Nope.

The bottom line is that at this point it is too early to point to HRT -- the increased effort of my previous ""easy"" pace could just as easily be chalked up to natural fitness decline - accelerated by age - from no hard efforts since October.  Incidentally, this fits in well with the experience of a few of the commenters to my last post -- the feeling was that I would really feel it *after* month 2.

Regardless of cause, of course, I *do* need to adjust.  I'm not going to hit my goal by running in that dreaded grey zone between easy and true threshold -- especially during base which is all about preparing the legs for the stresses to come.

So my plan is to increase the ""easy"" range to just under 9 min miles, but ramp up the distance to 40 -- probably in a straight progression like 35, 38, 40.    With any luck, that will set me up for \~45 for March which still keeps me on track for the base period goal.

That's it for this month.   If you made it this far, thanks for reading.  I hope this is was useful.",running
1148,1707278785.0,"My first ever race, full marathon","Hello everyone! I had an incredible time this weekend at my first ever race and wanted to share my experience.   
Huntington Beach   
Surf City Marathon   
February 4th, 2024   
Race Start: 6:30am  
Finish time: 5:10:49  
Goal 1: Finish the race - goal accomplished!!  
Goal 2: Finish in under 5 hours - failed  
**Background:**  
I’m a 27 year old male, up until 5 months ago I never really ran over 2-3 miles for fun. I never really enjoyed or understood why people liked running and never really thought it would be something I ever got into. I played various sports growing up and mainly golf and go to the gym for physical activity now.   
Once things started going back to normal after Covid (2022), I realized I spent most of the pandemic on bad habits, drinking a lot, eating bad food, not exercising nearly as much as I should have, and mentally I was in a rut and unhappy with my decisions. I did 75 hard which helped me lose about 15 lbs and get back into decent shape, but again I slipped and never established a routine.   
I started reading books on self help and business, listening to podcasts looking for motivation and other ways to build better habits. One person I enjoyed listening to was Jesse Itzler. He talked about a life resume, and challenging yourself every year to do something big that you can look back on later in life.   
Now you’ll probably roll your eyes but David Goggins was another one, I read both of his books and listened to him speak on a couple podcasts. I loved the way he talked about doing hard things and things you don’t want to do in order to become stronger.   
So I started playing with the idea in 2023, what if I ran a marathon?  
It wasn’t until a friend of mine I work with said “sign up for a marathon with me” that made me pull the trigger. This was mid August, he had run several half marathons before but never a full, and he asked if I’d sign up with him.   
So I did  
**Training:**  
After signing up and making sure I wasn’t able to cancel and get a refund (one of the ways I made sure I wouldn’t back out), I started looking online for where I should start. I found a plan called “couch to marathon” on a website called Marathon Handbook, and downloaded the excel sheet.  
This plan started off slow and built more and more miles in different phases  
1. Couch to 5k  
2. 5k to 10k  
3. 10k to Half Marathon  
4. Half Marathon to Marathon  
I didn’t take a lot of the couch to 5k training that serious because I felt like I was already in decent enough shape to do a couple miles per session (this phase was more interval work). So the month of September was a little inconsistent, running a couple times per week.   
Once I got to the month of October, decided to do Sober October, and followed the plan running 4 times per week, I started seeing the results and started to love the process.  
Each week felt like I was shaving off time and I started to understand why people like it, it’s addicting seeing the results and building on each run. Plus I mostly ran in the morning right after waking up and before work, so I went into my day feeling amazing.  
The holidays threw a little bit of a wrench into my training, I grew up on the east coast and travel back and forth for the holidays, so training outside in the freezing cold wasn’t ideal, I got runs in on a treadmill but between holiday plans and caving to laziness, I missed a couple runs.   
Leading up to the marathon I had a handful of 12-14 mile runs under my belt through training and one 20 mile run, which really put into perspective how long 26.2 miles was really going to be.   
Looking back, I wish I stuck better to my plan and did more runs in the 15-18 mile range to get ready since that is when it starts getting real.  
Regardless, I was really proud of myself on the progress I made. One of the best parts of training was hitting a new personal best for longest run each week, and each time I extended the distance it moved the goal post for what I thought was possible.   


**Day before the race:**  
My brother actually surprised me and flew out to California to support me, capture some videos, and be there for me at the end of the race, which was one of the best parts of the the whole weekend. We headed to Huntington and checked into our hotel across the street. Headed to the expo to pick up the bib and some merch, and got my first look for what an organized race is like.   
Everyone was super nice and excited for race day, and it was fun to see my name written on the big sign with everyone who signed up, and to take pics with the 26.2 mile surf board cutout they had.   
Headed back to the room, laid out all my clothes and supplies, and made sure everything was ready for the next morning.   
Had way too much trouble sleeping from the adrenaline, pre race jitters, and my brother snoring in the other queen bed in the room, but eventually fell asleep around 11:30, with a 4:50am alarm set.   
**Race Day:**  
Alarm goes off, and I’m immediately wide awake.  
I wanted to wake up in time to have something to eat, drink some electrolytes, and stretch. After we got ready we headed down to the start area just after 6am and the jitters are set in.  
Runner’s all over the place are warming up, talking to family and friends and getting psyched to start the race. My friend and I found a spot toward the back half of the crowd as we knew we would be in one of the slower waves.   
National anthem plays and the countdown begins, it’s happening!   
We began running at just over an 11min pace and I notice my HR immediately jumps to 175 which is not good, I chalk it up to pre race jitters and adrenaline.   
We maintained that pace feeling good down the stretch of the PCH before breaking off into the neighborhood and park section of the course.   
One thing about this course I did not prepare well for in training was the elevation changes, the course had a couple hills, and during training I almost exclusively ran on flat terrain with only a couple exceptions.   
Even with the hills I maintained around an 11 min pace for the first 8-9 miles and felt great, the HR was in the 160s for the most part so I wasn’t too worried about it. Once we got back on the PCH we were about 10 miles in, still enjoying it and fist bumped my brother in the crowd on the way by.   
We got to the first turn around point at around 12 miles and that’s when we noticed we were running with the wind, I knew this would be a factor later but again, wasn’t worried about it too much yet, just focusing on the next mile.  
Mile 14 was still in good spirits and feeling great, saw my brother again and yelled to his camera “running is easy!!!”   
I was wrong  
We got to the next turn around point to go back out up the boardwalk and that’s when it started getting real, the 17-18 mile area is when I started really feeling it in my legs and feet, and when I saw my brother again, running was not so easy anymore (lol). This is also where the 5 hour pacer passed me and I realized I might not accomplish the under 5 hour goal.  
Doing only one 20 mile run in training, my body wasn’t fully used to runs over 15 miles, I started taking my time more at the water stations to catch my breath and walk for a moment. I was only a mile or so away from the last turn around when I noticed almost everyone going back the other way to the finish was struggling, a lot of people walking and realized the wind was blowing even harder than before.  
The last turn around was just about mile 21 and as soon as I rounded the cones, BOOM, was hit by a 30mph gust that felt like a wall.  
My pace was around 13 mins at this point fighting the wind with 5 miles to go, my quads felt like there was a knot twisted nice and tight just above both of my knees.  
They say the last 6 miles are the hardest part of the marathon, and that couldn’t be more true especially with winds 20-30mph in your face.  
Mentally, I took it one at a time, just had to make sure my feet kept moving.  
Chanting “5 miles left you can do this” “you do this all the time”  
“4 miles left you can do this home stretch”   
And kept repeating down to the last mile  
Finally I’m back at the PCH, chanting to myself “you’re almost there”  
I can see the finish, and I get more energy knowing I’m going to make it.  
Seeing the crowd everyone cheering on each runner with different signs with words of encouragement was so amazing, I was smiling as I ran through the last couple hundred feet and finally cross the finish line.  
I saw my brother and my friends family and gave them hugs, and continued walking down the finish area where I was overwhelmed by emotions.  
The realization of the last 5 months of runs and the mental battle I fought to keep myself in the race and get through all 26.2 miles and succeeding was one of the best things I’ve felt in a long time.  
**Thank you**  
I want to thank everyone in the running community for being so welcoming and everyone that attended the Surf City marathon for being so encouraging.  
Thank you if you read this far.  
There’s no doubt in my mind I will run another marathon, especially now that I have a time to beat!

**Goals:**

|Goal|Description|Completed?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|25 min finish|yes, smashed it|

**Training:**

I didn't undertake a particular training plan but I have ran, walked, or hiked everyday since August 1, 2023. Yes, literally every single day since then I have done something. On most of those days I tried to at least do 30 minutes on the treadmill or at least 3 miles outside if the conditions and my mood allowed. Over time I've been increasing the daily mileage to where it is around 4.5 miles a day. My long runs are typically 10Ks which get done on weekends or when I attend Atlanta Run Club on Monday evenings. Overall I wouldn't say I had the most optimal training but when I began running everyday my PB was around 28 minutes or so for the 5K although I will admit I had never truly pushed myself to see what my fastest is.

**Pre-Race:**

The race took place at 8am so pre race I woke up around 6:15 and laid in bed a bit wondering if I really wanted to do this. After deciding yes I through my leggings and pullover on due to it being a cold 40 degree morning and then proceeded to decide what shoes I was going to wear. It was between the Nike Streakfly which is supposed to be purpose built for 5Ks or the Prime X 2 Strung which I got maybe a month ago and has become my favorite shoe to run in. I ultimately decided on the Prime X 2 Strung and headed out the door. I drove to the nearest MARTA Station (Atlanta's public transit) and rode the train to the location of the race. I arrived at the race sit at maybe 7:20ish or so and waited in line to go through the metal detectors to be let into the venue and go to the table to pickup my bib.

**Race:**

After waiting for everyone to get pictures with the Atlanta Hawks mascot Harry the Hawk and the national anthem to play we were off at 8:02 am and running. I'm not sure how it was decided but I was in A wave so in the initial group that was let go although I hung towards the back since I had no intentions of trying to to win this race. The beginning of the race went pretty well, I was running at a fairly comfortable pace albeit faster than I was expecting. I'm not sure if that was just do to the crowd of people running to through the streets with me dragging me along or the excitement of my first race. Around maybe a half mile  or so the first uphill sections (Atlanta, really the entire region of Georgia is very hilly) began and people began to dial it back and slow down. Foolishly I continued to chug on and just stride up and down the hills of the streets of Atlanta. At around the 2 mile mark the longest 2 climbs of the race began, the first was not a very steep climb but it was a fairly long climb running towards the Mercedes Benz Stadium. The race then hung a right and we proceeded to have to go up a long and relatively steep climb. This is around the time I began to burn out and slowed significantly. Up until that point I had run a 7:48 first mile and 7:40 second mile. By the time I finished those climbs about .15-.2 miles before the 3 mile marker my pace had slowed into the 8 minutes. All told mile 3 was an 8:26 mile. Finishing up I came down the hill back towards the starting line and finished as strong as I could for the last .1 of the race I had a 7:59 pace (lol) and I crossed the line in an unofficial bib time of 24:43.

**Post Race:**

I proudly looked at my watch and saw that not only had I gotten to my 25 minute goal (earlier in the week I had set a PB of 25:23) I had beaten it by nearly 20 seconds. I then went to get my complimentary chick fil a biscuit, smoothie king smoothie, bottle or water, and race t shirt and headed back to the train station with a lot of pride in myself. Upon getting back home I took a like 3 hour nap and woke up ravenously hungry.

&#x200B;

Overall it was a very fun experience and I've already signed up for a 10k in march and plan on doing the Peachtree Road Race and PNC 10 Miler later this year as well as possibly the Thanksgiving half marathon on Thanksgiving day due to this first race experience.

### Training

This year, I think I did strike a miraculous balance of [having a chip on my shoulder from DNFing this race last year]( https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/10w9dbh/race_report_heartbreak_at_mile_98_an_early_end_to/), but also being confident in my training to still be able to be wise, careful, and prevent injuries from avoiding overtraining. I knew I was in great shape last year as well heading into the race but faced a DNF from other factors - gear, logistics, body awareness, mental game - so if I could replicate a solid training block and spend some other time on those other things as well, I felt I would be in good shape! I had figured out a new sock and bottom-half-baselayer arrangement which I was confident could sort out the shin trouble I had last year that I feel had knocked me out of the race.  
 
After a big autumn of events, I took a little time off but started to rebuild back up by mid-to-late October through November. My goal was to slowly build back mileage and strength and be intentional about setting aside some time dragging either a tire or pulk sled (if & when it would actually snow – which turned out to be unfortunate foreshadowing). Ended up with a peak seven-day window of 141 km/87 miles of running/sled-pulling mix and felt pretty great about it, and also happened to tick off my biggest ever training month in December! 

And, if it really counts as ‘training’ (I think it does); I also restarted my meditation practice – I had a great meditation streak going in 2021-2022, and although I didn’t get back on my daily habit this year, still was able to sit and put aside 10 minutes here and there and I really appreciated when did. I swear winter ultra hiking/running can be just a big long meditation sometimes! 

### Pre-race

Arrived in International Falls two days ahead of the race again like last year – really appreciated having some loose, unstructured time to check out the trail conditions, reconsider gear based on the weather & snow situation, and not feel rushed at gear check or the race meeting. Had the joy of getting to come up with my mom and dad, as, in their retirement, they were interested in coming to volunteer at the race while it was happening, which was super cool of them. There was also a showing of a [documentary film they had made about the race a few years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guLGd1nUw18) which we checked out. Certainly added to the stoke! 

The word on the street was it was going to be a weird and warm year – sloppy and wet snow, some open water(!) sections on the trail, and some totally untouched snow for some portion of it. At the pre-racer meeting they covered some of the challenges unique to these conditions, such as the danger of frostbite being somewhat replaced by the danger of trenchfoot, and needing to be be more aware/on-top-of navigation with ungroomed/untouched trail portions. I had even gone so far as to bring a big 85L hiking trail backpack with me in the car if there wasn’t enough snow to pull a sled but looks like fortunately there was mostly at least some amount of very thin snow covering but not too too many straight-up bald patches.  So the pack could stay in the car and the sled could make the trek. 
After a last supper, tucked into bed at a pretty reasonable hour, and set my alarm for 5 AM to get ready to go time. 

### Race

Zipped and loaded up my sled and pulled up to the central park in town by the hockey rink and could feel the nervous/excited/manic energy just buzzing in the field of athletes. The sea of blinky lights and determined stares and wild and wacky sled and bike set-ups is just an incredible sight. After the bikes set off, the foot division folks then trundled up for their 7:04 AM sendoff on their ~135 mile adventure (some, of course would not finish all of those miles, while others would go to add at least a couple extra in their navigation misadventures). And we were off!

I suppose because of being right in town and reasonably well-trafficked by snowmobiles, and with the sun still being down, the trail was pretty well firm and packed to begin with at this stage – a welcomed and unexpected treat! Lots of chatting and greeting other racers and slowly watching the sun come up. In this first stretch, had a great time moving for awhile with 15- (or was it 16-?) time Arrowhead 135 finisher John Storkamp and local legend Jeff Goldstein, who was going unsupported in the race, meaning no access to any amenities at the three race checkpoints. Turned out John and I had a love of bog plants in common and happily chatted about local plants as we spotted them and conjectured on their potential uses, edible or otherwise.  

After a good, overall 38-ish-mile stretch, pulled into the first checkpoint, Gateway General Store. Like a normal ultra said station, there was lots of hot food, but as the name suggested, unlike a traditional ultra aid station, it was for purchase, and we were eager customers. After a quick shirt swap and another sock change, I refilled my water bottles at the fishing supply counter sink with the help of a gracious volunteer and pulled out my wad of cash and credit card I had stashed in my sled. Enjoyed just looking around for a minute at all of the options and settled on a pair of hot cheeseburgers in the warming tray, a poweraid, and some cookies. 

Headed out from Gateway into the first night and was feeling re-energized by the right balance of cheeseburger and forward progress. Almost right away, encountered several people trekking the wrong direction down the trail; turns out they had missed the turn-off to the checkpoint spur trail – can only imagine how frustrating it would feel to add extra mileage to an already plenty-long race. Settled into a rhythm on a much more spread out trail, now only seeing the occasional headlamp or blinky some ambiguous distance in front or behind me. Switched to slamming down a full 315-calorie maple syrup packet every hour or so and they were going down great. Ended the second leg with some gusto across a frozen lake crossing and pulled into the second checkpoint, MelGeorge’s cabins/resorts, route mile 72! 

I meandered to the checkpoint cabin where I knew I could find a spare bed in the loft area and catch some quick shuteye, and think I was able to sleep solidly for a whole 90ish minutes, which I was feeling great about. I definitely had some chafing and foot pain at this point but checked out my feet and the blisters weren’t too rowdy, nor had my feet gotten wet at all the last leg!  I dusted myself off, refilled my water, vaselined up any chafing hotspots from my emergency sled Vaseline stash, and got moving again! I knew a few things – your odds of finishing are close to excellent when you leave that second checkpoint, and also that the next stretch was long, hilly, and hard. 

Then, at some point, the darkness of the second night started to set in. The texture of everything started to shift and it’s like I could feel the real devious and sinister nature of the race start to take hold. It felt like every moment you wanted to just make a push on some flat trail or get some momentum, rounding the corner presented an even bigger and steeper hill. I remember spending a lot of time staring down at my feet so I didn’t know how much of the climb was left, just one foot in front of the other. Getting to the top of the hill and leaning all the way forward down onto my trekking poles to hold my weight, or even once or twice collapsing on top of my sled for a split second. Emotions flooded in and out, and had 3 or 4 solid sobs/cries, which would last anywhere between a single gasp or about a minute of strong feelings. It feels like this was really where I leaned into my meditation practice – there was nothing I could to do to change the trail, or the weather, or the gear I had brought with me. I did have the power to accept what the trail gives and be grateful for the chance to be out there. I also had totally forgotten that second cheeseburger still in my vest and absolutely dummied it into my face, which gave me a huge boost. Eventually I crossed paths and linked up with Doug from New Zealand, who I had spent time with the year before and eventually we DNFed quite close to each other, at miles 100 and 110 respectively. Doug and I were both struggling but we hammered on through the night together, cresting hills, slamming maple syrups, gawking at the moon. Mostly in a comfortable silence. After a false alarm or two, at route mile 112, we rounded a corner and saw the third checkpoint, which is a bonfire beside a canvas tent in the middle of the woods, an absolute oasis in the night. I dapped the shit out of Doug and we wandered into camp, exhausted and hopeful. 

I knew my best chances of finishing were a second quick nap, food, water, but also not getting too too comfortable with hanging around there. On a great suggestion from a race volunteer, filled up my water bladder with hot water and tucked it into my sleeping bag with me which really warmed me to my core. Slept for about 60-70 mins this go around with a couple of fitful wakeups but finally felt my eyes open with a certain determination and assuredness which somehow dawned on me that I was finishing this friggin thing. 

The fire in my eyes was lit and it took me a little while to pack up, but I was focused to head out, and go steady to the end. I pulled out into the 5 AM darkness of Wednesday morning after leaving International Falls Monday morning with less than a marathon to go. In the last two miles I was surprised to have a feeling I don’t believe I’ve ever had in a race before. I was legitimately saddened at the idea it had to end. I felt like truly after spending so much time huffing down this trail, life had become routine, and simple. My phone had been on airplane mode for literally the start to the finish, no distractions. Some chats and encounters with other racers and volunteers, but it had truly a long, mostly solitary, walk in the woods, and it had been just the prefect thing for the soul. With a quarter mile to go, saw the snow fencing and the crest of the finish up the trail, where, cruelly, you go up one last 20-foot hill in the last 25 meters. And all of sudden, I had crossed that faint line in the snow. 

### Post-race

After some hugs with my parents and a chance to grin from ear to ear for a second, the finish line gear check had to happen quickly, where they confirm you were still carrying in your sled the required safety gear with you for the race – an emergency stash of 3000 calories that didn’t get eaten, a stove with fuel and firestarter, whistle around your neck to call for help, -20 sleeping bag and sleeping pad, amongst other things. I fortunately hadn’t lost any of that stuff from A to B, and got led up into the finish line hotel/casino and into the ‘hospitality suite’, which is a real post-run paradise. Big comfy chairs, a big table with all of the finish line swag, and a buffet of soup, bread, pizza, coke, coffee, water, and all of the other nutritional needs to try to refresh some worn-out bodies. After a call to my wife (where, despite my excitement, I allegedly fell asleep two different times mid-sentence), my dad was kind to bring me a cold beer and sit it in front of me as well, which I surprised myself by being able to drink two! After a couple hours of shooting the shit with other races and volunteers, I guess running on pure fumes at this point, I could feel the heaviness in my eyelids overcoming all of the finish line endorphins and excitement and knew I needed to be way more horizontal. I limped my way to my hotel room and fell into an incredibly deep and incredibly satisfied and incredibly proud sleep. And that was that.

1162,1707172852.0,Runners World UK editor Kate Carter addresses cheating claims,"Kate Carter makes statement to the Telegraph.

She “deeply regret[s] these errors in judgment” but insisted “I am not a cheat”.

In relation to the London Marathon she claims she never sought an official time as she was not in peak fitness.

*But she then ran quicker than expected and wanted to upload it to her Strava account: “This is when I made the mistake of trying to create a route manually based on my time.” she said. “Soon after I realised this was foolish and removed it from my feed.*

[note: but only removed it AFTER Marathon Investigations made it public]

In relation to the London Half Marathon her excuse is even better!!

*she had “very unfortunately and embarrassingly had wet myself and wanted therefore to step off the course to try and sort myself out” which is “something that happens to many runners”.  “When I rejoined the race, it is possible that I did so at the wrong point on the course, though that was not my intention,” she added, insisting that “I made some stupid mistakes in how I recorded my times on my personal Strava record” but that she “was in no way trying to deceive the organisers of either event about my times”.*

[so she basically admits to cutting the course - I don’t buy that this was unintentional.  Even if the wet herself is true she likely cut the course to “make up for it”]

## Training

I started from zero (benchmark: running a mile was tiresome) in early November 2023 and trained up to the Turkey Trot 5K using the Run with Hal Novice 5K plan. I caught the running bug by then and decided to aim for my first 10K by signing up for the Death Valley race. I used the Run with Hal Novice 10K plan, building up my base and focusing on keeping a steady pace (easy enough for me to breath through my nose the entire duration). I built up my weekly mileage to peak on race weekend, averaging a 2.0 mile run on Mondays, 3.0 mile run on Wednesdays, and long run on Fridays. I didn't focus too much on cross-training, but I did make sure to do a proper warm-up before every run – leg swings, calf-raises, and dynamic hip stretches.

## Pre-race

I stayed at one of the hotels near the starting line through Friday night before the race. I went to bed around 10pm and woke up around 6am. The sky was clear, the air was crisp, and the mountains looked lovely against the sunrise. I checked in to get my bib at 6:30am and paid my $15 national park entrance fee required by the race. Afterwards, I had my breakfast coffee and ate overnight oats topped with blueberries and vanilla skyr that I had brought with me from home. 

Pre-race announcements started around 7:45am, and it was cool to learn that one attendee would be racing his 100th marathon. They started the marathon wave, half-marathon wave, and then the 10K wave one at a time, with 15 minutes in between each wave. While I waited for my turn, I warmed up with my usual dynamic stretches and used the bathroom.

## Race

The course was out-and-back consisting of some road and some off-road trail. Headphones were not allowed at the race since the road wasn't blocked off. I was at first worried that we'd be squeezed onto a thin road shoulder, but there was some sort of paved sidewalk for most of the road course. For the off-road trail portion, there were puddles and rocks to dodge. The views were breathtaking – at one point you'd see snow-capped mountains in the distance, and at another point you'd be running in a sort of canyon made by stark, rugged mounds flanking you. Before the aid station turnaround, I had to set my gaze to what was directly in front of my feet since there were quite a few rocks that taunted a potential ankle sprain. 

Overall, I started out slow, aiming for negative splits and finishing strong. I had to slow my pace for the trail portion, but made sure to progressively increase my speed over the last mile. I used the first two miles as a warm-up and then hit my stride at after the turnaround. I sprinted the last 0.1 mile.

## Post-race

I felt great after the race! Since the air was so crisp, I didn't feel like I was overheating or sweating. I was ecstatic that I achieved my goal of finishing strong at my first ever 10K. I'm looking forward to my next race goal!

Currently in the middle of a marathon build. 9 weeks out from goal race. I've known about the Krispy Kreme Challenge since it was on ESPN after starting 20 years ago. I had the chance to be in Raleigh race weekend this year so I sprung at the chance to race it. 

The weather was chilly (35 °F) and windy. Arrived 20 mins before start at the NC State bell tower. Layout and start were well organized. Start was crowded but thinned out within the first quarter mile. First two miles were generally down hill with the last half mile being fairly flat before arriving at the Raleigh Krispy Kreme. 

Picked up donuts quickly and was then handed a water by a volunteer. Shout out to all support staff and volunteers for a smooth and well run race, the friendliness and support is much appreciated! Most challengers sat right on parking lot ground for the eating part of the race, but I chose to stand. I ate two donuts at a time for the first 8. Alternating between large bites of glazed donuts and sips of water. I was starting to get fairly full so for the last 4 I  switched to eating one donut at a time. I  looked around eating my last couple of donuts, the parking lot was now quite full with competitors in their own personal battle of  how to best eat a dozen donuts. I finished the box with a full stomach and sticky hands. I then showed my empty box to the race attendant and began my journey back to the finish. 

While I was full from donuts I didn't feel nearly as slowed by their consumption as I thought I might. I had no appetite to attempt a negative split, but that had more to do with the 2nd half being mainly uphill. I ran hard on the return and even able to pass a couple of folks while only being passed once myself. I crossed the finish happy to have completed the challenge with over 20 minutes to spare. I'm not sure this will benefit or harm my marathon in any way, but I had a fun time and was able to find an excusable reason to scarf down a dozen donuts.",running

* **Location:** Battersea Park, London, UK
* **Time:** 39:04

## Goals

|Goal|Description|Completed?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|A|Sub 40 mins|*Yes*|

## Background

I'm mainly writing this as I didn't see a race report for a Chase The Moon race on Reddit and would have found it useful to answer some questions I had about the race.

I signed up with some friends for the 10km option, and my other half signed up for the 5km race. Entry prices were very reasonable and the main risk was the gamble on the British weather for an evening race. 

## Pre-race

Not really being sure what to expect, we turned up about an hour before the 7pm start. There were some queues to collect race packs but nothing too major. A few stalls dotted around had food/merch, and there were more people attending than I had expected. Safety pins and pens for bibs were provided.

There's a bag drop just next to the finish. Unsure how well secured it was but it was pretty well organised with a marquee to cover from any rain and sections depending on race numbers. The toilet situation was portaloos on grass; completely pitch black, so helpful to have a head torch or mobile phone, and queues were fairly large for these so go early.

One of my friends has a season pass. You turn up and show your card at the special desk (with a much shorter queue). It's expensive but if you're doing at least an event a month including some half marathons then I imagine you'll get your monies worth.

There were two separate race starts (one for 5km - two laps of park - and one for 10km - four laps of the park) which were about a 5 min walk from pick up.

## Race

I offered to try and pace a friend to a sub 40:00, so went out at 4:00 pace. We were near the start of a narrow funnel and got off quickly but you're definitely at risk of getting stuck for a few minutes if you are nearer the back. You get both a gun time and a chip time though so it's no problem. 

There were some clearly high class runners at the front with times in the low 30:00s. There was also a lot of support for all other runners too which was great to see and it's just as good for a novice runner as a more experienced one. Compared to a major event there's obviously less support but it was still noticeable and there were so many other runners on a relatively crowded course it wasn't missed as much as it might otherwise have been.

The route is a relatively flat one, essentially going around the outside of Battersea Park, but there is a noticeable slight uphill on the backend of each lap for about 500m which is a bit of a killer. There are no timing mats on any of the laps but I did see a couple of clearly unrealistic results removed from the leaderboards within the first day.

There was a water table set up just past the start of each lap and despite being dark there were no big problems with visibility / risks of tripping etc which I was very glad about.

Unfortunately my friend was unable to hang on past 6km, so I upped pace slightly. No problems with passing people as the roads are wide, just a bit of weaving to do when overtaking as the numbers increase towards the end of laps.

## Post-race

I didn't actually spot if there was a post race clock, but you get a pretty tidy medal, water, flapjacks, and good protein shakes were being given out too. Overall a very well organised event by RunThrough and I've already signed up for another of their events in a couple of months.

These events run as Chase The Moon / Chase The Sun every month in Battersea Park, 5km and 10kms, so if anyone has any questions feel free to ask.

**Background**

I (27M) am not a runner (or maybe just a beginner one), though I ran this same half-marathon 9 years ago. Back then, it was my first year of college, and I was a pretty active/athletic guy, so I did minimal training – maybe running a 5k or 10k once a week for a handful of weeks leading up to the race. Ran the race and ended up totally messing up my knee, finally stopping at mile 10 and dragging through the last 3 miles with watery eyes as I fought through the pain. Finished in 2:39, by far the longest distance I had ever done. Couldn’t really run the next few months as I rehabbed my knee, and eventually fell into that group of folks that only run once a year in a Turkey Trot 5k. Fast forward 9 years to this past December, my friend and I signed up for the same half-marathon, with intention of doing a full marathon later. I was determined to redeem myself at Surf City.

&#x200B;

**Training**

We followed Hal Higdon’s novice plan, and I invested in some good running shoes (Novablast 4) and an Apple Watch so I wouldn’t have to carry my phone all the time. We didn’t really know what our easy/moderate/race paces were, so we just ran miles and would regularly check how we felt. Our “easy” pace was about 10 min/mi, and we figured with enough training, we could set our “race pace” goal to be around 9:10 min/mi to get to the 2-hour mark for the HM. That first month, I was in a rhythm and my body felt good enough to push for longer periods of time. Sub-2 was looking very possible.  
However, second week of January, I developed shin splints. I was in the middle of a run, and the pain was so bad that I could barely walk back to my car. I did all the research I could to recover my shins quickly, as the race now less than one month away. I took a week to recover and became more intentional with stretching/warming up before runs, my cadence/form during runs, and icing/rolling out after runs. Slowly got back into my training for three weeks, and I was feeling rested and fresh going into the weekend.

&#x200B;

**Pre-Race**

The race was slated to start at 7:45am, and I didn’t fall asleep the night before until around 11:00pm, waking up at 4:45. Pre-race jitters. I stretched out, ate toast with peanut butter, and we drove 10 mins from our hotel to the drop-off point and got to the start area at about 7:10am. Waited in line for 20 mins for a porta potty, so I used that time to warm up. We squeezed ourselves into the crowded corral about 5 mins before the start and waited until our wave was let loose.

&#x200B;

**Race**

Miles 1-3: My goal pace was 9:09 to get the 2-hour HM time. I remembered all the posts/articles I read on the importance of starting out slow to get your body warmed up. Naturally, it’s pretty crowded the first mile or two, so it’s hard to go fast. I stayed on the edge and tried to go at what felt like an easy pace. Looked down at my watch after the first mile and saw I was at 9:21, much faster than I felt like I was going, but my legs and lungs felt good, so I went with it.  
Miles 4-7: I started to settle in. At this point, I started taking Honey Stinger chews (tried Gu gels when training but could not keep those down comfortably while running), popping a couple every 1.5 to 2 miles. I was stopping at most of the water stations, walking for 5-10 steps to sip before getting back into pace. This portion of the race felt really good. I looked down at my watch and realized that I could probably get a 1:55, which got me really excited to just keep this going as long as I could.  
Miles 8-10: Got stomach cramps halfway through mile 8. This slowed me down a little, but I just told myself to ignore the pain and focus on my breathing. The cramps subsided after about 5 minutes but would come back in waves. Started to slow down here, but I was still well on pace to get sub-2, so I kept trucking on.  
Miles 11-13: Bonk. This was the toughest 3 miles I think I’ve ever done. My pace drastically slowed down. Tried taking more chews, but even chewing was getting tiresome. The group of people I was keeping up with were now way ahead of me as more and more people jogged past me. I honestly didn’t think I was going to be able to finish; a lot of negotiation with myself, and definitely the most mentally challenging part. Halfway through the 12th mile, I decided to walk for 1 minute. I wanted to finish the race strong and thought a quick break would give me enough energy to push through the last 1.5 miles. Goal B was failed, but looking back at it, I did what I felt my body needed, so I’m okay with that. The last mile sucked, but I saw my wife and some friends about 0.5 miles from the finish cheering me on, and that gave me the boost to sprint out the rest of the way. Checked my watch when I crossed the line, and I was under 2 hours with some time to spare. 

&#x200B;

**Post-Race**

I wanted to fall on the ground and lay down immediately after finishing, but I also wanted some water and fuel. Grabbed a couple water bottles, some protein bars, and a banana. Found my friend to congratulate him on his finish, and we met up with our wives for hugs, pictures, and support to walk to the car. My legs were sore, but no knee or shin pain, so that was a win. Looking back at the race, even though I had to walk for a little bit of it, I’m proud I was able to redeem my-18-year-old-self and go 40 minutes faster. Next up is the OC Marathon in May! I think that one will be a “just finish” type of race for me. 😊

&#x200B;

This was a first-time experience for me – intentionally training for a race – so any words of advice would be appreciated as I look to the full marathon, and hopefully many more races.",running

### Race Info

The premise of the Groundhog Day Marathon is simple. Ever see the movie? This race will give you the opportunity to relive the same run several times. A total of 6 loops for the marathon (or 3 for the half) of approximately 4.4 miles on a certified course will have you feeling just a little case of deja vu. An outdoor race in Michigan in February seems like a crazy idea, but the Race Director, Don made it sound like such a fun challenge that I decided to give it a try.

### Training

I’m a 34 year old woman who has consistently been running for almost a year now. After two years of walking my dog 4-5 miles a day, and it never seeming to be enough to tire her out, we started jogging. And jogging turned into running, both with her and on my own. I haven’t followed a specific plan to this point, but tried to have 1-2 easier runs, a speed workout, and a long run (usually done with my friends) each week. I signed up for the half marathon in my hometown in May and wanted to use this race to get a pulse on my current fitness in order to actually choose a training plan and set goals that are reasonable and realistic. 

### Pre-Race

After enduring a few weeks of snow and negative degree temperatures, I was planning on an icy course. What we didn’t expect was that things would warm up so much that the snow would melt and the course would be flooded out. But Thursday afternoon we got an email explaining just that, along with a map of the new course- 12 loops of 2.2 miles for the full marathon and 6 for the half. I decided to check out the new course with my dog before packet pickup, and she was very happy to help as the unofficial track groomer via her stick collecting skills. 

On Thursday and Friday I tried to up the amount of carbs and liquids I consumed. I went to town on a bag of Uncle Jerry’s pretzels while fretting over what to wear. Ultimately I decided on regular leggings (not thermal/fleece lined ones), a long sleeve tech shirt, a vest, ear warmer, neck gaiter, and convertible mittens that turned into fingerless gloves. I got up early on Saturday, had some coffee and chocolate rice cakes with honey peanut butter for breakfast. My dog desperately tried to get in the car with me and I felt so bad about leaving her. Bribing her to go inside required breaking out the good treats, but it worked and I made the hour long drive, arriving at the race right as it was starting.

### Race

The start and finish area was pretty narrow and unfortunately the one spot where there was ice, so instead of fighting for space in the congested pack, I used the restroom one more time (yay thorough hydration!) and then started with the other stragglers. There were 423 people running the same 2.2 mile loop over and over all at different speeds. There were no pacers. This gave me the opportunity to see if I could find and hold a comfortably uncomfortable pace on my own. While I did occasionally check my watch, I tried to mostly go by feel and not obsess. This was made easier by the fact that it was hidden under a long sleeve shirt and gloves. 

It was about 25 degrees Fahrenheit, windy, and 95% humidity. I was very happy with my clothing choices. I didn’t feel hot, but I knew I was sweating as there was ice accumulating on my headband and in my hair. The course did have 2 aid stations (and every loop I was sure to say thank you to the incredible volunteers who brought the party despite the cold) but I’m used to running with a handheld. I went heavy on the electrolyte mix in hopes that the salt would help to prevent freezing. I took a gel during loops 2 and 4. During my fifth loop, I noticed that a lot of people started slowing down and walking. I had a fistful of gummy bears in my pocket that I tapped into in order to bribe myself not to walk. Mental toughness comes in all forms, right? During the 6th and final loop it came in the form of my dog. I had her walk across the chalk-marked finish line when we checked out the course, and reminded myself it was my turn now. Every step was one closer to getting home to celebrate with her. 

As much as I wanted to push myself for a fast finish, things were a bit too tight in the final stretch for me to realistically speed up. I got stuck behind a group that was walking and had to slow to a weird shuffle/waddle on the icy mud. Once we passed the ice, I was able to get around them, and still felt strong crossing the finish line for the 6th and final time. 

### Post-race

I checked my watch and it was a tiny bit short so I let it run while I collected my medal and went into the finishers tent. I finally stopped it and checked the text with my official chip time. 2:01:01.8. While I didn’t have a time goal for this race, I would be lying if I said I wasn’t a tiny bit disappointed at seeing how close I got but just missing sub-2. That feeling quickly disappeared when I remembered that a year ago, I didn’t run at all, and now I just ran a half marathon in 2 hours 1 minute and 1.8 seconds outdoors in Michigan in February with no pacers!

The Race Director and his team do an amazing job of making sure participants get their moneys worth. Instead of a race shirt we got hoodies and buffs. There were a ton of food and drink options in the tent as well as a Photo Booth. Because I participated in another one of their events, I got an extra challenge medal. When I gave my number at the awards table to pick it up, I found out I placed second in my age group! I was totally shocked and beyond grateful.

I stuck around for a bit to cheer for the other runners, but then I had to get home to the pup. After a quick shower we celebrated the only way my dog knows how to- by going on two (extra slow) walks, bringing my total mileage for the day to just shy of 20. We had pizza rolls for dinner, and then I slept like a rock for 10 hours straight. This morning I felt a little stiff, but drinking coffee out of my age group award mug while wearing my sweet new sweatshirt made me forget about anything feeling sore.

As crazy as it seems, the Groundhog Day Marathon was an absolute blast (times 6!). I smiled the entire time and I honestly cannot wait to sign up again next year! 

P.S. if after reading this you have any suggestions on a training plan that will work with the need to walk a dog 5 miles a day, please feel free to share. Thanks!!

1173,1707089497.0,Surf City Marathon Race Report: Marathon 2 of 12 in 2024,"### Race Information
* **Name:** Surf City Marathon
* **Date:** February 4, 2024
* **Distance:** 26.2 miles
* **Location:** Huntington Beach, CA
* **Website:** https://www.runsurfcity.com/
* **Time:** 3:14:48

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A | Have fun | *Yes* |
| B | Hit power-up signs | *Yes* |

### Splits

| 2 | Half -- 1:35:26 (7:17 min/mile)
| 3 | 21 mile -- 2:30:02 (7:09 min/mile)
| 4 | Total -- 3:14:48 (7:26 min/mile)

### Training
For background, I started running in 2020 and set the goal of running 12 marathons in 2024 and have completed one so far. Number two would be Surf City. 

With 3 weeks between Houston and Surf City, training was delightfully uncomplicated: one week of recovery runs, an 8-day build that included three quality sessions from Daniels' Running Formula and a mini-taper. Over the 3-week period, I averaged just over 50 miles per week, similar to my Houston build. 

### Pre-race
A week out, I started monitoring the weather forecast, and it wasn't looking good: steady rain, 15-20 mph winds, and morning temperatures in the mid-50's. While the rain didn't make an appearance on race day, the wind certainly did (more on that below). 

Driving in LA is one of my least favorite activities, and it took about 2.5 hours roundtrip to retrieve my bib Saturday morning. After that, I ate some ice cream and cookies and sipped on electrolytes throughout the afternoon to get some more carbs and sodium in.

The Surf City marathon starts at 6:30am, and it would be a 55-minute drive to one of the free parking lots from where I was staying, so I woke up at 3:30am, drank a cup of coffee and ate a bag of sour candy, my preferred pre-marathon fuel source. I made it to the parking lot just before 5am and was on the first shuttle, which left at 5:05am and dropped us off one block from the start at 5:15am. If you're looking to avoid paying for parking or the headaches of navigating street closures, I heartily recommend this option. 

### Race
A couple of things to note if you're considering the Surf City marathon. The pace groups are sparse (e.g., 3:10, 3:30, 3:50 etc.). That placed me in no man's land, as I  usually like to tuck into either a 3:15 or 3:20 pace group, and so I ran alone for much of the morning. 

The other thing I'll mention is the course design doesn't make it easy to get into a rhythm. Through the first 8 miles, the course takes you inland to Huntington Beach Park where there are frequent twists and turns and elevation changes. After that, the course transitions into a series of out-and-backs that bring you closer and closer to the bike trail along the beach. 

The last hairpin turn out-and-back just before mile 21 felt like a gut punch. When I completed the turn and sought to work back up to marathon pace, I was greeted by a nasty headwind, which set in motion one of the toughest 5-mile endings to a marathon that I can recall. It didn't take more than a minute before I blew a kiss farewell to any prospect of maintaining marathon pace. From miles 22 to 26, my pace crept into the 8:30's and 8:40's, and even that felt like it required threshold-type effort. I shuffled over the finish line somewhat disappointed that I didn't have the fitness to push through the wind in the final miles. 

### Post-race
In the finish area, volunteers handed out the standard set of refreshments: water, bananas, some savory snacks and some sweet snacks. 

Any time I get to run a marathon it's a fun way to spend a Sunday morning. And overall, Surf City was a convenient option for a February marathon, and I found it to be a well-organized event. But I didn't particularly care for the course, so this'll likely be a one-and-done for me.

**\*\*TRAINING\*\***  
In late October last year, I (23F) ran the Edinburgh Women’s 10k in 50:31 (race report here: https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/17iff6r/edinburgh\_womens\_10km/). I slightly missed my goal of sub-50, but wasn’t \*too\* disappointed because I’d been a wee bit ill in the lead-up. When I posted my race report on this sub I got a number of lovely comments, including one (by u/EPMD_) which used the phrase “you’ll probably have sub-45 in your future”. I almost laughed at this at the time — how could I be close to 45 if I couldn’t get below 50? — but as I ran in the lead up to Christmas it stuck in my mind for some reason.  

I trained a bit with a road running club in the weeks after, and continued doing 2-3 workouts in the gym. At this point, I could do a parkrun at around 24:30. In early December I found out my iron was low and was prescribed iron tablets, and also started making more effort to actually take my preventative asthma inhaler. I signed up for this 10k, knowing it was a flat course, hoping I’d break 50mins.

  
At Christmas (after a few glasses of wine), I confessed to my uncle (who is a brilliant multi-marathon-er, and now coaches) that I had my heart set on getting close to a 45 min 10k, and asked for tips. As well as that, he wrote me a whole training schedule for January.

  
Despite cutting my running from 5 days/week to 3-4, I got faster incredibly quickly. About 2 weeks into it, I ran a 23:20 5k within my tempo run. I’d attribute this to him dedicating more time to warm-ups (15-20 mins warm up and the same time cooling down with each tempo or interval run), and having me jog my recoveries rather than be still. Essentially, Tuesday was usually intervals, Thursday a Tempo run, and Sunday an easy long run.  
I also did parkrun towards the end — getting first a 22:07 (it was at this point I realised I might actually get close to 45mins), and then a 21:23 the week after. In the excitement, I bought myself a pair of alphafly 2s after finding a pair on offer.

  
**\*\*PRE-RACE\*\***  
Got the chance to volunteer at Parkrun the day before the race, went to collect my number, then spent most of the rest of the day trying to avoid stressing. More because of the anxiety, I ate a massive amount of pasta, bagels and crackers the day before, went to bed early, and got a long (although a little interrupted) night of sleep.

  
Race was scheduled for 10am — I woke up around 0730 and tried to force down some porridge with my morning coffee, but the pre-race nerves were getting to me and I couldn’t get much down. As soon as I stepped outside my heart sank: wind was fierce and the rain dreich… I could feel the hopes of sub-45 slipping away. Took a long and crowded bus to get to the green, got there 30 mins early, and immediately joined the line for the toilet (the race was generally well organised with a lovely team, but there \*definitely\* weren’t enough toilets). I queued for about 25 mins, sprinted out the portaloo, found my friend (22F), basically threw my hoodie and bag at her whilst switching out my trainers and failing to put a blister plaster on, and ran to the start line with 30 seconds spare. Because of my lack of breakfast, I quickly gulped down a gel as the gun went off.

  
**\*\*RACE\*\***  
The race was 2 laps of a 5k route.  We started along with a 5k race, and there were already half-marathoners (doing 4 laps) who had started at 9.

  
I was very conscious of not doing my classic and going off too fast. Tucked in behind another runner (I’m 5ft2 so this helps a lot with wind) and just tried to focus on my music and breathing. The course takes a wee figure of 8, then heads on an out-and-back section by the river.

  
After the first lap, the guy I’d tucked in behind ran through the tunnel to finish the 5k (rude). Grabbed a plastic cup of water and accidentally  threw it in my face. At this point I was just trying to hold on: was pretty much exactly on track for 45, but worried I’d be losing energy over the following lap.

  
7-9k was the hardest section. Pretty congested as there were a lot of half marathoners finishing at this point, and although my shoelace came undone at 8km I decided to not stop and tie it back for fear of losing time. Just wanted to get to 9k at something below 41, hoping I’d be able to kick it a tiny bit at the end. Nearly retched at 9k as I came towards the home straight.

  
Wasn’t till the last turn that I realised I’d actually do it. Came under the banner at 44:29!

  
**\*\*POST-RACE\*\***  
Pretty much immediately burst into tears. Got a pretty cool medal (there was water and other stuff being offered, I just didn’t take it), and then saw my friend! She gave me a massive hug (she knows how much I’d been hoping for this), despite how muddy I was. Took a few photos for prosperity, cried a few more times, and caught the train home.

  
As you can probably tell, I’m over the moon! Thank you so much to the supportive community here, I owe a lot to you guys <3. Have my sights set on another wee 10k in May, the Great North Run later this year, and maybe the Manchester Half!

1176,1707070729.0,Running influencers / YouTuber s,"Can’t see there’s been a discussion here for a while on peoples favourite running influencers. Thought this would be a useful place for people to recommend ones worth a watch/follow and what makes them good. 

My personal two favourites are: 

1)  FOD runner u/fodrunner 

Can’t recommend this guy enough. He’s a pretty prolific poster so very interesting to follow his running journey and training blocks. 
I’m a bit of a running stats geek, so if you’re in to similar this is the channel for you. He’s very into the science/ analysis side of things. His analysis of other runners training blocks are also interesting along with his race day videos and shoe reviews . 

He’s obviously a top club runner, better than most people can dream of but he’s not a sub elite and puts in a lot of hard work so somebody you can aspire to. Also as an unusually tall runner that angle is interesting.


2) Philly Bowden (@PhillyBowden)

Not sure if she would be classed as an elite or a sub elite runner? But of that category of runners I find her videos the most down to earth, fun and useful tips wise. Also enjoy her husband (@danielmoves) videos which come from a completely different angle, that of an average, new runner. 



Other people I’d recommend:

3) Nick Bester (@justalilbester)

Again sub elite runner. Very motivational. The best race day videos. Especially the ones he gives a talk over on.


4) Edd Budd (@EddBudd) 

The shoe review GOAT


5) The Athlete Special (@TheAthleteSpecial)

Fun channel from an American track athlete 


6) Kofuzi (@kofuzi) 

Great content from a runner with similar ability to myself 


7) Two running brooms (@tworunningbrooms)

Lots of parkrun videos. Like seeing different parkruns around the UK


8) Jog on with Harry Morgan (@thisisjogon) 

Motivational channel with lots of good content. 


9) The running channel (@runningchannel) 

Collection of influencers with some interesting content 


10) Floberg Runs (@flobergruns) 

Interesting to see a US perspective on marathon training. Well produced videos

In North America, there’s way more room between you and another person when on a run and perhaps it’s not the case when running through the streets and alleys of Tokyo. 

How do I go about getting in memorable kilometres on this trip? Will I need to only run in quiet suburb areas and nearby towns/cities or can I run around the busier areas of the city?

I don’t want to bother anyone as I know Japanese people really like to keep to themselves and I don’t want to disturb their peace. I’d also love if someone could recommend some routes or areas that are primo for running. I’m also in the market for a running buddy!

**Training**

 I (f23) signed up for this race in July before moving to Spain after beginning a bit of a running journey in May. My main reasoning was to have a specific goal work towards. I didn't use a specific training plan and was pretty inconsistent early on, but by December I was averaging about 15-20 miles/week, easy pace 11:00-11:30, hard 9:00-9:30. My goal was to build distance early on (for my own peace of mind). I had been running 10 mile long runs semi-regularly since September. 3 weeks out, I peaked at 27miles or so with my longest run being 11 miles with a 10:30 pace. 

I ran my long runs with a vest and a small flask of water (with a lil sea salt). I trained with both honey packets and fruit smoothie honey stinger gels on long runs, typically taking one or the other every 5 miles when running over 1:45 total.

I didn't focus on time much while training, it wasn't a priority. While training I worried about maintaining pace and not being completely derailed by my competitive (to a fault) tendencies. 10:30 pace or so ended up being a natural favorite, that I ran many of my runs at. It was the pace my body settled into without watching my watch so I figured it would serve as a good standard to aim for on race day.

2 weeks out from the race I injured my right calf while transitioning (poorly) to new shoes. Probably some sort of soleus strain, it affected my ability to push off while running and walking. Both legs were affected, but right is worse. It gets better after moving and worse after a period of resting. I saw the doctor and rested per advice. Because of this I pretty much did not taper at all and ran about 8 miles total in the last 2 weeks. I honestly considered not racing because I was worried I would hurt my leg further and/or not finish. 4 days out from race day and I ran a test run, 4 miles at race pace and at the end I felt great and decided to go ahead and try. I hoped to run about a 2:20 at first but the week before i readjusted my expectations and decided finishing was all i needed.

**Pre-race**

Morning of the race I felt insanely excited! Woke up at 6, ate some peanut butter oats and started stretching. My legs were pretty tight so i knew i needed to focus on getting everything nice and warm. I was still debating wearing a vest and bringing a water bottle as I had been for all my long runs but ultimately settled for my spi belt and taping my gels to the inside of my sports bra (genius). I left plenty early around 7:30 and jogged / skipped / hopped my way to the start line. Got there around 8am and felt late. Stood in line for the bathroom at a gas station for 30 minutes and then frantically found my way to my group. The energy was great, there were so many people, and I did my best to stay warm and moving until start time.

**Race**

At 9 am first wave took off. Once my group (the last one, #6) finally made it to the start line I spotted my friends cheering from the side and this definitely helped set the tone. My main goal was to go out SLOW which I managed with 10:30 being a comfortable long run pace that I'd practiced. I immediately noticed that my HR was significantly higher than usual from the gate so spent a while worrying about that. My heart rate regularly runs a lot higher than most benchmarks I see but this was unusual, especially for such a comfortable pace. It wasn't particularly obvious that it was so high either, if I hadn't been paying close attention I might not have noticed.

Miles 1-5 were definitely hard but I was prepared for that feeling and I knew I would find my groove. I was a little worried I was running too fast because of my HR but it felt sustainable so I pushed on. The course was beautiful and familiar which was a nice combo for kind of zoning out. It was also flat (as advertised) and pretty straightforward. I took a gel around mile 5 and grabbed sips of water/powerade from the (well supplied) stations every 5k. I was glad I didn't take my vest as it was nice feeling so light and there were luckily no mishaps getting hydration. I was surprised at how natural it felt to maintain such a consistent pace, i followed pace buddies when possible but let my body decide when to push past and when to let them go.

Miles 6-10 were incredible as predicted- I passed my friends on the sidelines again and was FLOATING. Honestly just felt so excited to be running again. I took my second gel at mile 10 along with a full cup of powerade, very quickly (too quickly?). At mile 11 my vision got a little foggy and my music started sounding distant and I suddenly realized I was lightheaded and immediately panicked (passing out is a big fear of mine). I quickly slowed to a walk and focused on my breathing, scoping out a spot to sit down if I needed. My heart rate was too high here. After about 20 seconds, I felt better and started to jog again, slower and paying closer attention to my watch. Miles 11-12 I was genuinely worried I wouldn't finish and anxiously checking my pulse. My body and legs felt great (mostly because I couldn't really feel them) but I was stressed about passing out which is not a normal feeling for me nor an issue I anticipated. We passed under the setas landmark and by the beautiful cathedral and I just focused on the feeling of crossing the line. I didn't want to push too hard and risk it even though it weirdly felt like I had plenty of gas in the tank, but at .10 left I opened up for the final stretch. The streets were wide and shaded at the end which was a welcome relief from the tight cobblestone streets of miles 11-12. The board read 2:19:xx as I crossed and I was ecstatic.

**Post-race**

 After crossing the line I felt like sobbing- I was overwhelmed physically and mentally and finishing was just like this incredible wave of catharsis. I found my friends and sipped on a (free) beer while we made our way home (remembered to stop my watch here). Once the endorphins wore off my legs definitely began hurting. I should have spent more time stretching right after. 3 days out now and I'm feeling better. I'm going to give my legs plenty of rest before I get back out there again. They need it. I'm very proud of my time- it's a time I hadn't considered feasible at any point in my training :) Already looking to find my next race!

Going forward I'd like to include more strength training to hopefully prevent future injury and help round out my leg muscles so that switching shoes in the future isn't so devastating.",running

1202,1706713540.0,An Epic Journey (In Progress): Looking for runners to join a Friend Running the Entire U.S. Perimeter!,"Hello all. A few months ago (October 9th, to be exact), one of our good friends/club athletes took off around the perimeter of us. He began in Cleveland, OH, went up to the southern border of Maine (that is the only part of the US he had to cut off due to weather and and a late start), then down the east coast all the way to Key West, FL, back up the gulf cost of FL and is now just crossing into TX from LA.

He's been out for almost 115 days now and has covered roughly 4500 of the 11-12k miles. He is fully self-supported pulling all of his gear in a kidrunner cart and survives off of donations, profits from a merch store we've created for him and the free meals that people have kindly donated to him at local cafes along the way.

We would love to get some running communities out to join him for a few miles, and I'm sure he would love the company. If you're interested, we've got a few ways to track him so you can meet up. Just let me know.

I am 22F, 5'3, 110lb, and the doctor made reference to me not having lots of fat to draw from for fuel because of my leanness, but I'm not sure if that impacts how I should be eating post-run. I also lift in addition to running a couple times a week. I enjoy an long, easy run of about 13-15 miles on the weekend. I do not eat anything before it, as I have always been one to exercise fasted out of preference, and I don't anticipate changing that.

1209,1706668929.0,Stinky Hats,"How do you clean your running hats? More specifically, how do I get the funky odors out without resorting to burning them? You know, the hats designed for running and sweating in that develop a strong funk, but are somehow too delicate for anything but handwashing? 

After running for several years without wearing hats I discovered the benefit of sweat-wicking running hats for cooler temps. I’m a big head sweater, so in the fall/winter/spring a hat that wicks sweat helps keep me dry and comfortable for the entire run. It’s amazing. However, even with rotating hats, rinsing them when I’m done running, and hang drying them they all smell funky. 

Help. My running buddies, wife, kids, and even my dog would appreciate it!

EDIT:
Thank you everyone for your suggestions! I have a few new ideas to try now, as well as not being as timid to put them in the washing machine. I only have a few running hats, since they're made for running, they are of course expensive, so I didn't want to take a chance of destroying one.",running

### Training
I've run one marathon before: the St. Jude's in Memphis, Oct 2022.  I ran a 3:14 in that one with some pretty bad training.  Tried to cram a 4 month program with peak of 78 weekly miles into 3 months (because I miscounted how many months I had available), got runners knee after one month, took one month off, and was only able to get one 20 miler in before tapering.  I was pretty surprised how well I did considering. Turned out 3:14 was a BQ time for me.  So, I decided to go ahead and sign up for the 2024 Boston.  Happened to barely make the cut.  Lucked out on that one.

To train for the 2024 Boston I wanted to do a real 4 month program leading up to the Houston, then a 3 month up to the Boston.  For the Houston I wanted to take it somewhat easy and peak at around 60 miles in a week. I figured I'd use the Houston as a training opportunity.   The training for the Houston went well. Living in the Houston area I don't get a lot of speed work in during the year due to the heat, so it's hard to know what my true marathon pace is. The last big week I was in Virginia though and it was nice and cool.  I was able to run a 10 miler at 6:48 pace (with 500 ft of elevation gain), then a 20 miler the next day with almost 2000 ft of elevation gain at about 8:30 pace. I felt strong at the end of that run, so was excited to see what I could do on a flat course like Houston.  

Unfortunately I got Covid 2 weeks prior to the race and did not fully recover (I tested negative but still had lingering effects).  My right ear was plugged up and it made me a bit dizzy.  Also I made the realllly smart decision to stop taking Zoloft cold turkey a few days before the race because it didn't seem to be doing anything for my anxiety, not realizing that vertigo and nausea were some of the possible symptoms of withdrawal. 
I was on the fence for a while but 2 days prior to the race I decided to just go ahead and run it, I didn't want to waste the opportunity but wasn't really sure how I'd feel the day of anyway.


### Pre-race
Had a hotel room  near the start.  Didn't get the greatest sleep but got enough.  Had a bagel, a banana, and some coffee.  Did my business, so figured I was prepared.  Still felt a little dizziness, but hoped it would wear off during the run (spoiler: stomach had other plans).  Since I had no idea how things were going to go I decided to pace myself off of feel for the first 6 miles, then reassess periodically.  It was pretty cold at the start, but really perfect weather for running once I warmed up.  Took a Maurten gel a min prior to starting and planned to run the first 10 miles with a Gatorade bottle full of Countrytime lemonade so I didn't have to navigate the first several watering holes.

### Race
Miles 1-6:
The start was really crowded for the first mile or so, had a lot of trouble getting around  people but felt okish.  First mile came in at 7:18, but I'd been slowed up some.  Next mile came in at 6:49 and I was a little worried I was running too fast.  Still, I felt alright, so decided to just keep going on feel. The next 4 miles were around 7 flat pace and I was pretty surprised and happy with how it was going.  Took another gel at 5 miles.  

Miles 7-13:
Decided I was feeling good enough to continue the pace and I'd reassess again at the half way point.  Miles were just ticking on by like clockwork.  At mile 10 I took another gel and finished off my lemonade but I was starting to feel queasy.  I hadn't felt great the whole time, but it was getting noticeably worse.
At the half way point I was still running well, but the stomach issues were really noticeable.  I passed the halfway at around 1:32, which was far better than I'd expected.  Aside from the nausea I was feeling strong. I thought I might even be able to get a negative split and, who knows?, maybe get sub 3???  A man can dream.  I was both sick and excited at the same time.

Miles 14-17:
Around mile 14.5 I realized I wasn't going to make the finish, I was going to have to stop for a bathroom break.  That little issue had come on pretty suddenly.  Around mile 16 I was getting really worried I'd have an accident on course if I didn't get to a pot-o-pottie ASAP.  Luckily I came across one in time.  That was 3 minutes lost, but I had been doing so well up to that point I was sure I'd get under 3:10 anyway maybe even 3:05, so no big deal.  Started up running again and immediately felt even more nauseous than before.  I tried to eat a rice Krispy treat but I couldn't even look at it without feeling like I was going to puke. I threw it aside and kept going. Tried to at least drink enough, but even that was trouble.

Miles 18-26
By mile 18 I was afraid I wasn't going to finish and thought about just stopping.  I was feeling really terrible now and the crowd noise was making it even worse for some reason. I just wanted to block everything out but i couldn't put my earbuds in because that also made things worse.  I had run so far and done so well up to that point that I convinced myself I could jog out the last 8 miles and still get a BQ and maybe a PR (and I still had hope for sub 3:10 at that point).  I didn't want to waste the work I'd put in, figured ""what's the worst that could happen?"".  I continued running at whatever pace would keep me from throwing up.
The last hour was just miserable and I was pissed that the thing holding me back was my stomach.  My legs and everything else felt fine.  Last 3 miles it was all I could do to keep under 8 min miles. I don't think I drank anything for the last 10 miles. I had just put my head down and embraced the misery knowing it would be worth it if I could get that BQ.  Crossed the line at 3:13, just happy I made it.  

### Post-race
I hadn't gotten any calories since mile 10, and I'd drank very little on the course.  I got a bottle of water and drank about half of it before having to toss it as it was upsetting my stomach further.  I tried to get some of the food offered but just couldn't do it.  Didn't hang around, went back to my hotel room and tried to relax for a bit before packing up and driving home.  Couldn't eat anything until around 6 hours later and even then it was tough to keep it down.  Didn't fully recover until the next day. 

### Final Thoughts
Well, in some ways the race was great.  Weather was great, people were great.  So many people came out to cheer us on I felt bad that I couldn't enjoy that.  The first 16 miles were better than I could have hoped for and I got another BQ in the bag if I want to run the Boston in 2025.  In other ways I'm worried about what this means for the 2024 Boston and future marathons.  I get motion sickness very easily and i hope the nausea was just from the lingering Covid symptoms and the Zoloft thing.  I do get a little queasy  at the end of my long runs at times, even when I'm fully healthy though.  At the end of the Memphis one I wasn't feeling great but I attributed that to over-exertion.  Over the next couple of months I'm going to try out some other food and maybe less sugary drinks too.  I don't think my stomach is doing well with all the sweet stuff, I'll probably focus on electrolyte pills rather than getting them from drinks.  Will probably try salted potatoes or something to get a break from the sugar.  Still looking forward to the Boston though.  Hopefully I can run a clean one.

1211,1706631739.0,Olympic trials questions,"I was wondering how they decide the line up at the start for the Olympic trials as I figure the winners are done by gun time and not chip time? 

I assume then they line up based on fastest qualifying times in front?

My understanding is that the women have unlocked 3 spots and anyone who has run under 2:26 in the eligibility period will be eligible for the games. The men have only unlocked 2 spots and anyone who has run under 2:11:30 will be eligible, but if someone were to run under 2:08 at the trials (unlikely?) they would unlock a 3rd spot?  Why are there 2 different Olympic standard times- one for eligibility for games it seems and one to unlock spots? Is my understanding correct?

1212,1706636605.0,Acclimating to running in more polluted air (higher AQI index). Any tips or advice?,"I recently moved from a small town with great air quality to a large city with not so great AQI standards. In the couple of weeks I've been here I've already gotten sick twice with upper respiratory infections. I don't attribute this entirely to poor air and running outside (it seemed like everybody was sick over the holidays) but I'm sure it hasn't helped me either. I'm one of those people who rarely gets sick.

I've just starting marathon training for a race in late April so not running outside is tricky. Asides from running on a treadmill on those really bad days (AQI>100-150), is there anything I can do to minimize the impact both during and after my runs? Does running with a mask do much? What about other simple home remedies like going into the sauna post-run or rinsing my sinuses with a neti pot? I've even thought of buying an oxygen tank on Amazon (lol).

I think I'll eventually get acclimated but I'm open to hearing from others on any home remedies that have helped.",running

Not sure if the first one still exists, but instead I'm seeing [AI Endurance](https://aiendurance.com) more often. I've enjoyed using TAO in the past, particularly because it motivates me to try different kinds of runs, but I also like looking at alternatives. After some weeks of checking suggestions in AIE and TAO, I feel like AI Endurance is only planning endurance runs (the name gives it away) while there is more variety with TAO (still mostly assessments, though).

1225,1706447760.0,boosting mental confidence for race pace,"I'm currently a couple months out from my second half marathon. Training has been fantastic. The only part I feel like I'm lacking is mental - hoping some more experienced runners can chime in their thoughts.

I set myself a goal for a 1:59:59 (lol) which from my training should be achievable, but I'm having a tough time wrapping my head around sustaining that pace for two hours. I think a lot of this may have to do with the fact that I've primarily done easy runs and although I'm ecstatic my base pace has gotten faster, the confidence isn't quite there yet for race day.

I've begun incorporating speedwork via a dedicated training plan while a bulk of my miles remain in z2. There are progression runs, intervals, and race pace runs. But two hours at race pace still seems like such a long time compared to training runs, and obviously I'm not about to do a pre-half-half just to see if I can maintain that pace, lol. Any tips? Tricks? Training ideas to boost confidence? Words of tough love? Really would appreciate it.

**Training**

*So quickly, I started running back in February last year. When I first started I weighed around 380 and had already lost around 40-ish pounds from my highest known weight. This weekend I did my first half marathon down 180 pounds from that highest weight.* 

*Note on how I've lost weight: I have dramatically changed my relationship with food and have remained in a caloric deficit while also doing some moderate strength training on top of the obvious cardio. I don't track macros specifically but I try my best to eat as much protein and fiber as I can and I'm not afraid of consuming carbs especially with how much running I do.*

In early October 2023 I decided to sign up for the Rose Bowl Half Marathon. I had followed a training plan for the first race I ever did (a 4.2-miler in April 2023) so I had an idea of how to space out workouts and decided to kind of go on my own for the half marathon. Only right now as I type this do I realize that may have been a poor decision. But I guess it ended up being just fine in the end. 

By the end of training I had settled in to a routine of running consecutive two days followed by a day of rest where I would often still go for a long walk. My workouts would either be some Zone 2 work where I tried to spend at least 45 minutes in my Zone 2 heart rate while jogging/walking to keeping the heart rate low, 8x400m intervals, a workout dedicated to climbing hills and my long runs.

I felt good progress being made in every workout and didn't ever feel any significant pain so I felt like the routine worked pretty well for me. My longest run of 11 miles before race day was difficult but I didn't feel like I had fully spent quite everything which gave me plenty of confidence. 

On the day before the race, I went for a 20-minute shakeout in the rain which was also initially forecast for raceday. I felt extremely strong on the run and was very confident heading to bed the night before.

**Pre-Race**

I slept at a friend's house the night before and got up out of bed at 4:45 to make my breakfast and get ready. I ended up getting only 6.5 hours of sleep which is a little less than I hoped but the quality of sleep was pretty good. My plan was to use the shuttles to get to the start line at the Rose Bowl since we were being greatly discouraged from parking at the stadium. 

This plan did not go well as first, I left my friend's house much later than originally expected. This was followed by me not being able to figure out how to get to the shuttle stop thanks to the roads already being closed for the race. 

Eventually I gave up and found a spot 1 mile away from the shuttle and speed walked to the stop. I got on the bus maybe 30 minutes before race start. When I arrived I tried using a port-a-potty but felt I didn't have enough time so gave up to try and get some stretching in before lining up for the race. 

**Race**

I lined up a little further back than I should have. I was trying to hit 2:30 and I was standing nearby the 2:45 pace group but I figured things would spread out enough for me to get where I was supposed to be eventually and it would be better for me to start slower anyway. 

Of course, I didn't start slow at all. I went out much too fast and despite me telling myself to slow down multiple times I just couldn't find the half marathon effort I knew would work best. That being said, I felt phenomenal for really the majority of the first 9 miles or more. 

As you can see in my splits, I did start to slow down after a much too fast fifth mile but I was still feeling good. I ended up taking three Gu gels I brought myself and had on a hydration backpack that I used plenty on the course. I took the electrolyte drink at every aid station I could. I was running for a good majority of the race with the 2:25 pace group and continued feeling good while keeping up with the leaders. 

Around mile 10.5 I really started hitting a wall thanks to a number of rolling hills in the final stretch of the race. I slowed down dramatically and began to watch the 2:25 group slowly get further and further from me. This was devastating to watch. Finally in the 12th mile, I had to stop to walk for a little. One of my goals was to jog the entire course and I nearly made it there but I feel OK with listening to my body and taking a short walking break when I did. 

The rest period allowed me to find a (somewhat) comfortable jogging pace again for the final mile. Just before entering the Rose Bowl for the finish I finally saw my girlfriend and my friends who came along to watch and that pushed me over the finish line, crying.

I stopped for a moment looking around in the historic Rose Bowl Stadium. I remembered how far I've come and how much work it took to get to be standing where I stood. I've been bought into this belief for a little while now, but standing there really solidified deep into my bone marrow that we can do anything if we can find the desire to set our mind to it. 

Also of note, there did not end up being a bit of rain. The weather was just about perfect for a run. 


**Post-Race**

I was feeling pretty beat after exiting the stadium and didn't realize until I got to my friend's house to shower just how drenched in sweat all of my clothes were. My friends suggested we go to a Korean spa in LA and let me tell you, that felt incredible after a long run. 

I'm already back running again a few days removed from the race and I'm so excited to continue this journey and hopefully as I continue keeping my fitness up and as I lose more weight I'll see more and more progress running. I'm not sure when, but I do think a full marathon is in the future.",running

1248,1706109510.0,Seeking crosstraining discussion! How does crosstraining for aerobic fitness work? Any tips for building a crosstraining plan to help with running?,"Something happened due to overtraining that means I can’t run for a while, but I can crosstrain. Will prob be around 4-8 weeks. I’m wanting to learn more about how crosstraining for fitness works, particularly when used in place of running.  
Firstly, is heart rate / HR zones the most important thing? I normally cycle and run, but have not done either in 1.5 weeks due to that thing that happened. Today I cycled 30 mins to work and my heart rate was 155 on average!! Normally it’s below 120 on that cycle. 155 is what my heart rate would be on a steady run typically!  
My question is: Is 30 mins cycling at 155 HR average the same, in terms of fitness benefits, as running for 30 mins at the same heart rate? If I cycled for say, an hour a day, and made sure my heart rate was around 150-160, would that keep my fitness up in the same way that running would?  
Also, I’ve tried swimming, but I can’t seem to get my heart rate above 120 bpm average. I’m just not a good swimmer, so I can’t really go fast enough to feel out of breath.. Idk if that makes sense, but every time I try to swim faster I just end up almost drowning. Is there any benefit aerobically to swimming gently for an hour, or should I focus on the cycling where I can control my heart rate more and add in resistance/sprint intervals on the stationary bike?  
My final question is - does anyone have any resources in terms of building a crosstraining plan? Any websites you’ve used etc? Would also love to hear experiences from others about crosstraining, what worked, what didn’t, how your fitness was pre-and-post thing that meant you had to take a break from running.

1255,1706038154.0,The Criteria By Which You Evaluate a Running Shoe?,"I'm identifying the specific criteria by which people evaluate running shoes they try on.  
The most important is ""comfort."" If you can't run your first mile in the shoe, you won't run 500. But comfort is very subjective so I'm trying to distill what exactly what means.  
Here's the factors I think make up the characteristics of the shoe:

* Responsiveness
* Weight
* Versatility (Can the shoe do tempo and long run?)
* Cushion
* Upper - Breathability and flexibility
* Stability

The other factors come down to biological factors. If you have a wide foot, a narrow shoe won't work for you.  
Am I missing other qualitative factors?",running

**Training**

A lot of the training I did for Houston was training for the South Texas International Marathon – my race report is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/18beimf/south\_texas\_international\_marathon\_pr\_but\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/18beimf/south_texas_international_marathon_pr_but_not/)

After STIM I took three days off then did a relatively easy extension of my existing training block.  I peaked with a 20 mi run three weeks after STIM and three weeks before Houston.  I duplicated my taper weeks for STIM as well.

I wasn’t expecting a big improvement with a month and a half interval between the two races; that time would be almost exclusively taken up with recovering from STIM then tapering for Houston.  I decided after Houston that I was not going to take a water pack in my running vest and that I was going to use Powerade gels instead of Gus.  I tested both (simulating water stations by only drinking from the pack every 2 miles) on the 20 miler.

I entered the race weekend with the goal of Pring (faster than 3:17:48) with the stretch goal of BQing (3:10), which I set after running Houston last year (3:36:44).  I wasn’t expecting to BQ, but if I found something new on race day I didn’t plan on saying no.

**Pre-race**

I began carb-loading on the Wednesday before the race, a day earlier than I did for STIM.  On Saturday I drove from San Antonio to Houston, grabbed my packet at the expo, and bought a running cap (I try and get a visor or cap for every marathon I run).  I was obsessively checking the weather throughout Saturday because a cold-front was coming in and it looked like the race would be much colder than any of the conditions I trained in.  After a time, I stopped checking because I had gear to cover whatever temperature it was and it was just keying me up (I settled on shorts, a long-sleeve tech shirt, and gloves).  I had a home-cooked pasta dinner with my parents then went to bed around 9:30 PM.

I woke up at 4 AM, had a cup of coffee and a packet of pop-tarts (my traditional pre-race food).  After checking the forecast one more time in case nature threw me a curve ball, I showered to finish waking up and got dressed.  I threw on an old sweatshirt and my wife drove me to the starting corrals around 6:15.

**Race**

As the elites were let out on the course I ditched my sweatshirt and started shuffling forward with the crowd.  I started towards the front of corral A and was able to get a good start close to the 3:10 pacers (a BQ pace for me).  In the crush at the start I immediately lost sight of the pace group – I figured I’d just run my own race and got to work.  For the first two miles I got up to speed as the initial crowd thinned and the streets opened up as we left downtown.  By the time we pivoted on Waugh I was up to speed and started ticking off the miles.  I was going a little faster than I planned, but I felt good so let it ride.

Close to the 10k mark the marathon course split off from the half on Mandell – the street where my parents live.  My dad ran the Houston marathon many times back in the day (much faster than me!) – I gave him a quick hug when I spotted him and my mom on the median cheering me on.  By this point I had found the 3:10 pacers and was hanging out in their general vicinity.

As I entered West University and headed towards the half-way mark at Westpark I felt great and decided to hold the same pace.  This was a contrast to STIM – at the half there I could tell I wasn’t going to be able to hold on and slowed down.  At the Galleria the pack started spreading out and I kept powering forward – I’d occasionally slow down to take a gel or get water from a station but I kept the pace group in sight.

By mile 19, as the course passed under 610 on Memorial I started to feel a bit of a twinge in my legs.  I wasn’t cramping, but it felt like I was going to in a few miles.  I took my last gel fifteen minutes earlier than planned and slowed my pace slightly in the hope that I’d avoid hitting the wall.  I took a pickle shot about ten minutes later as well.

When I turned on Shepard onto Allen Parkway and the course’s final 5k my legs started feeling very tight.  I kept turning over my pace and splits in my head and realized if I could just manage a 7:10 pace for the final stretch I’d BQ.  I sped up briefly but it just wasn’t going to happen – upping the pace took me closer to cramping and I wanted to finish on my feet.  If I held on with a slower pace I was certain to PR.  Trying for a BQ (one I wasn’t planning on) would most likely end with me blowing up and snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.

For the final half mile I pulled the pin and got up to a 7:00 pace.  Looking back I’m not sure how I managed it – as I crossed the finish line I nearly collapsed.

**Post-race**

I staggered into the George R Brown elated with a new PR (I later found out I had two PRs as I ran my fastest ever half as well!).  I grabbed my swag (I like that Houston gives you the finisher’s shirt and mug only after you actually finish) and took advantage of the complimentary massage offered to the marathon runners.  At this point I could barely move but made my way over to the Hilton to meet my wife and son.  When I got there I finally sat down – my legs began twitching uncontrollably and I started shivering.  After about ten minutes I felt somewhat normal and we had a nice lunch at the hotel restaurant.  Following that was the ¾ mile walk back to our hotel, a glass of wine, and a warm bath.

I didn’t quite manage to BQ this season, my goal leaving Houston last year, but came close.  Honestly when I realized I’d probably need to come in five minutes below the BQ time to make it, in my heart of hearts I relegated the goal from this season to longer term.  The work I put in garnered me multiple PRs and next year I won’t need to shave more than twenty minutes off my PR to BQ – a goal I am going to attain.

### Training
After getting back into running for 9 months (Running 4-5 times a week consistently), I decided to give my first marathon a go. The plan I used was the Advanced Plan from Hanson's Marathon Method (HMM). I stuck to the plan very strictly for all 18 weeks, but adjusted the day off depending on my week. Usually it was a Tuesday or Sunday. I didn't miss a workout, and hit all the mileage, except for maybe 1-2 miles on the last few peak weeks. This was my first marathon so I had no idea what kind of pace I was going to be able to commit to, but the HMM book had a very helpful guide. According to my mile time trial, the book suggested I was going to be able to hit a sub 3:25 marathon, which seemed mind boggling at the beginning of training. I followed the paces it gave for the workouts based on that time, and decided to dial in a 7:45 pace for the marathon pace workouts. 

About 11 weeks into the training, I ran a 5 mile Turkey Trot race (I switched out a workout that week with this race). I decided to just go for it and let it rip, since a lot of people online suggested it shouldn't mess with training too much. I was shocked to finish with a 6:20/mile 5 miler with a time of 31:53. This race really showed me how much this training plan already improved my fitness. Even though the plan didn't recommend it, I was eager after this to slightly increase the paces in my training to see if I could get a 3:20 marathon time. I decreased my ""Strength"" workouts to about 7:20/mile, my marathon pace to 7:35-7:40/mile, and my long runs to 8:05-8:10.

### Pre-race
Disney Races require an early morning, since their races begin at 5:00am. I was up at 2:00am. Took some Maurten 320 mix, graham crackers with peanut butter and honey, 1 banana, and a nutri grain bar. I had 2 scoops of electrolyte mix and a cup of coffee to get the bowels moving. I felt great before the race, but we had to sit tight in the corrals for 30 minutes before the race which isn't the most fun thing in the world. I had a lot of water, and would've liked to use the restroom one more time but couldn't. I ended up not using the bathroom during the race as I guess my body worked itself out with the water stored up. I'm not for sure how that works physiologically lol.

I took with me 6 gels: 3 SIS, 1 Gu watermelon (Caf), 1 Maurten (Caf), and 1 Go Gel. I get bored easily if you can't tell. I took one every 4 miles. I also took some electrolyte chews and took 2 every 8 miles.

### Race
If you haven't run a Disney race before, I highly recommend it - especially if you're a fan of anything Disney related. I chose this marathon as my first one because I thought if I'm going to suffer, I might as well do it at the ""Happiest Place on Earth"". A lot of Run Disney people suggested to just go for fun, and not shoot for a time. But I had just spent 18 weeks training and I wanted to give it my best shot. If I had to run it again, I would definitely do it as a fun run - but I have no regrets this time around with going for a sub 3:25. The amount of characters they have on the course, and fun entertainment was pretty much non stop. Running through all of the parks was incredible and surreal. Magic Kingdom, and Animal Kingdom respectively were especially magical. Running on Main Street USA with a crowd of people cheering you on is something every runner needs to experience.

One annoying thing about Run Disney races is they allow their club members to be in Corral A, despite if they have a qualified time to be in that corral. Because of this, it made the first 6 miles of the race incredibly difficult. I had to weave through a bunch of joggers and walkers for the first mile, which really caught me off guard. After that, I slowly had to pass probably 200-300 people who were running about 8:30-11:00/mile paces. I wasn't able to hit my proper splits because of this. I was shooting both 15 seconds too fast, and 15 second too slow. In addition, I added about .20 of a mile in this process. Mentally, I was afraid I already screwed up.

I got in a groove on mile 6, as I found somebody who was running around my pace. We hit MK, and I got an instant energy boost from the crowd. I was able to finish out the miles into the halfway point with the proper splits.

I decided if I felt relatively good, I would pick up the pace at this point, which I did. And since I had tracked some extra mileage already, I knew I would have to finish faster than my race pace to get my goal. I started dialing up to 7:30/mile. I started to hit a threshold, and so I just tried to keep my mile splits under 7:40/mile. It started to pour down rain at mile 18, which was refreshing at first, but it got swampy quick. It continued until mile 20. I this point I had energy and no cramps. So I said ""Let's just see how fast these legs can move for 6 miles!"". I worked down a progression mile by mile from 7:35 to 6:39 on the last mile, and finally 6:12 for the last 800 meter sprint. I was shocked by how much energy I had, but I can only give credit to the training plan for training me properly. If anything, I raced way too conservatively and could've held a faster time overall! But I have no regrets.

### Post-race
We walked (Well shuffled and stumbled) around Disney for 4 days which helped with recovery. I took 5 days off running completely, and have started ramping up the miles the last few days. I'm so happy I decided to do the Disney Marathon, and I cannot recommend the Hanson Marathon Method enough. 18 weeks is a big commitment, but so is running a marathon! If you put in the work, you will get the results you want.

I'm happy to discuss any questions about either the HMM and Disney Marathon in the comments :)

1276,1705759210.0,Pace Workouts - Separate or within the long runs?,"I'm interested to hear peoples opinions on how to programme pace runs. There seems to be 2 schools of thought, separate them and have them as the workout or incorporate them into the long runs.


I ran a marathon last year and was running them separately on consecutive days. I thought it may be better to incorporate them into my long runs so I have only 2 'hard' runs in the week (speed/long) vs 3 'hard' runs (speed/pace/long). Of course this means my 'long run' would be more intense but one less had session in the week might balance that out. I also like the idea of running my pace on tired legs, i feel this might prepare me better for the race.

Thoughts?",running
1277,1705756273.0,How I recovered from runner's knee,"So I hope I am safe to say that I have more or less fully recovered from a classic ""runner's knee"" (or IT-band syndrome). Since I found a lot of help from other people's stories here (mentally, seeing that other people had overcome it, and more practically how they've done it) I though I should contribute myself. It is a quite long text to give the full context, but I hope it could help anyone struggling. 

Backstory: I've been running on and off for the last four years. It started when I more or less replaced gym strength training with running, and ran 5 km three times a week for some time. Over the course of 1.5 years this developed into periods where I ran up to 100 km each week. The only negative side effect being the psychological, especially burning a lot of calories. No injuries.  

Had a period of a few moths where I stopped training, and after that I started strength training at the gym once again, no more running. After a few months on the gym, I started running again, but as compared to my previous running period I continued going to the gym. Peaked around 60-70 km at most some weeks. No injuries.

Another period of a few months (4 to be exact) followed that, and I basically just went to work and came home to lay on the couch. Physical decline and I decided I need to start training again. Since I wasn't eager to go to the gym, I decided to go for running only. Did a test run and decided I still had the endurance to start at 20 km the first week, then increase with 10 km each week up to about 60 km.

First week went fine (20 km total). The first run on the second week (30 km) I had to use an old pair of shoes that were really worn down and that I hadn't used for more than one year. After running 3.5 km on a 6 km run, I noticed the pain in my knee for the first time. Grew larger during the remainder of the run but I ignored it (mistake). Had encountered different kinds of pain during my running career and these were always temporary. Pain went away after the run but I still felt it when walking down stairs.

During the third week (40 km total) the pain always kept coming back after 3-4 km, and when walking down stairs after the runs. It became more and more severe. During the last run of week three I could barely run at the end of the session. Could barely walk down stairs. Pain noticeable when walking normally. Started reading on the internet and Runner's knee felt like a likely diagnosis (more specifically, the lowermost part of the IT-band on the outside of the knee).  

Ordered a new pair of running shoes (since I had put about 900 km in my current ones), decided to use the spinning cycle for a week and then rest completely for a week. Pain went away when walking down stairs, and felt comfortable in started running again. Blasted away with 9 km on the treadmill with 2 degrees incline. Did not feel any pain when I was running, but the moment I got of the treadmill the pain was very sharp and I had trouble walking. Back to square one.

Started researching even more and got to the conclusion that I could not simply rest to fix the problem. Something was currently off with either my flexibility or strength that caused my running patter to cause the pain. Either I had to build up my mileage more slowly or strengthen/stretch the muscles that could affect the pattern. But I guess slowly building up the mileage is a way of strengthening the involved muscles as well. However I decided to do both. I also noticed that my cadence had been lower (around 150 as compared to 160) these weeks as compared to my old running history. So my plan was to also increase my cadence when I got back to running since this supposedly lower the loads on your knees.

I started doing three strength sessions at the gym a week (the Stronglifts 5x5 program (squat, deadlift, bench, press, row), with weights that felt comfortable but still a little challenging). This is very similar to the kind of strength training that I had done before/during my periods of running in the past, and during which I did not have any pain. I also did three sessions with 4x4 Norwegian intervals on the spinning bike each week, but this was mainly to improve my endurance while not running. Some people say spinning can trigger the pain for them, but it did not do that for me. 

I also stretched once every day, mainly before bed. Exercises would include:

* Sitting hamstring stretch. Sit on the floor, reach for your toes.
* Standing hamstring stretch. Stand on one leg, put the other food on the sofa/bed and bend it slightly while bending at your hips.
* Sitting glutes stretch. Sit on the floor, cross one leg above the other legs and pull its knee towards your chest. 
* Standing glutes stretch (standing pigeon pose). Would put the foot on my kitchen counter. 
* Split stretch with foremost leg bent 90 degrees to target psoas and the TFL muscle.
* The split stretch with foremost leg bend 90 degrees, but using one hand to grab the foot of the rear leg and stretch the quads.
* Runner's knee stretch at 05:30 in this video (it also shows the pigeon pose at 07:40): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDhKVtkfnsg&embeds\_referring\_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2F&source\_ve\_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb\_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDhKVtkfnsg&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title)
* Calf stretch. 
* Occasionally I would use a tennis ball to release my TFL, which were really tight. 
* I did some clamshell excercise, but quit these after two weeks. 

After about 4 weeks I decided to try the treadmill again. I did 1 km at 4 degree incline without any pain. Following that I did three sessions every week, increasing with 1 km every run. When I got to 5 km I did two sessions at that distance. Last session was 6 km. Still no pain. Next two will also be 6 km. Then four at 7 km, 5 at 8 km and so on until 10 km. I hope I am just not lucky, and that I can continue to increase my mileage slowly. At slightest sign of pain, I will reverse back to the previous distance. I do the full stretching session before each run (not including the TFL release). I've managed to keep my cadence at 165-170 which felt a bit strange in the beginning, but surprisingly soon it became natural. 

This far it seems to work. It is probably overkill and I could probably have spared a lot of time by going to a PT to find the exact root cause. I am kinda cheap though, so I'll avoid that. Maybe it would have been enough to just ramp up the mileage very slowly and skip the pure strength training. But in the end, the extra time I put into exercises that might not actually attack the root cause of my particular Runner's knee are making me stronger and more flexible in other ways, and I don't see any harm in that. It is a way of spreading my bets I guess.

When I’d go for my long runs (3-4 hours) my ex would hate it. He didn’t get it. He would join me for 5ks and I really enjoyed having that time together. 

The other day I ran a 10k with a guy I’m seeing and it was so refreshing. Running at a conversational pace and I finally understood those people who join running clubs. It actually made me miss having someone beside me on my solo run.

I have women’s size 7-8 feet so they also need to come in small sizes otherwise my toes come out of the slots 😆

Can’t remember all the brands I’ve tried, but two of them are Orrinsports and a brand I guess is called “Fasot Women Toe Socks 5 Finger Cotton Wicking Athletic” on Amazon. Both were just too thin, but they were decent quality and the Orrinsports were slightly thicker",running

**Event:** 

Jekyll Island Marathon, Jekyll Island, Georgia. 

26.2, 13.1, and 10K distances. 

[Race website.](https://jekyllislandmarathon.com/)

**Travel:** I am a Georgia native, so the 3 hour drive wasn't a big deal. It's $10 to get onto the island, and there's a little bit of a wait at the pay station. 

**Lodging:** We stayed at the Westin- the hotel sponsor for the race. The hotel was very nice, and our stay was pleasant. However, our friend Beth stayed in the hotel next door and it was around $150 cheaper, just as nice, and I could see it from my window. Not a major deal, but worth noting. 

**Packet Pickup:** Packet pickup was well-organized, and only took a minute. It was located in the Westin hotel. The 'packet' was literally just your shirt, and your race number. One person in our group had ordered a ""Jekyll Marathon 24"" race hat and was refunded because they ""didn't come in."" So, there's that. 

**The Race:** We walked to the start line from the hotel. The weather was overcast and around 42 or so at the start. Porta pottys were plentiful, and we decided to hit the restroom one last time just in case. This put us at the rear of the starting pack of around 3-400 folks. There was a bit of a bottleneck at the start, but we ran our first mile at the 9:15, which was only about 30 seconds slower than we'd planned. 

The itinerary had the Marathon starting at 7:30, and my Garmin shows 7:30 exactly as my start time. After the first mile or two the pack had spread out and we never felt crowded or cramped. 

The aid stations were spaced out every 2 or 3 miles with plenty of volunteers offering water, powerade, and gels. I hadn't tried that particular brand of gel before, so I used the ones I'd brought, but I suspect you could carry no gels or hydration and fully rely on the aid stations. They were impressively consistent. 

The course itself was very very flat, and absolutely beautiful. It's all road, paved trail, and sidewalks except for a couple wooden bridges and one section of hard-packed sand that lasts maybe 8-12 strides. The views along Driftwood beach were really something special, and found myself genuinely thankful for a healthy body and the opportunity to experience this event in this beautiful place. 

I didn't have any complaints about the course, although it's worth mentioning that the last 5 or 6 miles we saw an increase in pedestrian traffic. The course loops back around onto the paved bike course, and there were some groups of folks either walking or biking very slowly that we had to navigate. Not a major issue, but the event doesn't have that stretch of the course all to itself. This was my first marathon so I don't really have a point of comparison, but I was really impressed with the event and I'll absolutely run it again!

**Personal Background/Performance:**

M, 41, 6'4 225lbs. 

I'd been a casual 5/10K runner in my teens up until my early 20's. I'd gotten casually into Crossfit in my late 30's, and could typically still run a 5k, but I'd let casual drinking turn into heavy drinking and I'd gotten up to around 270lbs. 

July 10, 2023 I woke up hungover and decided I'd had enough. August 2nd I started 75 Hard. In August , I completed two sprint distance Triathlons, and finished my 75 Hard program with an Olympic Tri on October 15th. I completed a local half marathon on Nov 4th. My goal was sub-2 and I ran it in 1:51:00 flat.  I knew Jekyll was coming up in January, but I didn't think I had time to train. 

I printed [this 12-week marathon training plan](https://www.shape.com/fitness/training-plans/your-12-week-marathon-training-plan) and built backwards from Jan 14th as race day. I used the plan as an outline, and typically added a mile or two to the long run. A friend of mine had been a big motivator/mentor in training for the Tri's. He was running Jekyll as well, and we did nearly all of our interval/long runs together. I didn't do the speed work listed in the plan, but usually we'd do one run a week between 6-10 miles with an easy/hard interval element built in. Instead of 20 as the longest run, we did 23. I did additional strength training sessions 3-5 days a week. 

Our goal was to stick together the whole race, and finish sub-4. I could edit and list the full splits, but basically miles 1-20 was around an 8:45 pace, and 21-26 were 9:15ish. We finished with an average pace of 8:58, total time of 3:56:29.

I alternated Go Gels and Maurten Caf 100's 5 mins before, and at miles 4/8/12/16/20. I never bonked or hit a wall, but I was getting a little sore the last few miles. I ran in Hoka Rocket x2 race shoes and was thankful for the extra padding the last few miles. 

Overall it was a fantastic experience, and if you're thinking about doing the Jekyll Island Marathon feel free to drop any questions and I'll answer as best I can! Thanks for reading!

1312,1705346438.0,"Disney World Dopey Challenge ""Race Report""","A bit of a preface going in, I guess. I ran my local marathon in November (Richmond, VA) and finished at 3:51:48 and did a pretty easy and flat 50k a couple of weeks later on December 2. After the November marathon, the only ""training"" I really did was just focusing on increasing my mileage - I didn't really do any sort of speedwork, just a lot of longer mileage days and just increasing my overall weekly mileage in general. 

I went into doing Dopey with the intent of getting a PR in one race (much to my wife's chagrin), and thought that the 5k would be my best bet. Turns out I was wrong.

**Day 1, 01/04/2024 - Disney 5k**

If you aren't familiar with Disney races, they split everyone up into corrals (A through F) and each corral has several waves of runners in them. I didn't realize this because it was my first time doing any races at Disney, and didn't think *too* much of being placed into corral C for the 5k and 10k and corral A for the half and full marathons. 

By the time I actually started, there were so many people already out in front of me that I was constantly dodging people walking, stopping, taking pictures, etc. and realized that my goal of getting a PR in the 5k just wasn't happening. Going into this, my 5k PR is 21:01, and I managed to finish this race at 23:32. 

Splits: 7:45, 7:16, 7:04 and the last bit was ran at a 6:07 pace

**Day 2, 01/05/2024 - Disney 10k**

I went into this race with full intent to get my PR here. I got into my corral early, was in the very front of the first wave, and despite still being in corral C, I was able to run a quicker race than the day before. There were still a lot of people stopping randomly, walking 4 or 5 wide, and all of that, and I had to run on the grass many times just to avoid it. 

Despite all of that, I managed to hit my goal for this race. My PR going into this was 46:10 that I set in April of 2023. Both of my 5k splits were faster than the actual 5k the day before, and I finished the 10k at 44:28, which put my time at 110th place overall. I was, and still am, pleased with this one.

Splits: 6:47, 7:32, 7:01, 7:11, 6:54, 6:54, and a 6:10 pace to finish out

**Day 3, 01/06/2024 - Disney ""Half"" Marathon**

There really isn't a ton to say about this race, to be honest. It was cut from 13.1 miles to 7.1 because of fear of storms, so I ran some of my missing miles before the race, just enjoyed the actual race itself and stopped at a lot of the character photo stops, and just somewhat took my time. I had a couple miles still to make up for it, so I ran those after the race and then headed back to my resort to get ready for another day at the parks.

**Day 4, 01/07/2024, Disney Marathon**

I had fully intended to go into the Marathon and just run it. Not try to get a PR or anything, just enjoy myself and stop for character photos and have a good time. Turns out, my body had different ideas.

I did manage to stop for two character photos (and one bathroom break), but my body was just feeling good this morning. I was running at a quicker pace than my November marathon, my heartrate was lower, and I was just grooving. Unfortunately, I only had 2 gels left for the marathon, but between those and a pocket full of salt chews, I felt alright. I ran for awhile with a guy I met at about mile 5, and I think being able to have a conversation while I was running really helped to take my mind off of what I was doing. 

Then it started raining, and at some point I lost my new found companion and was on my own. But man, I was still feeling good. In November I bonked HARD at mile 19, but I went past that. Then mile 20, then 21. I didn't bonk until mile 24. By this time, my left nipple was bleeding and I had a long streak of blood running down my shirt. My legs hurt, and that's what got me. I had to walk a bit, until the 3:45 run/walk/run pace group caught up with me, and I decided to latch onto them and managed to finish the race with an official time of 3:44:35, putting me in 436th place overall.

\### Training

Starting running during Covid 2020 and always wanted to knock off a marathon.  It took until this year to really start enjoying running. I used Runna’s Marathon Plan and really liked it, peaked at 45 miles. My main goals were to finish the marathon without any injuries and enjoy the process (but a sub 5hr first marathon wouldn’t be bad either). 

I hit my weekly mileage about 85% of the time, either from sickness or bad weather. I tried to at least fit in 4 runs a week, but most weeks I did five: Easy Run, Tempo, Easy Run, Speed workout, Long run. I also did strength training for 45min once a week and otherwise stayed active by walking to work everyday. 
I live in the Midwest now, so most of my training was in the fall and winter (and quite cold!). This definitely affected me on race day.

\### Pre-race

Breakfast was the usual: waffle + PB + banana. I’m not normally a morning runner (hello post-work gang!) so  tried to make an effort during my training block to do some of my runs in the morning. Regardless, I got up around 4:30AM to have my coffee and food. 
I got to the race 30min before start. It’s a smaller race with about 1000 full marathon participants so I was able to be dropped off right by the start. It was 38F at the start ( but warmed up to 65F by the end).

\### Race

The course is mostly flat with a few hills around the LSU area. Set up with the 4:40 pace group and told myself to stay with them for as long as possible. I managed to stay with this group until around mile 21 when I started have some GI issues (more on that later). The LA marathon goes through some great neighborhoods and LSU’s campus. The crowds were thin but very energetic. It was nice seeing families having parties on the route and cheering for all of us.

I settled into the faster end of my goal pace of 10:40avg. There were some hills during the first half but the miles flew by. I managed to PR my half marathon time by 2 minutes! 

The latter half of the course is mostly in full sun, which definitely hit me harder than I expected. Once I made it to mile 20, I started having some GI issues and started getting overheated. Never had GI issues in any of my training runs, so not quite sure where these came from. Ended up having to do a run-walk for the last 10K so I didn’t have an “incident”. It was absolute carnage. Ran to the porta potty at the finish..

\### Post-race

This race was a great first marathon. I am walking away excited to run Chicago in the fall and some shorter distances throughout the year. The biggest lesson I learned is to incorporate some “heat training” on the treadmill to prepare for different race conditions than I’m used to training in.",running

### Background and Training
I am a middle-of-the-pack runner (36M) who started running in mid-2020 and have been predominantly fun-running marathons since 2021. For 2024, I set the goal of running 12 marathons. First up: Houston. 

Over the past year, I've been using the multiple marathoning chapter in Pfitzinger's Advanced Marathoning to loosely structure my training. With 6 weeks between CIM and Houston, I spent one week doing nothing but short easy runs, then transitioned to a 4-week training block and ended with a 1-week taper. Over the 6 weeks, I averaged right around 50 mpw, which I realize is on the lower end, but I'm prioritizing being in good enough shape for each marathon.

### Pre-race
I arrived in Houston Friday evening and stayed at a hotel near the expo and start line. On Saturday, I did a short 30-minute shakeout before retrieving my bib and walking around the downtown area. Race morning I had my usual breakfast of sour candy and made my way to the convention center just after 5am. Wholly uneventful, which is how I prefer it to be.

### Race
Aside from some moderate wind, the weather was great. What wasn't great was my watch's  functionality; when I crossed the start line, it apparently decided to sleep in and not register a pace. After futzing around with it for the first two minutes, I eventually just ended the activity and started a new one. Once I got my watch functioning, I was able to focus on enjoying the run, and it was just a ton of fun: great crowd support, well-designed aid stations and a nice, flattish course. 

### Post-race
The finish area was quite congested with a mix of marathoners and half-marathoners, but after about 10 minutes, I made it into the convention center, filled up on plenty of refreshments (chocolate milk and a hearty breakfast) and retrieved the swag (a mug and short-sleeve t-shirt). 

Overall, I had a blast and wouldn't hesitate to run Houston again. But for now, it's time to fly back to California, take a couple of days to recover and get ready to fun run the Surf City marathon in February.

1322,1705258955.0,WDW Dopey Challenge Race Report (first marathon)!,"1/4/2024
Distance 5K – 27:12

I started from the front of “A” Corral with my friend Liz. The plan was to do this as an easy run (8:30-9:00 pace). I truly had no agenda other than to experience running again. Due to filming, sickness, the holidays, and a million other things I hadn’t been getting my miles and I was just eager to move. 

This race went very well. The course just takes you around Epcot and finishes backstage, as always. I didn’t stop for any character photos (there were not a ton on the course anyway). Splits were 9:10, 8:24, and 8:20 (8:38 avg.). Everything felt easy and smooth. After the race the family and I went to the parks.

1/5/2024
Distance 10K – 56:38

Again, I started at the front of the “A” Corral with my friend Liz. She has all the secrets for runDisney and knows the importance of starting at the front. She also had a secret list of the characters that were out on the course. The plan for this one was similar, keep it nice and easy somewhere around 9:00-9:15 pace. 

Similar to the 5K, this race went smoothly. It starts by zipping out onto the highway, then coming back to do roughly a 5K through Epcot. I did do some character stops, 5 I think? Splits were 9:21, 8:56, 9:06, 8:42, 8:57, and 9:03 (9:06 avg. with photo stops). Everything felt fine…I felt like I was getting into my normal running groove. After the race, the fam and I hit the parks again.

1/6/2024
Distance 13.1 miles (shortened to 7.1) – 1:42:23

Note: at approximately 7pm on Friday we learned that the 13.1 miles was being shortened to 7.1 miles due to storms moving through the area Saturday morning. Additionally, the start time was being bumped up by 15 minutes to try and get people through the course before potential lightning. The news was devastating to Josephine as it meant; 1. She wouldn’t get to run through magic kingdom, and 2. She would not be completing the distance that she trained for. The news was also frustrating to me as I was not excited to finish the Dopey Challenge with an “*” next to it. But, our feelings aside, the race director has to do what’s right for the safety of the runners, workers, and volunteers. I don’t envy anyone that has to make that decision. I am also thoroughly impressed that they were able to get it all switched and ready in a matter of hours.

For this race I opted to start in “C” Corral with my wife and daughter (and buddy, Ron). The plan was to run this together as a family, Ron opted out of that plan. Dianne was/is still in recovery from pneumonia that had her wiped out for the entire month of December, so we made a plan to do walk/run intervals. Initially we started with 5 minutes of running and 1 minute of walking, but switched it to accommodate Dianne’s inability to breathe. 

The course was similar to the 10K course, with a little more time on the highway. We stopped for the first character (Baloo from The Jungle Book), but after realizing that we waited in line for 5 minutes, we decided not to stop for others. Our position in the race was VERY crowded. I think a lot of it had to do with the rushed start. Usually they allow a little more time between the waves in the corrals. Regardless, we ran/walked and took plenty of selfies along the way. 

I need to comment on two very specific things that happened during this race. 1. Dianne really struggled to breathe. While she was feeling better, she was not totally healed from pneumonia. Yet she was determined and pushed through like a champ. 2. Josephine, who spent much of Friday night in tears about the shortened race, became Dianne’s biggest cheerleader. She has a total attitude shift and was a positive force throughout the entire run. My pride for both of them was through the roof. 

Our splits for “half of a half” were 17:05, 11:52, 13:03, 13:07, 13:16, 14:49, and 16:19 (14:10 avg. with one official photo stop and a few selfie stops). Due to the impending storm this race was also pretty humid. I did take in hydration at the second hydration stop, and we had gummies every 30 minutes. After the race we made up our missing miles by walking. J walked through the parks, and Dianne and I just got miles at the resort. The weather, by the way, ended up just being some light rain that lasted for about 90 minutes. 

1/7/2024
Distance 26.2 miles – 3:54:25, 62 in my age group, 545 male, 692 overall.

After the weather on Saturday, the forecast for Sunday looked pretty perfect. The temperature was in the 50s with overcast skies. It was perfect, until it wasn’t. More on that later.

I was eager for anything and everything to go my way for my first marathon…so the good weather felt like a good omen to start. I started in the second wave of “A” corral. My plan was to run alone as that’s how I’m used to running. I did contemplate running with one of the pace groups, but ultimately decided against it. Nothing new on race day, right? I drank an entire bottle of hydration while waiting (90 minutes) in the corral. That meant that when it was time to start, I had to use the bathroom. Unfortunately, I couldn’t leave the corral so I just had to wait until I had an opportunity on the course.  

The race started exactly how I wanted with my pace…I was holding between 8:45 and 9:00 with plans to increase the pace to around 8:30 for the second half (or at least the final 10K). By the time I was in mile 5, I noticed a lot of guys had “pulled over” to pee in the woods. I decided that now was my best chance to do the same. After the longest pee of my life, I was back on the course and right next to the 3:45 pace group (the left a few waves after me so they caught up to me). They were doing the Galloway method with 3:00/30…I decided that I would run a little faster with them, and then slow down a little when they walked. We played leap frog for a few miles until we go to The Magic Kingdom (mile 8-9ish). For me, pace was still on point, even a little fast for a few miles, but things were feeling good. Running up Main Street, USA was a blast, so many people out cheering. Meanwhile, running through the castle was somewhat anticlimactic. I’m not sure what I expected, but as soon as you enter, you're basically out. It was fine, I just thought it might feel like a bigger deal. 

I was excited to exit Magic Kingdom because that meant I was about to have the first sighting of my wife, she was waiting outside of The Grand Floridian. It was still dark, but the area with fans was lit well enough. I saw Dianne at approximately mile 10.5. We hugged, kissed, and she gave me a little snack and I continued on my way. Mile 11 was my next pee stop (quicker this time). I should note, I took fluids at EVERY hydration station…approximately every 1.5 miles (and fuel every 30 minutes). I did this out of nerves and an abundance of caution. I didn’t want to bonk because of fuel or hydration. Unfortunately it also meant three bathroom breaks. 

Anyway, things felt great. I was getting texts from my family and friends…I hit halfway and still felt strong. Next stop was Animal Kingdom. I arrived when the park was still closed, so I would not have the opportunity to ride Everest during the race. At roughly mile 15.75-16 it started to sprinkle. I wasn’t too excited about that as it was already a little cool and I really didn’t want soggy shoes. I passed a race photographer and gave a “thumbs sideways” pose because it wasn’t a total bummer with the sprinkle, but it did concern me a little as the forecast was supposed to be overcast but free from rain all day.

By mile 16 it was full on raining, and miles 17-19 were torrential downpours with extreme wind (up to 30 MPH). Dianne sent a screenshot (I didn’t see it until I finished) of the weather app and it read “Heavy Rain for the next 45 minutes,” and that was no joke. It. Was. Miserable. At this point I was on some backstage roads and saw some overhang/garage type structures and had it in my mind that I could “hide” in a structure and wait for the rain to pass. I immediately snapped out of that delusion and realized that if everyone else was running through it, I could do the same. But my pace took a hit. No matter how hard I pushed I could not get back to my 8:40s…the soggy feet and pouring rain were just too much. As a matter of fact, it was so bad that part of the course was flooded and coned off, so we had to leave the road and run in the grass to get around the flood.

I can tell you that I honestly didn’t hit a “wall” that slowed me down, but I did hit weather that took a serious toll on me. Next up was the dreaded “Bizzard Beach Parking Lot” that happens between miles 19 and 20. Basically it’s a loop through the parking lot…and it is definitely not an interesting or fun part of the course. It was roughly ¾ mile of soggy shoes with nothing to look at. I actually heard that some people just skipped it. Not my style, but you do you. By now the rain had stopped, but it became a game of dodging puddles, at least for me. My feet were already wet, but the idea of making a huge splash and getting soggy again seemed like a bad idea. 

After Blizzard Beach I stopped for my final pee stop and tried to get back into my grove, but I just couldn’t do it. I had it in my head that I was going to slip or get blisters or something. To mix it up, I stopped for a few character photos (with no lines) and that actually improved my mood. Finally, I was heading into Hollywood Studios. I was actually hoping that my buddy and his family would see me here, but he was apparently on a bus stuck in traffic and couldn’t make it to the park in time despite having left with seemingly plenty of time. We ran past Tower of Terror (my favorite ride) and I briefly contemplated stopping, but I knew I would miss my 4-hour time if I did. HS was nice because the park was open so there were a lot of people…but I don’t think most of them actually knew what was going on. Regardless, I knew it meant we were near the end so I loved it. 

As I headed toward Epcot I got a few more encouraging texts from friends which was awesome. So I tried to up my game. After too many miles over 9:00, I was able to get zoned back in and start pushing again. Brief note: after the major rainstorm, I started to briskly walk through some of the hydration stations rather than a slow jog. I don’t know what impact that had on my time, but it was out of some weird thought I had of preserving my wet feet? Anyway, as I entered Epcot I knew I had a 5K left and at that point nothing was going to stop me (except for one more character photo with no line).

Anyway, at this point (and unbeknownst to me), my right nipple started bleeding. This was NOT something that ever happened in training, but I also only trained to 3 hours/20 miles…and adding a 10K to that is significant…and also the rain. Anyway, I could feel that my armpits were chafing, but had no idea the front of my shirt was now bloodstained. Anyway, I was pushing again, my pace was finally back and I was feeling good and ready for a strong finish. I did some bad running math in my head at one point and I thought I only had 14 minutes to go…then when 14 minutes hit I realized that my mind was just being stupid. 

So I hit the final turn, and saw the gospel choir. They started singing “Party in the USA” which was fun to run to for that final stretch. As I approached the finish line I tried to scan the crowd to see Dianne. I was in tears with my accomplishment and thinking about her being there for me. I sprinted to the end (even the announcer commented on my final push) and that was it. I did it. Full marathon complete. I was immediately greeted by a medic asking if I wanted help. I looked at her confused and she pointed to my bloodstained shirt. Having seen this for the first time, I assured her I was OK and made my way through the chute to claim my medals and snacks. 

Sadly my wife was stuck on a monorail desperately trying to get to me. Traffic (human and car) was SO bad that morning that she was stuck in lines just waiting. A ride that had taken less than 20 minutes everyday took her over an hour. 

We finally met up while I was getting my photos with Mickey and Minnie back in the staging/reunion area. We both tried to run to each other and it must have been a comedic sight! She was still hurting from Saturday, and I was unable to make my legs work at all! Finally, we were reunited and it was time for a shower, a snack, and a nap. The bus ride back to the hotel (usually 15 minutes) took over an hour and my legs cramped up. But none of that mattered because I did it.

## Goals

|Goal|Description|Completed?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|A|sub51|*No*|
|B|sub53|*Yes*|
|C|PR (53:59)|*Yes*|

## Background

So long story short, 2023 with a shitshow of a year. In January my gf broke up with me and I was left in València with no friends here (I had moved to be closer to her less than 4 months prior and was too busy working, writing my dissertation, spending time with her and training for some mental/physical health), a PhD thesis to defend in three weeks (cannot make this up) and an internship which paid peanuts, renting a room at friend of my ex's. I gave it two months, if nothing got better I'd just quit and go back to my mom's, but I was determined to give this cool place a chance. Training was one of the things that I could hold on to.

I've cried so much during runs, I've felt so lonely, so out of place... but I can't say I regret any run. After last year's 10K I had had no time to actually think about my goals so I was purely running to breathe. I some weight because I couldn't stomach almost any food for a month; the trend then reversed and I gained back that weight and a little bit. During the ""two months single in València"" trial, after successfully becoming a biotech PhD, I got an offer at my then lab to be a proper researcher and earn a decent salary: I had never seen such money together so I accepted. This led to me hiring a guy to write my training plan. Therefore, *for the last months, I have been testing the following hypothesis*:

* ***Can hiring a coach improve my running?***

I'll try and answer that on this report, hopefully without hurting anyone's sensibilities.

## Training

I've been trained online by this guy since April or May, I think. It's (again, for me) quite affordable and I don't think a runner of my non-level needs much else. I wanted the structure, occasional accountability and basically someone telling me to run some speed, instead of my preferred easy runs all the time and getting frustrated when I don't see any improvements. Also 0 people in my life run so it's nice to share it with someone even though I pay him so he's kinda forced to (40€/month if you're curious). I like he doesn't make fun of my paces but, again, the client here is me. He's nice and no-nonsense, I heard of him through a local podcast.

Every week consists of: Mon/Wed strength training routine (each has defined exercises). Tue/Sat easy/easish runs of some 70-85min (some weeks have more spice than others). Thu ""speed"" workout. Sun long eaaaasy run.

So, how is that better than following a book, besides the accountability/human on the other side? If you remember, last year I followed a Faster Road Racing plan. IMHO, and please be understanding, this is what I preferred about ""The Mister"":

1. No grueling workouts. As months went by, I realized he wrote very manageable training sessions. I mean, some were understandably tiring, but I could almost always complete them. No crazy unapproachable workouts, and that gave me confidence that I could do any given week's training with success.
2. No crazy mileage. Started at 40kmw around May, peaked at 70kmw, very progressively. I didn't burn myself out like last year, doing a lot (for me) of kms since very early on, which was fun until it wasn't and was feeling exhausted by November.
3. No burn out whatsoever, except for this week in which many other things in my life (driver's license failed examination, feeling homesick, new postdoc job, my landlord in the process of evicting us, ongoing therapy because as you might have guessed by now I'm a hot mess) came to a head and I had to skip a workout because I was feeling psychologically unwell.

## Pre-race

Had some nightmares about the race and my usual, tried-and-true weekend breakfast. Went by metro.

## Race & Post-race

So I was in wave 10 out of 12 given that I had guessed on my inscription that my finishing time would hover around 50 and 54 min but got sorted into sub50 in fact. Race starts at 9.30 for the elite (women's WR if you didn't hear! amazing, ladies let's keep keeping it up!) and then sub-elite, wave 1, etc. It's actually very cool to be there not because of the elite (which are hidden doing their warmups and elite stuff) but because mostly because of the ""sub elite""/""pro amateurs"". Some very good runners were in the pee line with me, which always leaves me in awe since they're regular people with a mix of blessed genetics and great devotion to running, who put in their hard work. Atmosphere's 10/10.

Jogged some, peed some, went to my corral. Checked some ladies who seemed to be a bit faster than me (this is my go-to pacing strategy but I'm working on improving it) and planned on following them (they would later prove to be too fast for me, but helped my first 2km). I noticed some runners (especially guys, sorry) tend to overestimate their abilities. I passed hundreds of people who honestly weren't on their way to sub50, but not sub54 either. Race organizers don't demand any proof of ability until the sub36 corral, the fourth one, so I could claim I'm going for sub45 and nobody would bat an eye. Please, be cognizant of your abilities. Mine relatively suck but I try at least to not be an obstacle for anyone. Besides that, I very much enjoyed that race. I negatively-splitted my way and although I was feeling tired, not ""I'm dying"" tired but ""controlled"" tired. HR was above 180 for most of the race, which was against coach's desires but sorry, couldn't help it. I held myself back until the last 2km (>190bpm), in which I gasped for air like a fish out of water. It's my third year running this race and have enjoyed it like never before. I'm determined to try sub50 next year! (since my recent 5K PR is 23:31, yes coach says I'm *aerobically underdeveloped*)

So I confronted the race like a question. Would this plan be better than a shelf plan? Short answer for my poorly-anaerobic legs is YES because I enjoyed most of my way to the race, unlike last year Faster Road Racing which was too much, too fast. 

After the race I showered and went to grab coffee with a friend. Yes, I've made new friends here. Switched jobs. Got that raise. Moved out of that apartment. Learnt the local language to the point I sometimes pass as local. Ran a lot of beautiful kms. Went on incredible trips. Got closer to my mom. Still miss my ex a whole lot tho... see you next year.

1327,1705195184.0,Aonijie running belt review with 500m/l soft flask,"Weight of belt (s/m) with included green whistle: 2.3 oz
Weight of bottle (empty) 0.9oz Weight of bottle (filled) 1lb 0.9oz

There are 4 pockets (2 large front and back and 2 small pockets on the sides) Comes with a bib holder and rear loops with some tacky grips to secure folding trekking poles. However I don’t think you can use the trekking poles when there is a water flask is full. 

Material is 92% nylon and 8% spandex.

I'm inbetween sizes for the s/m and the m/l belt with a 30"" waist and ordered the small (S/M). 

I read other people's reviews about saying to size down and am glad that I went with the smaller size. The fit is snug and not constrictive. It feels how a typical belt should feel like.

Comes with a whistle and a 500m/l soft flask. The flask has a slight plasticky taste to it which I hope will fade over time. It's like drinking water from an inflatable innertube.
The belt fits snug but not overly tight. The soft 500ml flask does not bounce but it will only fit in the rear pocket so make sure you don't accidentally sit down and pop the flask by fogetting that it's there.

The front pocket can fit my iPhone se2020 with an otterbox case on it (thicc setup)

Good purchase and definitely fit my needs as a casual runner.

I knew it was a possibility, but I’m only doing 10km at a time, maximum, and didn’t expect to experience anything like this until I did longer distances when training for a half marathon.

In 2013 when I started working on 50 states, I did the tour pass where I got unlimited RnR races for $400 for a year, I ran 10 half marathons in 8 states, and generally enjoyed their expos.  Even doing ten events, I did maybe half of what they organized that year. 

I just exited the RnR Arizona expo, and holy smokes is it a shell of what it used to be. They’re only organizing about 8 races in the US this year, a third of what they did a decade ago.  Their expo was mostly MLMs, hairstylists, and hotels/travel agencies.  

It’s been on a downtrend for years, this is my eleventh consecutive Arizona RnR since I have considered it my “home” race, but damn.   They’ve never been outstanding events, but like they’re not even trying now.  They don’t even have registration for next year, which makes me think that it’s over.

1338,1705021072.0,Disney World Half Marathon Crap Show,"Date - 1/6/24
Location - Disney World, Florida
Distance - 13.1mi (unofficial), 7.1mi (official course due to weather)

Goal - Finish (success)
Bonus goal - overcome adversity (smashed)

I picked this race because my wife was already signed up and I wanted the challenge. I found a charity that made sense - FORCE (Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered) and raised funds to help with fighting genetic cancers. I trained from early October for 13 weeks using a training program that originally was created on ChatGPT using Higdon as a framework, 3 days a week. 

The night before the race, we received an email regarding an alteration to the course. For those familiar, the original course starts in the Epcot parking lot, loops over to World Drive to the Transportation and Ticket Center up to Magic Kingdom, through the castle exiting near the old Splash Mountain ride, back down to Epcot through the front futuristic section and back to the parking lot for 13.1. The new course would start and end in the same spot, but turn around on World Drive and loop in the World Showcase section of Epcot before heading out to the parking lot near the new Guardians coaster. 

We woke up at 2:30am and caught the 3am bus to Epcot. Knowing we didn’t sign up for a 7-miler, we joined the dozens of other runners logging miles in the massive parking lot, finishing an easy three before heading to the corrals. My wife was in A, I was in E.  Once I started, I kept to the right and spent time “off-road” passing runners in the grass. Snagged a gel around the 4 mile mark (really mile 7), and hoofed it back into Epcot to close it out strong. Rain started lightly and steadily (but gradually) picked up steam. Crossed the finish line at 1:31:00 (6 minutes faster than my marathon-running wife who decided to stop for the characters along the way), grabbed my medal, and hopped on the bus en route to Port Orleans to log more mileage. My finish line was remote, unmarked, and drenched. There was no fanfare, no official timer, nothing more than the watch on my wrist reading the total running time of 2:44:02. I started my victory lap around the 12.5mi mark by blissfully running in every puddle I could find, and I was in good company with the dozen or so other dedicated runners I found finishing their own quests. 

I hit the shower, dressed and grabbed food at the resort restaurant before heading back to Epcot only to get soaked again with the back end of the storm. 

I was glad I completed the distance all at once before leaving. Mentally, I didn’t know if I could handle the full distance without having done it before. The finish of my “race” represented my training block perfectly - in solitude, overcoming adversity, learning more about what I’m capable of physically and mentally.",running

### Training
TLDR: About one week worth of actual training, half of it hungover or drunk. Rest of my fitness came from training from my previous (first) marathon, in October, which was affected by COVID, injuries and glandular fever.

The long version is that I started training for the Melbourne Marathon (Oct 2023) in December 2022, after a couple of years of running. I had a number of major roadblocks while training for what would be my first marathon. 

The main one was COVID, which I caught for the first time in April. I lost around 5kg of muscle in just under 2 weeks (7kg in total). Garmin estimated that I had lost around 9% off my net VO2Max, despite the weight loss. It was weeks before I even managed to climb the single flight of stairs to my apartment without being out of breath. I started training again in late June, with my fitness essentially having being reduced to where it was before I had ever started running. My initial goal of sub 3 hours (which I think I had been on track for before catching COVID) was discarded.

I trained hard and managed to bounce back a fair bit to where I got 4th place in my local half marathon in mid August. Unfortunately, I then suffered an injury when a dickhead of a taxi driver decided to screw with me using his spottos (4X4 LED driving lights) during an evening run, causing me to fall down a shallow ditch while I was blinded by his lights. Bloody wanker turned them on then off and waited for me to put my hand down then immediately flicked them back on, blinding me again. I took a tumble.

After recovering from that by taking a few weeks off, I started training again but was struck by glandular fever just 2 weeks out from the Melbourne Marathon, which I had spent thousands on plane tickets and accommodation to fly to from across the country. I caught it when it went through my office. I was lucky in that my more severe symptoms abated a few days out. Was still bloody knackered by the time race day came around but decided to go for it anyway. Took 3 days before I could walk properly again but finished in 3:33. Decided immediately afterwards that I wanted to do another marathon and signed up for the Hobart Cadbury Marathon, as I had already planned a trip there to meet up with a friend.

Came back up to the Northern Territory where I live straight into what was to be the second hottest Build-Up since records began. The Build-Up is what we have before the Wet Season - no rain, high humidity, high heat, minimal cloud cover, low winds. Heat indexes in the late afternoon were as high as 60 degrees (Celsius) and I don't run in the dark/early morning due to risk of attack from wildlife. I failed every single long run I had scheduled (heart rate at 1 minute slower than race pace got as high as 187 bpm one day, making me quit at 11km into a 25k run) and barely managed 30km a week usually. I realised my chances of doing well were going down the shitter. I got essentially no proper training done in the 2.5 month lead-up. Lots of overtime at work due to short staffing and stress from an engineering degree on top of that meant I was in pretty poor form by New Years. Figured it would be best to enjoy however much of the experience I could.

When I got to Hobart, I finally managed a single long run, on the Friday before the race, just two days out. 25km of running about 30 laps around a public park. This proved to be the only long, slow run I finished since my previous marathon. Aside from that, I did a hungover trail run on New Years day after drinking until the sun came up and a couple more like it in the coming days after some post-dinner drinks.

### Pre-race
After I did my long run on Friday afternoon, I had a sudden feeling of wanting to do as well as possible and genuinely give it my all. I immediately asked my mate to take me to the Taste of Summer festival on the Hobart waterfront and got piss drunk until I was free of that compulsion.

The next day, we drove to Strathgordon and did some hiking on the way over. After about 9 hours of driving, hiking and sightseeing, I got back to his house and had an early night.

Woke up at about 4:30AM and started regretting my life choices. Not about the marathon, just in general. I had two slightly stale bread rolls I'd brought at the start of the week and forgotten about until the night before. Had a banana while my mate drove me to the Cadbury Factory where the start line was. Didn't stretch because it was 10 degrees and I felt too damn cold (great logic, I know).

### Race
Knowing I hadn't properly trained and wasn't prepped in terms of fueling, I lined up with the 4:30 pacer with the aim of finishing.

The race started a couple minutes later than scheduled, but otherwise was uneventful. I suddenly wished I had actually paid some attention to the course map, when I found myself confused as to why we ran 2 1km loops of nearby streets before heading away to do our first loop (the Cadbury Marathon is two out-and-backs). After a few km, I felt really good and started to increase my pace. At about 8km, I realised I was doing well and should probably take this seriously.

I applied a lot of the lessons I learnt from my first marathon and managed a negative split, with most km splits consistently being between 5:00 and 5:10. I felt that I timed my chews and gels quite well. It was mostly uneventful and had a pretty good view. Chaffing started at 10km in the groin but died down at around 20km.

Only bit of drama was towards the end. Once again, my lack of prep showed. I had forgotten that the last kilometres were undulating. Thinking I was done with the last hill, I gave it my all at (I think) 37km, expecting that I could cruise the rest of the way but then saw the upcoming hills and ridges. I paid for it with an agonising final 3km before getting over the finish line with my calves, right forearm, left shoulder and right hamstring cramping at the same time, although I (mostly) managed to hold the pace. Couldn't manage a sprint finish though.

No PB, but close - 3 minutes off.

### Post-race
A few other runners came up to me and said my running form was great.

Had an excellent banh mi, got my free chocolate and fruit, then took an Uber back to my mates house and ordered Nando's. I was met with one of mate's relatives who tried to convert me to Catholicism while I awkwardly attempted to fend her off (lol). 

In total, I ran 96km that week, the most I've ever done in one week by about 20km. 

I was bloody pleased with coming just 3 minutes short of my previous result.

Felt good and was fine the next morning, ready to go up the East Coast of Tasmania. Bit of pain in the kneecaps but was unfazed by stairs. Unfortunately, my photos looked as awful as always.

It seems like every training plan these days claims to be ""adaptive"". They let you pick your training days and what you consider an easy pace, but is that really all there is to being adaptive?

* Ever felt like your ""adaptive"" plan was just a wild guess at your pace, totally ignoring real stuff like soreness or how you're feeling day-to-day?
* Has anyone found a plan that truly adapts to the ups and downs of running – changing needs, injuries, soreness... not just your preferred training days?

I'm really curious because the idea sounds great: training plans that adapt to our individual needs. But it seems like no app yet matches the personal touch a real coach offers. What's your take?",running

1352,1704831017.0,"Avoiding the ""Running Tax"" on Products to Save Money","What are some ""just as good"" products you use in your running life that are cheaper, possibly because they don't include ""running"" in the description—aka: the ""running tax""?

I'll go first: 

1. Instead of BodyGlide for $7.33 per ounce, I use Gold Bond Friction Defense Stick for $2.51 per ounce. To me, it does the exact same job just as a well, cheaper, and with less plastic waste (they put more of the Gold Bond product in a stick than BodyGlide does). 
2. No ""running"" clothes. I find that I can usually find less expensive apparel for running if I simply look for athletic gear—usually because most athletics include running. Jackets, tops, shorts, pants, leggings, socks, hats, etc. *Shoes and hydration gear would be the likely exceptions.*
3. Nipple guards. I just use 3M surgical dressing tape. It's super cheap, stays put on runs, and comes off with soap and water in the shower.

1360,1704731503.0,"The ""Who Even Needs Testosterone Challenge"" -- Natasha -- Month 1 (December)","***Tdlr***;  I am planning to document the effects of HRT-E therapy on my running.   HRT-E involves reducing the levels of Testosterone in my body and increasing that of Estrogen such that both will fall into the range of a  cis (""Natal"") female.

**Overview**

Six months ago, when I first started thinking seriously about transitioning, I came across this set of posts -[https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/a7rfiq/the\_who\_even\_needs\_testosterone\_challenge\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/a7rfiq/the_who_even_needs_testosterone_challenge_an/) \- written over the span of a year,  by a runner named Jocelyn.   In the series,  she documents her experience with Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) and its impact on her running.

For a few days, nearly all of my time was consumed reading the posts along with each and every comment.   At the time I knew next to nothing about HRT and certainly nothing about effects on strength in general.

I've since read way more than I ever thought possible about HRT but in all that time I still have not come across anything as detailed and intimate when it comes to its (perceived) impact on running.

Flash forward 6 months and on 12/1/2023 I made the decision to transition and start HRT.   In her post, Jocelyn points out the lack of studies and her desire to, if nothing else, at least add to the data pool -- in full recognition that her experience was not to be taken with any \_scientific\_ weight.   As an avid, albeit recent, runner, I thought it would be good to do the same -- especially since I bring (I think) some unique perspectives.

With apologies to Jocelyn, I am titling these with the same prefix she used in the hopes that:

    1) It will make it easier for those interested to find both sets
    
    2) Others will add their own data points

**My Story**

There a few things, I think, that make it unique:

1)   I am coming at this with extreme skepticism.   While I believe Testosterone probably has \_some\_ impact, I also believe its effects are overblown.   The issue here is that there are very few good studies that point one way or the other as well as an overwhelming ""belief"" that it does.   To me, that makes anecdotal accounts ripe for bias --whether conscious or not.    ""Everyone says I will lose strength therefore that's why my legs feel this way today"".

Now a couple caveats here:

a)  I have done a bunch of internet searching/talking with others but I have not tried to read the primary research -- so my perception of ""lack of good studies"" is based on second hand knowledge 

and

  b)  obviously even if I come at it skeptically that doesn't make me immune to unconscious bias and, whatever the outcome, this is still nothing more than another piece of evidence without any scientific weight.

Still, I don't think there have been many accounts where the participant is trying to prove the contrary -- so at minimum -- it makes it different/interesting.

2)   I am very in tune with my body making it less likely that I will attribute causations to things that are ""just"" correlations.     This is due to what I, at least, consider a pretty extensive training background.   I have been training in a structured fashion from middle school through high school and then again from age 27 to now.   During most of that time I maintained careful logs not just of distances but of mood, illness and perceived effort.   So when I say I am in tune with my body don’t take it as something mystical or magical -- it is simple a function of the amount of time I've spent introspectively training.

3)   I am old.   Jocelyn sounded like she was college aged and I'm, well, a few years out from that.    Let's just put me down at mid-fifties and leave it at that.    My age gives a few interesting variables I think.    Is there a difference in how HRT affects my body with respect to performance then someone without the many years I have as a cis male?   How much of any degradation in my times will be attributable to age \_rather than\_ HRT?   

4)   I am (relatively) new to running.  Started 4 years ago on zero mileage going back to high school - when I was in Cross Country.    Like my age, this adds a few more confounding variables.   How much of any meeting of expectations simply the effect of greater running experience (think raw miles in legs) canceling out the loss of T?

**My Training**

I work on a yearly cycle wherein the results of the previous year feed into the structure and goals of the next.    The concept is taken from standard practices but especially informed by Friel and his ""Cyclist Training Bible"".    A year cycle starts from the end of the racing ""season"" -- typically Nov -- and runs through the conclusion of the next years racing season.   Within a yearly cycle I break it into 4 phases:   Base, Build, Race, Recovery and then further assign a number of weeks per phase.    Each four week block is a mini cycle of its own consisting of three weeks ""on"" and one week ""off"".   With this in mind I usually end up with something like:

Nov-Apr:  Base

May-Aug: Build

Sep-Aug: Race

Nov: Recovery (a week or so)

I am outlining this to make it clear that the metrics Jocelyn used -- rigid tests every month -- would neither work nor be relevant in my case.    As a concrete example, during the base months I am intentionally not doing \_any\_ hard efforts as that would be counter-productive to the goal.   Running a 5K at full speed would prove nothing and likely only serve to cause injury.

**Proposed Metric**

While I will go month by month to give a sense of perceived effort variations, the actual metric will be how close I come to my 5K goals in Sept/Oct.   Under this model, by June I'll should start getting good indications as I start to ramp up effort and do the random ""C"" races here and there.

**2024 Goals**

I am aiming for a 5K time of low 18's -- anywhere from 18:10 to 18:20 seems reasonable.   In addition I will be targeting an average mileage of 50 with a good few weeks at the end of base of 55.

Last year my PR was 18:40 on roughly 35 mph with a 3 week peak at 50 mph.   Given the increased mileage this year plus the fact that I am only on year 5 of running, I think my goal is neither too conservative or too optimistic.   The wildcard is age and whether that offsets the gains I get from miles in the legs.  In fact, if I was 10 years younger I would target sub-18.   At my age that seems a stretch.   Age calculators put sub-18 within the top 1%, which tells me the closer I get the more I will be fighting over each and every second.

Historical

In 2019 my PR was 22:32 off of 7 mile per week average (362 total)

In 2020 my PR was 22:22 on a practice 5K (covid).  11 mile per week average (595 total)

In 2021 my PR was 20:58 off of 12 miles per week average (652 total)

In 2022 my PR was 19:00 off of 22 miles per week average (1187 total)

In 2023 my PR was 18:40 off of 34 miles per week average (1790 total)

From the numbers you can see my big drop in time corresponded nicely with the increased miles in the legs.

**The ""E"" & ""T"" factor**

I began HRT therapy, conveniently enough for a monthly retrospective, on 12/1.   I am taking 4mg sublingually along with 100mg of Spironolactone.   Those who read Jocelyn's post will recall she began with Spiro for one month before moving to the combo of Spiro and Estrogen.    Why the difference?   Apparently the advice given to Jocelyn was based on a misunderstanding of how estrogen and spiro interact and my regime in now the standard practive.

Another difference is she took hers orally.  Orally is usually prescribed only to the under 35 cohort due to the increased stress that method has on the kidneys.    Taking sublingually, on the other hand, bypasses the kidneys and effectively goes directly into the bloodstream -- making it (theoretically) safer.

And the final difference --    levels of E spike for me and then quickly taper over a few hours while Jocelyns levels would have been more steady state.   I have no idea whether this makes a difference -- and neither does anyone else based on the meta studies I have seen.

**What the current ""science"" says will happen**

The current consensus is that my times will increase until they are within the \_same\_ range as for a cis female.   This means if my current age based time places me in the top 40% of cis males, my performance will shift to be in the top 40% of cis females.    The thought is it takes a full year for this to occur -- which is why many sports organizations ban transgender participation until this year is completed.

A newer study came out recently that found that after a year, a person on HRT still can retain an edge over a cis female.   My understanding is this is for a certain percentage (not all) and that the edge is gone by year two.

None of these studies are definitive, however, and there is much work to be done in this space yet.

**The December (one month) report**

*Goal*

For December (base) my goal was to keep a 40mph average running at an easy pace.   To get my pace range I use Daniels vdot method which, based on my PR, gives me a vdot of 54.   I then arbitrarily step it back 2 because I figure I am no longer at that level after my recovery cycle.  So that gives me an easy range of 7:41-8:41.   In addition, I intended to ramp up the weights to 2 sets of 12 to exhaustion.   This is occurring a bit later this year -- most years I would have started the ramp up in Nov -- which I will need to take into account when analyzing December perceived effort.

*Actual*

Right from the get go I had a hard time with the mileage because I have to do it all on the treadmill (I can't run in the sun due to laser treatment on my face).    In addition I got Covid near the end of the month which a) knocked me off schedule for 4 days and b) forced me to take it easy the first few runs afterwards.   All of this gave me a weekly mileage of:

Week 1:  39

Week 2:  35

Week 3:  29 (covid)

Week 4:  13

All runs were done in a range of 8:34-8:08 mph

Physically, after coming back from Covid I was/am feeling a good deal of joint pain -- as though I had bad arthritis in my knees.   I haven't experienced this since my first 2 years running when my joints were getting used to the stress.  While it's \_possible\_ it is the HRT I think it is more likely to be Covid - especially given it is listed as a common Covid symptom.   This is something I will be monitoring carefully however.

I see no difference in my weight training from previous years -- I am on track for my normal trajectory towards max weights (I typically switch to maintenance by March-April so I don't have a big window)

*The ""E"" & ""T"" effects*

After 1 month of HRT I feel….  Absolutely nothing!   No mental change, no physical change.   Pretty anti-climatic that…

*The Adjusted Goal for January and beyond*

Out of abundance of caution from Covid, I plan on dropping the mileage to 35 and keeping it right at 8:34 mph.   Hopefully that will give my joints some breathing room to heal up.   In Feb, then, I will start the ramp up to 45 with the goal of 50 by March.

I guess it varies a lot based on climate and preferences but I'm just excited to know what kind of runners are out there. 

A few years ago I had no problem running on a treadmill but nowadays I prefer almost any weather to a run indoors. The fresh air, the scenery (even if it's  just the boring neighbourhood block), .... There are a few occasions when I do turn to a treadmill though.

- When our streets turn into literal ice fields with snow melting and freezing again
- Weather colder than -10 C / 15 F, but only because I've heard it's bad for the joints to run in too cold weather?

However, my question is regarding bike lanes. We have a bike route that goes along the Mississippi levee that I often see people run on. I tried running it the other day and didn’t really know what to do. I didn’t realize it was just a bike lane (surprisingly nice for our area btw) I thought it was a larger walkway for bikes and pedestrians. I didn’t know if I should’ve been in the right lane or left lane or fully off the pavement when a bike came by. I just ran in the left lane and when I saw a bike coming, I moved to the opposite lane and gave them a head nod to make sure they knew what I was doing. I kinda felt like that was putting me in the way more, so then I just started running next to the bike lane when people were coming, but there were parts where that wasn’t possible. Are the rules the same for the road? Am I not meant to run there at all? I don’t want to be an ass. Thanks!",running

1372,1704568263.0,Nauseated after every long run,"I’m training for a marathon and have found that after every long run I feel nauseated and have trouble eating. I try to force food down but it is generally unpleasant and very difficult, especially given that I am terrified of throwing up. My tummy is fine during the run (sometimes the second gel gets it a little on edge), it’s after where it gets unhappy. Sometimes I have some loose stool along with the post-run discomfort , but not always. The discomfort and nausea lasts for the rest of the day (I run in the morning). 

I’ve been feeling lightheaded the day after a long run and I suspect it is because I’m not eating enough immediately after the run, but I feel like I can’t possibly eat more or I would vomit. I usually eat like I would on any other day (sometimes unable to finish my plate) + a protein shake. 

Is this normal? What can I do to not feel this way? I’m starting to feel like I can’t keep up the training if I’m going to feel horrible afterwards. 

1 hour pre-run I have an RX or Perfect bar. I run with one bottle nuun electrolytes and one bottle plain water (10oz bottles). I have two GU gels, every 5/6 miles or so (with water). I run at a very relaxing pace, not worried about time, just finishing. The runs themselves generally feel great.

1379,1704488033.0,Running with a light source - how to choose wisely,"It's winter in the Northern hemisphere and many runners around the world (either by necessity or by choice) will have to lace up and head for a run when it's dark outside. While we live in the ""golden age"" of running accessories and choices regarding headlamps are abundant nowadays I decided to post my experience to help newer runners avoid some common pitfalls -both literally and figuratively- when choosing a light source to help them run in the dark more easily...

&#x200B;

**when do you run?** all darkness is not created equal. Generally speaking heading out for a hour after dusk or before dawn will be far less challenging for our light source than running in the dead of night. Weather conditions also can turn an expensive headlamp loaded with all the bells&whistles into an annoying item protruding from our forehead.

**where do you run?**  complex, unfamiliar and uneven running terrain will easily expose any shortcomings of our lighting running equipment.

**how do you run?** running speed (and running dynamics-like vertical oscillation) turns one man's running treasure into another man's trash.

Most potential buyers when searching for a running light will focus on three key areas: lumens, burn time and weight stated. But, as always, the devil is in the details: beam pattern, color temperature, placement options, weatherproofing, type of battery used are equally important (if not more) for those runners frequently engaged in nighttime activities.

&#x200B;

**Putting it all together.**

*Lumens:* the darker/remote/more challenging the environment the more lumens we'll need. Running before dawn in the city with full moon on smooth roads? 100 lumens will be enough (and much more than that may potentially blind passing drivers, exposing us to risk). Mountain running alone under new moon? 400 lumens is the bare minimum (and 600+ is preferable). Keep in mind more lumens=more heat generated (which can become a problem during warm summer nights with a powerful light source on your forehead for extended time).

*Burn time:* more is better-but much more just adds bulk. Aim for a burn time that is 2-3x of our usual time spent running in the dark (both for having headroom for safety and so they we don't have to recharge daily thus degrading the battery quickly). NB-check if the running light meets the Plato FL1 Standard for Run Time as advertised burn times are often misleading.

*Weight:* when all other characteristics are equal, choose the lightest option available. A lightweight running light is more comfortable, more stable and bounces far less than a heavier counterpart (very important when doing faster road intervals or going downhill on trails). For headlamps proper weight distribution becomes a factor after the 100 gram mark and critical for models heavier than 160-180grams.

*Beam pattern:* spotlight lights further down our path but is a narrow beam and messes with our perception (tunnel vision also causes eye fatigue and is more claustrophobic, especially on very dark trails). Floodlight lights way more evenly but not as far. If possible choose a light source that offers both beam patterns, ideally working in combination.

*Color temperature:*  warmer color temperature (2000-3500K) is less harsh and penetrates better through fog and rain. Colder white light (4000-6500K) gives better definition/contrast but becomes next to unusable in dense fog due to glare and causes more eye strain if used for many hours. If you only run in good weather conditions cold white is excellent. If planning to run in bad weather in the night choose something that has both, it'll be worth it.

*Placement:* for most a running light is synonym to a running headlamp. However there a many advantages for using a waist/chest mounted light-way better depth perception (very important when tackling technical uneven terrain), better visibility in heavy rain/fog/vapor from your own cold breath, nothing to squeeze your skull, less bounce. The downside is that the light doesn't track your head movements (and far less offerings available to choose from).

*Weatherproofing:* water resistance is nice to have but adds bulk/weight. Don't get too carried away spending more for a headlamp that is rated for 2m submersion when in reality you never go out running in the rain even at day. 

*Battery type:* having the ability to recharge/swap batteries on the go is a nice-to-have thing for someone who runs for 45 minutes around the city and a crucial feature for an ultra trail runner spending a whole night (or more) running in the wilderness. Be honest. You know who you are. A headlamp that uses standard, non-proprietary rechargeable batteries (like 18650) is preferable. It'll be cheaper in the long end (as long as you're using your running light somewhat regularly).

*""Cool"" features:* automatic beam adjustment and iPhone apps to remotely control your headlamp are useful in some cases but certainly not deciding factors when buying a running light. ""Reactive lighting"" becomes a liability when running in fog/heavy rain (the algorithm gets tricked due to light being reflected back) - and good luck trying to control your headlamp's beam from your phone's touchscreen in driving rain...Well placed buttons with good tactility (to allow use with gloves) is all you need.

&#x200B;

**Conclusions/recommendations.**

&#x200B;

Most runners when choosing a running light tend to go out and buy a super powerful headlamp designed for the most adverse conditions and the harshest of weather ""just because"". The ""buy once-buy right"" mentality many times gets you with a heavy, expensive, uncomfortable, hot and bouncy headlamp that you rarely use. The truth is most recreational runners would be far better served from a cheap 2-pack 200 lumens led clip from Amazon. And most ""creatures of the night"" have more than two top-of-the-line headlamps in their arsenal. Maybe because the ""buy once"" logic does not apply when shopping for a running light...",running

1381,1704461591.0,Oura ring versus smart watch for runner?,"Hi all,

Just realized my FSA covers the Oura ring. Which I also just learned about. 

I currently have a fitbit smartwatch and primarily use it for step count and calories estimation along with checking my sleep score and tracking period. When I had the free subscription I used the health metrics more. But I'm starting get obsessive (ok I AM obsessive) about stupid step count and the bulky design is driving my crazy lately. Aldo the GPS never works and I don't use that feature at all.

So, how is everyone liking the Oura ring for general activity tracking? One thing I hate about fitbit is it counts steps for activities that aren't walking or running (horseback riding). So I take it off and then have to add in the exercise. 

Also, has it helped with sleep like it says it will? I want to be more in tune with my sleep patterns and try to get better nights rest so I feel like the information provided could be useful.

1393,1704239676.0,Best place to travel for preparation to run UTMB,"Hi all,

I am not new to running and this year decided to try my best in x-traversée verbier (one of stages in UTMB world series 76km length run with 5300m ascending).

So I would really appriciate if you can recommend city/village/place, which is affordable, high in elevation, inside EU and good for training to do ultra trail, since I am only allowed to work from EU.

I really need some help finding a running jacket for the colder months.
I went down to the shops today to purchase one and thought it would be an easy task but none of the fit me liked I wanted it to.
I want a loose fitting jacket so there is room for layers underneath as well as still being somewhat loose. The main issue is that they ALL fit tight around my hips/butt. And I don’t like that at all. Makes me feel better when running when the jacket is not snug around anything.

1409,1704139595.0,The tipping point when running becomes a habit,"For 2 years I’ve been regularly running 4-5 times a week.
Before that I had been running on and off for 10 years: anywhere from twice a week to once a month.

What was the tipping point?
I clearly remember how a few specific changes got me into a stable routine, building on top of each other like a flywheel.

1. The first change was getting a fitness watch with daily running recommendations (Garmin). The nudging got me off the couch good 3-4 times a week. Best purchase of that year.
2. Signing up for Strava afterward acted as reinforcement and a commitment driver in front of my sporty friends living elsewhere. Maybe a no-brainer for some, but I’m quite privacy concerned and think twice before using yet another social network.
3. A few months later I got referred to an affordable online coach. Since then I’ve been running 5 times a week. It’s a great commitment device. And seeing my stats improve over time also is a great reinforcement. One of the best decisions of that year.

I tried many other things before - committing to runs with buddies, and going to a gym with colleagues, but nothing seemed to have stuck.

1411,1704128554.0,My fix for shin splints: all input welcomed,"Hi all,

For years I have been suffering from medial tibial stress syndrome, also known as shin splints.

In the last few months I have found a solution to my problem and I would like to share it with you. Mind you, most of you probably have already heard from this solution but my searches (also on reddit) have found mostly some negative conotations but not much hand-on experiences. I would also like to add some background information.

*Mind you, this approach is for chronic (often years) of shin splints in otherwise healthy adults, appearing after only mild build up of exercise. For acute pain in the shints after strenous build-up of activities offcourse a stress fracture needs to be ruled out.*

**The theory**

There are multiple theories about shin splints, including suspected tears/micro stress fractures in the shin bone. It is possible that there are multiple etiologies ultimately ending in the same symptoms. For me personally, the bone-theory was always a bit far-fetched. I would still have shin problems after building up (almost comically) slowely.

I'm a medical doctor myself and have done A LOT of research into shin splints and talked with multiple physiotherapist and sports physiology doctors (for what its worth, i'm from the Netherlands, it might differ a bit between countries). The wide consensus was that most of the complaints that arise from shin splints can be explained by adhesions or growths of scar tissue in the fascia surrounding the tibialis and calf muscles. The fascia contains a rich innervation of pain sensors, and chronic pain, like chronic pain anywhere else in the body, can reinforce itself and amplify any (harmless) signals arising from the nerve endings in the fascia. Thus the chronic and often recurring nature of shinsplints. Moreover, the shin bone is often NOT visibly damaged during imaging studies such as CT or MRI (even when the shin complaints are at their worst), which strengthens the argument for shin splints as a possible fasciopathy.

Maybe you recognize this, maybe not, but after sitting for a long time I can actually feel my shins tighten and even have a 'tear like' feeling when standing up. For myself I am quite certain the fascial adhesions are the main culprit.

**The solution**

Now for the solution; I have found that Manual Adhaesion Release works wonders. This can be done with a physiotherapist, but can also very easily be done by yourself. Which I wil describe below.  


1. Massage the calves (I use a Neckteck neck massager, but can also something like a foam roller).
2. Put NSAID gel (ibuprofen gel or diclofenac gel) [just off the edge of the medial edge of the shin bone](https://ucarecdn.com/3ab8499b-a506-43ba-9272-8b16ede9708f/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/). The first times it can be helpfull to mark this location with a marker. Be sure to NOT put it ON the bone, it has to be on the soft tissue just beside the edge of the shin.
3. Afterwards, use a firm and rounded-pointy tool (I use a gua sha tool with a handle) and gradually and progressively deeply scrape the tissue. Personally I feel and hear the scar tissue break down under the tool (hear crackles, feel bumps where you have to go through after they will soften). You have to apply the tool with quite some force. Yes, this is offcourse painful. The NSAID gel helps a bit, while also lubricating the skin so you will not damage the skin but only work the tissue under it. A lot of videos on the web about massage/skin scraping etc. are working way to superficial. You really have to go DEEP. Think about this: throwing a very small stone 10 times slowly at a window will not break the window. 100 times or 1000 times will also not break the window. But one big stone with force will brake the window in one time. I think a lot of misconception about this fascia release is because people are not putting in enough force. I have talked with physiotherapist applying the technique with a lot of succes, and just to give an indication of the force sometimes needed: it is not uncommon for patiënts to have multiple bruises on the area that has been worked on.
4. After doing the tissue release put on compression socks and immediatly go running. Helped with the NSAID gel and the now (temporary) supple tissue you can build back the confidence of pain-free running. Knowing how chronic pain works, I think this is THE crucial step in the recovery. Do build up very slowly.

The adhesions will gradually come back, especially after days with lots of sitting, or no other mobility/strenght training. But each session you will experience that less effort is needed to release the adhesions.

I am very curious on your experiences.

**TLDR:**   
Personal experiences and research makes me believe that adhesions in the fascia medial of the shin bone combined with hypersensitive nerve fibers located there are one of the main cause of the pain associated with shin splints. Deeply remove said adhesions with the aid of NSAID gel (important!) using a gua sha tool, build up your running immediatly after and 'retrain' the pain system. For me this has been the most promising permanent relieve of my shin splints after a decade of pain during my running.

EDIT: to avoid making this post too long I have not discussed al other factors and therapy options for shin splints. Of course combine deep tissue massage with strength work, calf stretches, increasing cadence etc. But most people who have years of occurring shin splints will know this all already. ",running

1423,1703882225.0,Any 400m recruits here?,"I think that it would be interesting to have a group of runners from r/running challenge the assumptions on r/sprinting by seeing what they can do over 400m coming from a higher mileage than would ever be suggested there. The goal wouldn't be to run extremely fast, but to put down an honest time trial over 400m and then improve on that as much as possible by the end of the spring track season. Even if it doesn't impress anyone else, the goal is just to improve your own time as much as possible (without injury/loss of endurance) and reap the benefits. 

When I was first reading about running online as an XC/distance team guy in high school, the name Alan Webb was everywhere.

Anyways, looking at the stats I noticed that he actually had quite the 400m to back up his mile. Nobody ever really mentions this in all the discussion about him, but I think that not focusing on the 400m and 800m and moving up the the 10k, while impressive, meant neglecting his strength in terms of his quote ""speed is quite the weapon"". So, basically this is my pitch on why working on the 400m may be worth it to you a 5k/ mile guy, I think that at the competitive level it actually is needed to improve running economy while kicking in a race. 10km pros apparently have tons of fast twitch fibers, though we see it as a distance race at the recreational level.

It would be cool if we could get a group together and work on the 400m time and I would be able to provide updates on my own training (2 reps of sub 60 is my goal right now to see if I can do that without injury). Also, I would be able to provide feedback both in terms of, how to use spikes and blocks to go faster, when and how to work on your 150-200m speed for the 400 m, and when you're getting so fast at the 400m that it's time to move up to focusing 800m (or 500-600m), if your goal is aerobic ability.

1424,1703948608.0,Waterproof over ear headphones for running,"I've had a bit of trouble finding over ear headphones that stay on while running and are waterproof (ish). I run almost daily but here it rains like 30% of the year and now that its winter it snows a lot so I generally can't avoid my headphones getting wet. In the summer it's alright since I can use in ear headphones, but in November- March I need to use a headband or hat to keep warm so I use over ear headphones. Does anyone have any recommendations.

1425,1703900702.0,Aussie Runners - which Gold Coast race weekend for a 5K?,"Hi all,

Currently looking at lining up my races for next year and want to focus on doing 5Ks - mostly seeking races around big weekends with a fun atmosphere and some events or expos on.

I'm trying to decide which of the big Gold Coast race weekends to add to my schedule - whether it's the [5K Fun Run at Gold Coast Marathon](https://goldcoastmarathon.com.au/races/5km/) (July) or the Brooks 5K at [Gold Coast Running Festival](https://www.theeventcrew.com.au/event/gold-coast-running-festival/distances/) (April). 

I know the GC Marathon is considered one of the prestigious marathons in the country, but wanted to check in to see what the 5K experience is like and whether people would suggest one over the other as an overall experience.

1432,1703873238.0,What are the truly important features and metrics that your sports watch offers you?,"I have a mid-range sports watch with all the bells and whistles one could expect from a contemporary product in this category. Just the list of running metrics alone is wild. During/after a run I can see at least

- duration
- Distance
- Current and average pace 
- Route
- Elevation
- Split times
- Heart rate (avg, max, graph)
- Time in HR/speed zones
- Cadence (avg/max)
- Calories burned
- Energy sources used (carbs/fat)
- Running power (avg/max)
- Estimated Vo2Max
- Cardio load

There are also long term metrics related to training, like cumulative cardio load and recovery status.

On sleep the watch tells me the usual timing, duration, sleep stages, HR/HRV and respiration during sleep. It gives me a sleep score and an estimate of my daytime energy levels based on my sleep.

And then there’s of course the activity metrics like active time, steps, inactive time. And 24/7 heart rate.

I’ve realized that from all of these features and metrics, I actually care about distance, pace, duration, and elevation, and weekly/monthly/yearly statistics of the distance and number of workouts. I don’t need sleep tracking. I don’t need to track my steps or daytime HR. Even heart rate during a workout feels unnecessary to me. All these additions feel like laundry list items that have been added because other products have them too, and the consumers expect all these features to be there, no matter if they’re accurate or in any way useful metrics for a hobbyist runner like myself.

I’ve actually started to fantasize about a watch with a great build quality that gave me just the basics as accurately as possible, and this would also be reflected in the price tag. I’ve actually been using my almost-10-year-old Polar M400 again, as it has minimal fluff.

1449,1703725020.0,Treadmill mat advice,"Hey folks,

I'm trying to get back into running and, as hubby recently bought a treadmill, figured I'd jump in and have a crack. I can't even tell you how much noise this thing makes. I gave up when the ghost of Robin Williams jumped out of it, complete with safari hat,  and screamed STAMPEDE! 

It's a Lifespan Apex (hubby is a big dude) with foam mats underneath, on a vinyl floor, in a raised house. No neighbours to worry about by I think they heard me three towns over. I know it's par for the course but even my water bottle in the holder was jumping around, not something that happens at the gym (which is a concrete floor so might not be as worrying as I think?) 

When shopping for the foam mat I went thickness over density. Should I get more of a hard rubber one? Layer them a couple high? I'm worried I'll tip it off balance if I do that, but I really have zero clue what I'm doing here. 

If it matters, I'm 5'2, 70kg, and when I say ""run"" it's more of a frantic shuffling motion, like a donkey trapped in a sandpit (max speed 7.5km/h unless I'm doing 20 sec intervals at 10).

1453,1703661416.0,Men's Compression/shorts/tights/leggings Recommendations (non see-through),"Hi everyone!

As I'm pushing my half marathon distance to start working towards marathon distance, I've been finding that around the 8-10mi mark, that shorts always just start riding up and bunching. I've been trying to find some tights/leggings that will work well for both running as well as general gym training.

One issue I keep running into (which I've known exists for years from always helping my wife determine for hers) is the ""see through test"". Basically every paiir I've tried is practically fully transparent, Nike definitely seems to be the worst. Since my wife uses underarmour and she thoroughly ensures non-see-through, I recently got a pair of underarmour heat gear. Again, transparent. My wife's underarmour gear isn't, so I'm not sure where they fell flat in the transition to men's gear.

Anyway. Have any of you guys that wear them found some decent brands/models that don't run see through?

1460,1703635865.0,Running Gadget Combos,"So I think I’ve found a combination of running gadgets that have made running much more efficient and enjoyable for me personally. These are obviously all unnecessary, and I know many people find gadgets intrusive, but I love the data and run on HR. Anyways, here are the items I use:

1. Garmin Watch (for me, forerunner 965) with navigation capabilities: I get bored of running the same old routes and having the ability to upload routes onto my watch to follow is amazing. It’s really intuitive and works really well when running routes you haven’t done before. Also the watch is amazing on its own. 

2. Polar H10 HR band: most accurate HR monitor. As good as the watches can be, I’ve found that during high intensity intervals or fartleks, it’s not very accurate. Polar is super accurate and reliable if doing HR based runs. 

3. Engo 2 Eyewear: completely unnecessary and expensive but I love it. Both better and worse than I thought it would be. Allows me to see 6 data fields in the top left field of my vision while I run so I don’t have to look down at my watch while running to check HR, pace, cadence, distance, etc. Can be intrusive but I personally like it. Allows me to have the navigation on my watch full screen so I can reference when needed if I’m getting lost. 

4. Strava: not really a gadget but allows me to draw/plan routes and upload onto my Garmin Watch. Really great interface and easy to use. 

5. Stryd Duo: I really enjoy the footpath function and the more accurate distance and pace. I’d like to eventually transition to power based running. The footpath is interesting to see symmetry and has cued me into discrepancies in my running form. After an injury I saw how my left foot path was really asymmetrical and off so I did some PT for my left leg and my form has been much better. 

This is all probably excessive but I’ve enjoyed the complementary function of using these gadgets.

1461,1703619620.0,"Searching for a non-vest, non-handheld Boston Marathon allowable-hydration system that's more than 22oz and less than 1L capacity","(Or at least I'm too inept to find it)  
I've searched what feels like everywhere (REI, Marathon Sports, Fleet Feet, Nathan, Amphipod, Camelbak) and can't seem to find this unicorn of a hydration system: waistpack with no more than a 1L capacity. Most of the 1.5L waist packs are more like the vests with a bladder (vs a water bottle) but I'm hoping somewhere there's one like that with a reservoir that meets the requirements of being 1L.  
Boston doesn't allow hydration backpacks, and I need more than a handheld (also to carry chews/salt/phone) and most waistpacks I'm seeing are no more than 20oz single or double bottles...or 1.5L capacity reservoirs or higher. Surely I'm missing something in the middle, right? Any guidance or other alternatives I haven't thought of are welcome!  
I'm extremely slow and chronically severely dehydrated so yes, I really do need that much water (it's not uncommon during summer marathon long runs to drink more than 3L) and I don't want to count on hydration stations being available because I'm worried that I'm slow enough that some of the stops will be out of stock or closed down by the time I get there, especially the latter half of the race.",running

Moved by all the responses, especially to something that was a little embarrassing to admit. I hope all these tips can help everyone, I'll be using many of them. Wish everyone the best in your own running and life journeys.

&#x200B;

Hi r/running. I've been feeling increasingly stuck with my running and wondering if anyone has every faced and overcome something similar.

Context: 30F, youth athlete who played competitive soccer. Type A try-harder-er. Played in college and transitioned to a mix of soccer, running, lifting etc in 20s. Running began for me as training for soccer. The ""push yourself hard"" mindset was my core, and maybe one I sometimes took to far. Mid-20s I ran short short distances ( 3-6 miles, always hard pace), my body could take it, it felt good.

Now: My relationship with running has become increasingly a struggle last year. Hitting 30 I cant push myself the way I used too. It's led to this trouble with this compulsive speeding. I start slow but by habit cant help but push myself to a hard pace (for me). Recently I can only make it a mile or two at the pace I used to do 5-6 miles. Then my body just wants to stop. If I let myself stop I feel a sense of guilt and frustration. Sometimes I stop, pant for a bit, then start again, and it turns into these semi-sprint repeats when I sent out to do just a medium intensity couple miles. Increasingly I'm anxious about going running and facing this battle with myself. My goal is to be a regular runner who enjoys it, gets good exercise and finds the  balance with the satisfaction of pushing oneself but not too painfully.

\- Anyone face similar compulsive thoughts/actions on speed and how have you dealt with them?

\- How does one rebuild their relationship with running? Is it possible or do you know people who just quit it?

(Note- Yes I realize this may be something to see a therapist about. But posting in case others may have similar experiences and tips on addressing)

(Note- I've run a few times with run groups and it's been amazing. It seems with others to pace me, I don't do the compulsive sprinting thing. But I would like to be able to do that self-regulation and run on my own)",running

1502,1703048558.0,Has Brooks gone down in quality?,"I got a pair of Brooks Adrenaline shoes in January this year. By March, the heels were ripped up. I hadn’t bought Brooks in a while, but I feel like the last pair I had held up for much longer before I started to see wear/tear. Now, the rubber (?) frame is showing through the heels. It looks terrible. 

I’m probably going to buy another pair, since I love how these shoes fit…but has anyone else noticed the quality change? I also saw on their website that a few reviews mentioned the same experience I had. Maybe it’s anecdotal, but I don’t want to spend another $100 on shoes that won’t last more than a few months before the heels start to get worn down.

ETA: Thanks for all the feedback and experience. It seems I either got a dud pair or I underestimated my mileage (kinda doubt it, since I have only gotten back into running more seriously in late fall). I definitely have less than 300 miles on these. But I understand all shoes have a lifespan, so running more often will mean I need to replace my shoes more often! I appreciate the suggestions to contact customer service or try a different model!",running
1503,1703069054.0,Patagonia Houdini,"Just started running regularly every morning about a month ago and I’ve been looking to get a nice jacket as it’s getting colder here now in Toronto. My question is, is Patagonia Houdini the real deal? Or do you guys have other suggestions? Right now it’s $135 and it’s kinda expensive so if you have any recommendation for a cheaper one, I’d appreciate it. I might consider investing in a Houdini if it is really that good. Thanks guys!",running
1504,1703080661.0,Are Pittsburgh Marathon VIP Race Weekend Festivities worth it?,"Hey everyone. I can't be the only one who thinks the race weekend is the BEST part of a marathon, right? This is the first time I've been offered a race weekend VIP package, though. Is it worth it? Here's what they offer:

1518,1702940135.0,anyone notice saucony shoes are getting worse?,"since i started my running journey, i have been wearing saucony shoes.  the first pair i got sort of randomly as they were on sale at a mark's work wearhouse near where i live.  i loved the way they fit and the feel of them when i ran.  i put over 1600km on them before i felt they were too worn to run in any longer. i still have them as knocking around shoes as the upper stayed in really nice shape but the treads were a bit flat.  in the 4 or 5 pairs i have had since then, i have noticed they seem to be getting progressively worse made. the treads wear faster, the soles seem to lose their spring faster and the insoles wear out faster.  i don't buy the most expensive ones, but i don't get the cheapest ones either. i always get the sort of middle-ish ones when they are on a good sale.  

has anyone else noticed their saucony shoes are not as durable as their prior pairs?   and is there another brand people use that are at a similar price point but more durable/better made?

Recently I was on a trip and didn't bring running clothes, but I was wearing my [Kuhl deceptr](https://www.kuhl.com/kuhl/mens/pants/new-deceptr/) pants. They don't look like running pants... at all. But somehow they are fantastic! Great mobility, I can run with my phone in my regular front pocket, they have a tapered leg and an elastic waistband.

I've got like 60 running miles on these pants now and they just work... My biggest complaint is that they are a bit ""swishy"" sounding because of the fabric texture, and the fact that they look almost like work pants, I feel a bit ridiculous.

What pants does everyone else run in? I LOVE being able to just run with my phone in my pocket, but I don't want to look like I'm late to work.

Edit: Thanks for all the great responses. Some great looking options out there in the \~100$ price zone. I think i will keep an eye out for a deal and maybe try some on in a store if i can find them. In the meantime, I think i'm just going to keep cruising in these Kuhl pants. Don't try to fix what ain't broke maybe!

Shouldn't be the same pace or a faster one for the longer distance. It's still the same elevation gain per kilometer.

Also based on some data from ~16000 races and ~2800 runners, it was found that 87m gain equal to 1km flat. I heard about this before with 100m being 1km flat. What's your opinion on this topic?

###Collections
We're trying to take advantage of one of New Reddit's features, collections.  It lets the mods group posts into Collections.  We're giving it a try on posts that get good feedback that would be useful for future users.  We've setup some common topic Collections and will add new posts to these as they arise as well as start new Collections as needed.  Here's the link to the wiki with a list of the current Collections.

https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/collections/

Please note, Collections only works for New Reddit and the Reddit mobile app for iOS.

###**Using r/running**



The mods do their best to actively moderate this community. When posting, we expect users to make an effort to familiarize themselves with our rules and practices before submitting posts or comments. We suggest taking note of **Rule 2** *and* **Rule 7**, *since these are the most commonly broken which will result in a thread being removed.*

The mod team has tried to lay out the rules with some expected guidelines of what is or is not allowed, but there is always some gray area and posts are up to interpretation by the mod team.  We do our best to be consistent, but that isn’t always the case with multiple mods or even the same mod between similar posts.  The mod team wants to make /r/running a resource for new and experienced runners and to build a community between all types of runners.

Regardless of that fact, Moderators have the final say.  We are open to hearing differing opinions, but the mod team will make the final decision.  Visitors and posters in /r/running are expected to understand that the mod team are people too and doing the best they can to manage a very large sub with frequent posts every day.  If you do not agree with how this sub is moderated, we expect you to do so in a civil manner….and also know when it is time to drop it.

We are very upfront in stating that the sub is heavily moderated, but we do recognize that not every user wants that.  The wonderful thing about reddit is that there are plenty of subs to check out and hopefully find one more to your liking.  If you find the  moderation here too strict, some other related subs with less moderation are /r/runninglifestyle/, /r/BeginnersRunning/, /r/runningquestions/, and /r/Runners/.

_____


###**Recurring Threads**

In order to reduce clutter and nudge you lurkers into posting, we have created a number of daily and weekly threads for you to read, make a comment, or ask a question. Unless you truly believe your new thread will make a new and interesting contribution to Runnit, please wait until the related weekly thread rolls around and post in there instead.  A more complete description of the threads can be [found in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_reccuring_threads).

Here are the current recurring threads with links to the most recent (hopefully) weekly thread:  

*Please note that the search links for the daily threads (Q&A and Achievement) will not work on mobile.  If you are using mobile, sort the sub by ""Hot"" and the current Q&A thread will be stickied at the top.  For the Achievement thread, sort by ""New"" and scroll down a bit to find the current Achievement thread.*

* [Daily Achievement Thread (Posted daily)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=%22achievements+for%22+author%3Aautomoderator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all): Any and all accomplishment posts should be posted here. Anything from new PRs, to longest weekly mileage, to running your first ultra – literally any accomplishments you experienced recently!

* [General Q&A Thread (Posted daily)](https://old.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=Official+Q%26A&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all): With such a large sub, there are a lot of running-related questions that come in every day. In an effort to keep the front page of the sub uncluttered and fresh, we ask you post your questions, particularly those one-off questions that are potentially short and don't necessarily provoke significant discussion, in the daily General Q&A thread.

###**Rules**
We have further [explanations of the rules in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_rules), but as noted in the side bar, please take note of Rule 2 and Rule 7 as they are the ones most cited for post removals.

 **(2)** - *Posts need to generate discussion and/or useful information that other searchers can then benefit from. Low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts, posts not directly related to running, and questions that are easily answered by FAQ, searching r/running, or Google are subject to removal at the moderation team's discretion.*  

This sub attracts a lot of beginners as well as “drive-by” posting.  A major goal of the sub is to promote quality discussion and develop a community where information and experiences can be shared.  Many of the common questions have been answered, either in previous threads/FAQ, or could easily be answered in the daily Q&A thread.  Yes, circumstances can vary person to person, but it is expected that posters make an attempt to find these answers for themselves before making a stand-alone post.   Visitors should put forth some effort in finding the answer themselves and not expect the Runnit community to do all the work for them.  If the post/question is very specific to your situation (such that other general user won't get much benefit from the information), then it belongs in the daily Q&A thread.

If you do make a stand-alone post, please include info relevant for the community to help.  It is nearly impossible to offer any advice without sufficient background information.  Items that could be relevant:

* Age

* Sex

* Current MPW + pace

* Previous peak MPW

* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed

* Goals (including specific races)

* Previous PRs

* Other things you think might be helpful to include

Below are some of the reason a post would be considered low-quality, thus being removed and directed to the Daily Q&A thread:

* ""Does anyone else..."" type posts?

* ""Is X a good time for...?"" posts

* If your post is a question in the title (including “See title” or “Title says it all” in the body).

* If your question can be asked in one sentence.

* If your question is very specific to you or your situation.

* If your question can be answered either with a yes/no.

* In general, it is helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  

* Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.

Finally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of r/running, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.

 **(7)** - *Do not solicit medical advice. This includes 'Has anyone else experienced this injury?' type posts.*  

While there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some minor, common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  

There is a big difference between ""Hey, my IT band is tight. Got any good stretches for it?"" and ""My shins hurt every time I run. If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?"" If your question involves sharp pains, unknown/vague pains, or injuries/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.

Also, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.

So I have a one year old and a 4 year old. I’ve gone through a pelvic floor PT. I’ve done the exercises, but I’m hitting my limit here. I just want to get back to something that feels like myself, something I can be proud of. I trained and ran a half in October, but I have no pelvic floor anymore and completely peed through absorbent underwear. It ruined my whole pride in finishing the half, I was embarrassed and just wanted to go home. I want to run a marathon before we think about having a third, but the inability to keep my dang pee in is honestly making me not want to do it.

# Training:

2023 was a big year for me as I (23M) finished university and began teaching science at an international school overseas in July. Despite much warmer temperatures than where I'm from, I managed to keep up with my running. I began training for this race seriously in early October of this year. I had previously run two trail 50k races and two standard marathons so 100k was a big step up for me, but not insane given my experience. I have always been better at short distance (5k PR: 17:43) than long distance (Marathon PR: 3:28), so I wasn't exactly sure how this race was going to go. I'm not able to run as fast in the heat either compared to cooler temps.

I managed to ramp up to 80k weeks by the last four weeks of my training before taper, with the previous 8-ish weeks fluctuating between 50-70 ish. This was big for me, as I hadn't previously been able to get more than 60km/week consistently. In my arsenal, I had 5 ish long runs around 25-30k, one 27k trail race, one 40k run five weeks out (my longest), and one weekend where I did back to back long runs on sat/sun (around 30k each day for a total of 60k over two days). Threw a few speed sessions in for fun and did the rest of my training at slow paces for me, between 5:40 and 5:55 per km most days.

My taper was abrupt, as I had a bad long run into an illness that meant I didn't run any more than 30 kilometers per week in the three weeks leading up to my race. I planned for a three week taper from 80k down to around 30km/week but really just ended up running 20-30k for the last three weeks. I'm pretty sure I was recovered by my race, but not 100 percent sure.

During my training block, I did zero strength training, did not drink alcohol, averaged 8 hours of sleep per night, and smoked weed 1-2x per week. Anecdotally, the weed didn't make me feel any worse during runs, but obvs it's not good for your lungs and I also noticed that it sometimes left me feeling less rested after waking up in the morning. So I assume it had a slight negative effect. Just wanted to add my N=1 opinion on that as this always seems to be a topic that people have mixed feelings on in the athletics world.

# Pre Race

After flying to Vietnam late a day before the race, I spent the following morning and afternoon doing my best to relax for the 6pm start. After an ass clencher of a motorcycle taxi ride through what I can only assume is the completely normal traffic chaos in Ho Chi Minh city, I arrived at the race. Super flat course nestled in a rich suburb in the city. 17x loops of \~5.9k. Each lap had three aid stations with bananas/watermelon, electrolytes, and water. The starting line had the same with even more food options, although I only ate bananas and watermelon for the whole race and drank a mixture of electrolytes and plain water.

# Race

It was completely dark by the 6pm start of the race and after a briefing which I understood none of, we were off. I went out at what I thought was a conservative pace (6:30/km) and quickly bumped into  a local runner who ran a pleasant first loop with me. I quickly realised during loop one that I was having some digestive issues, but not wanting to stop for the bathroom so early, I decided to just ride it out and see if things got better (spoiler alert, they did not). After the first loop, my running partner and I decided to part ways as he wanted to slow down and I wanted to speed up. I spent the second lap with a group of dads, but I ended up running past them too. From then on, not even 12k into the race, I basically ran alone aside from a few short encounters with other runners.

At 15k, my nipples started chafing so I took my shirt off. Not two kilometers later, I got hit on for the first of many times this race. ""Handsome man!"" one of the volunteers called out to me, a remark which hadn't been made in previous loops until I came around shirtless. That is no coincidence. ""Thanks, my nipples were chafing"", I suavely replied, making a gesture at my chest area. She swooned.

My watched proved to be accurate for distance throughout the race, which was good, because I quickly lost track of my laps completed. I ended up conceding to my bowels and used the bathroom around 30k in, which improved things substantially (sidenote: don't worry about sacrificing 3 minutes to use the bathroom during an ultra marathon. I promise you there are far greater time losses ahead that will make this negligible). At this point, I could already tell that this was going to be harder than I thought. My HR was higher than normal at a slower pace than I'd been training and I was feeling tired already. The crowd kept me going for a little bit, especially the announcer, who had taken a fondness to making announcements as I completed laps. ""here comes \[polarchips\]...from \[country\]"" was his signature call. The spectators were fantastic too, always cheering you on. I seemed to be a fan favourite as one of the two non-Vietnamese people there, standing a head taller than the average person at the event.

(warning, some f-words in this next paragraph. I added them because it was honestly how I felt in the moment)

I reached a dark, dark mental place around 48k, where I took a long, long walk. I was very close to quitting right then and there. If I was already walking at this point, was there even a chance of finishing in any reasonable time? And why the FUCK was I already tired? I was going slower than my training place. I was eating constantly. Absolutely mainlining bananas. Maybe I just didn't want it enough. Maybe I just didn't care. Maybe this was all a bit mistake. Who the fuck was I to get into a race like this and WHY was all the training not helping? I flashed back to my final bad long run of my training and wondered if it had messed up something in my body, or perhaps I tapered too much. How was I this bad at long distance when my short distance was so much better? Maybe I'd just finish this lap and call it quits. Embarassing for sure, but a learning experience. Or maybe I could just lay down in the grass right here until someone wonders where I went and comes to find me.

This went on for around three kilometers, during which time I mustered the mental energy to run for maybe half a kilometre. But then there came a point where I decided to try running again, and for a split second, the running didn't feel so hard. And I thought to myself that if it didn't hurt right in the moment, I should just keep running. That flipped the mental switch. All of the sudden, I was back. I was reminded at that moment of an ultra running article I read that morning that reminded its readers that there will inevitably be low points in ultra marathon but they will pass. I had a goal to achieve. The time didn't matter, I just wanted to get 100K done. And I couldn't disappoint my fans by stopping. DNFing wasn't gonna be a good look with the ladies. ""We are DOING this"", I triumphantly told the aid station volunteers the next time I passed, a mantra which I repeated to myself for much of the next half hour. At one point, I got so hyped up that I just screamed it out  as I ran through a quiet section of the course. It felt like a much-needed release.

The next 10 km were smooth. I was feeling kind of ill so I decided to switch up and slightly reduce my food intake, which left me feeling much better. I probably consumed within the realm of 15 to 20 of just bananas during the course of the entire race, but as things went on, I got some watermelon as well. I had electrolyte drinks every couple kilometers. Perhaps I ate too much overall? That seems hard to believe.  Anyways. The race went on. Each lap was another milestone. 60k. 66k. 2/3 of the way there. Legs started to get noticeably more tired around 70k after a relatively stable previous 20K. My pace was way slower than anticipated by this point but I didn't really care. I just wanted to finish. I decided to take up the aid station volunteer on his offer to try out a cooling spray to try and counteract my leg fatigue and it worked like a charm. I basically only walked at aid stations for that lap and ran the rest.

At the start of the next lap, I was informed that the other foreign runner was only a few minutes ahead of me, and armed with my cooling spray covered legs, I subconsciously decided to pick up the pace to try and catch him. Perhaps just a coincidence, but soon after, at 75k, my quads started giving out. They just could not handle the stress of pavement impact anymore and I wasn't able to generate much torque at all for a quality stride. I walked another half lap, which at this point was a struggle, and tried a bunch of different strategies to clear up my pain: Stopping and stretching, sitting down and massaging my legs, even some alternate running techniques, all to limited avail. This was the second time during the race that I considered DNFing. I was more at peace with this, as in my mind, there wasn't a whole lot I could do otherwise. I literally couldn't run more than 50m at 8:00/km pace and I wasn't that keen on walking the last quarter or so of the race. I made a vow to struggle through the rest of the lap walking and see if the massage station workers would be of any help. Long story short, they were. Even though it added a good 10 to 15 minutes to my race time, the massage essentially saved my legs. I ran the next lap without walking. About 17K to go. There was a light at the end of the tunnel, The only issue now was my chafing butt, but this issue was solved by the big brain move of...pulling down my underwear slightly in my shorts. Genius.

4:30 AM, ten and a half hours into the race, I began the third to last lap. It was all heart at this point. 5:00 AM. The sunrise started peeking its head over the horizon, which gave me some hope. I had been reduced to alternating 200m run/100m walk, except when the camera crew came by and I mustered the strength to run for a absolutely collosal three minutes straight as they got some footage of me running that I hope is going to look really good. Two laps to go now. The next lap, I was going to be seeing all the features of the course for the last time. I was particularly happy to never see the long, depressing straightaway that comprised the last 2 km of every lap ever again. Not many runners were left at this point, quite a few had finished (there were some professionals) and I think many had also DNFed, which left me in a relatively lonely position of being one of the slower runners on pace to finish before the 16 hour cut off. After gritting my teeth through a tough second to last lap, it was finally time. The last lap. I proudly told each of the aid station volunteers that it was so and managed a decent final ""sprint"" to the finish line. And of course, it's not a polarchips long distance race without me crying profusely, which I very much did upon running through the finish gate. Tons of people were cheering for me. The people's champ. I felt so much love for all of the runners and support staff at the event, most of whom had stayed up all night with the runners. I tearfully expressed my gratitude to everyone and told the announcer how proud I was that I actually finished despite how close I was to quitting. I made it.

# Post-race

Took a taxi back to my hostel and attempted to watch UFC 296 but got inspired to fall asleep right after watching Bryce Mitchell get starched and have some sleepy time himself. After being awake for practically 28 hours, it was reasonable that sleep was in order. Woke up in time for dinner, ate, and then back to bed a few hours later.

Body wise, not feeling terrible. Jumped in an ice bath right after finishing (did that help, I have no idea). Walking was laboured, but possible the day of finishing. Stairs were a challenge, but doable. Today I feel similarily fatigued in my legs but mentally I feel great. Lots more good rest to come.

# Reflections

I've got some thinking to do of what comes next for me and my running. It sounds harsh, but I've come to the conclusion (for now) that honestly, I kind of just suck at marathon distance and beyond. Or at least I struggle with it in hot temperatures. But I've also just always been generally better at shorter distances, like 5K. Don't get me wrong, I am extremely proud of myself for what I was able to do in my first 100k, but I am ready for a change of pace and I think I am more naturally suited to shorter distances. Tentative plan is to take lots of rest and then start some strength training in the gym. I've been neglecting any major weight training for my legs and I think having done some for this race would have really helped me in the later stages. Once I get a solid strength base, I think I'll train for 5k or mile, Perhaps the marathon gets revisited a year or two down the line.

12:46:02 officially. 22/55 overall. Not a pretty run or a pretty time but I am incredibly proud of myself considering I almost decided to DNF twice. This race was about finishing. Thank you again to all the volunteers at the event who kept my spirits up. The bucket list 100k is DONE. This was the most physically challenging run of my life and I'm very proud of myself for getting it done.",running

Training

I started really getting into running last October-ish when I was training for the Ventura half marathon. For most of my life, I was anti-running and preferred anaerobic exercises. But something in me changed and I grew to love the sport and now I feel off on days that I don't run. 

I'm mainly focusing on training for the LA Marathon in March so a lot of my training has been longer, slower runs mixed with strength, but the smaller races keep it fun and interesting for me. I ran the race course about a month-ish before this race as part of a longer run, and I knew it was packed dirt and wanted to see if I wanted to break out the trail runners or use my usual Cloud surfers. I struggled with this run as the first part of the trail was sandy and felt like a beach run. After this I started to dread this race.

In the weeks leading up to this I was battling an Achilles injury and took a lot of time off of running to bike and do some rehab. The week before the race I unfortunately lost my pup of 15 years and didn't really do any training.

The last 5k I ran in June, I won first in my age division which I was super shocked at and I really wanted to repeat the win with this race, but was not hopeful based on my past month of training. 

Pre-race

On race day, I really did NOT want to run. I thought about not going. But I was meeting some friends at the race and decided I had to go. My new main goal was to just finish the course. 

I arrived at the race at about 7:30am, 1 hour before gun time, thinking I would have plenty of time to park, warm up and use the restroom. I was wrong. I didn't park until 8:10 which cut into all my pre race prep time. I chose to cut out the warm up to use the portable-potty for that pre race poop which turned into a toilet paper-less disaster. 

I made it to the front of the start line at about 8:20. The gun time was 8:25. I did some frantic stretches and leg swings just to do something before the start.

Race

Tears. Dust. Wind chill. Throw up. 

I started fast, a little too fast but that's to be expected of me. I was maybe the third to cross the start which encouraged speed. The first half mile was more sandy than a packed dirt trail and was difficult to run and I tired out quickly. After the packed sand area the sadness hit. Since loosing my dog I haven't been able to exercise without crying a little and this race was no exception. Instead of stopping, I pushed through this time. 

Since I had run this course in training, I knew it had to potential to be dusty, I just didn't think it would get as dusty as it did. I felt it in my eyes and my lungs, I was coughing a lot and I know others around me felt the dust too. I wished that I had a pandemic era mask to run with but settled for running with my shirt over my nose to try to filter out the dust for a little.

It was chilly but it wasn't cold in the morning, so I didn't think to wear a long sleeve. But during the first straight away, I was so cold my hands were purple. It wasn't windy but the trail is between the freeway and a golf course which maybe created some extra wind chill. I was freezing until midway through mile 1, when the course moved away from the freeway.

Through the whole race I was dry heaving/coughing partially because of the dust, but also probably because of my emotional state. I unfortunately threw up a little while on the course and took a break to walk a little. This is the moment where I thought I was going to give up and walk the rest of the way. But I persevered and started jogging again, thinking that my goal of a first place age group finish had passed me, my new goal was just to finish and be proud of myself. I really struggle to feel accomplished when I don't meet goals I set for myself, a side effect of growing up as a gymnast maybe. 

BAM! Mile 2 hits, the water station is there and suddenly I feel better running than I have in weeks. My self doubt dissolves and I think ""I fuckin' got this"" and I pick up the pace. I pass people that passed me ages ago and I feel revived. I use my usual method of trailing behind others then passing them when I feel like I have a burst of speed (which is also my MarioKart strategy). The last turn hits and I pick up the pace from 8:00/mi to a 7:30/mi, sprinting through the finish line. 


Post-race

I was proud that I finished. I don't think I have ever felt so spent crossing a finish line. This was the hardest race I have ever done. I jogged a little to cool off grabbed my snacks and water sat down in the grass and cried just a little. I pulled myself together, stretched a little and then headed back towards the finish line to cheer on my friends who are runner/walkers, I was lucky enough to stand by 3 dogs and got some needed puppy kisses as I waited. My friends crossed the finish line and they both got PBs! 

Results come in. I'm shocked to see that I finished first in my age group and in the top 3% of runners that day for the 5k with a 23:35 finish. I completed all my goals even with my hiccups. It wasn't a PB, especially with the course being short. 

In the pre-race hype up the emcee explained that this was a 5k-ish course and that our watches/phones were inaccurate sometimes, but I was thinking that maybe it would be short the last 0.1 mile, but it was short by a quarter mile which I was kind of disappointed at since I knew the trail had the potential to be a full 3.1 miles.

With my first place age group win, I won a little Charlie Brown Christmas Tree. 

Overall, not an ideal race, but I'm proud of myself for picking myself up and trying my best. Looking forward to my next 5k at the end of the month.

1538,1702746435.0,I Completed My First Marathon. Here's What I Learned,"As the title states, I completed my first marathon back in early November. I've been meaning to get around to making a post not only for myself for future reference but for others that are contemplating running their first marathon. Hopefully this can give you some guidance or confidence that completing a marathon can become a reality for you. This community was so helpful in my preparation that I feel obliged to make my contribution to others.  

To give a little history, I have always maintained a very active life style that typically involved weight training 4-6 times a week. Over the last 2-4 years I have consistently ran 1-2 times per week and the runs ranged from 2-6 miles. I definitely never considered myself of runner. I was always a stronger guy and just enjoyed being in the weight room. Running just wasn't easy for me as it was for others. 

Back in March of 2023 I found myself running a bit more than what I usually did and I was starting to enjoy it more instead of just running to say I did ""cardio"". My schedule was a very intimidating factor for me though. I am a full time doctorate student, I work part time, and I have twin 1 year olds. I was somewhat attracted to running a marathon just to see how committed and disciplined I could be to something with everything else going on in my life. 

**Training Program**
As others in this community lead me to this, I chose the Hal Higdon Training program for first time marathon runners. It seemed like it was doable and that if I was able to complete this 18 week program that I would be prepared for race day. Prior to the start of the 18 week program, my goal was to run a 15-20 mile weekly average to help build my base. Looking back, I think this was extremely beneficial and gave me a little cushion for weeks that I wasn't able to complete the necessary runs. And there were alot of weeks we I didn't run the exact amount of miles that I was suppose to - this is OK. As others will tell you, definitely make sure that you his the long runs and be consistent throughout the rest of the week. 

**Gear**
I know everyone has their brand of running shoes that they prefer. I would recommend finding 1-2 pairs of shoes and alternate between the two. For me, I had a newer pair of Brooks Ghost that I really liked and an older pair of New Balance shoes. I held off on wearing the brooks until closer to the date of my marathon just so I didn't have a ton of miles on that pair, but I also wanted my body to get use to them as well. A couple pairs of running shorts are also recommended. Most of my training runs were also very early morning as this was the only time I could really train (*I would highly recommend getting comfortable with early morning runs. You will have to sacrifice ALOT of time running during training and to avoid taking too much time away from your family just get comfortable with getting up early and knocking your runs out. Plus you feel amazing the rest of the day*). A good neck gaitor, gloves, and running hat/skull cap, and running belt to hold your cell phone are also recommended. Oh, and a head lamp for those early mornings runs. I got a cheap one off amazon that actually came in a pack of 2 that worked great. 

**Crosstraining**
Can't emphasis this enough. At least 1-2 days a week take time to perform strength training in whatever capacity you feel comfortable with. As someone who thoroughly enjoys weight lifting, I knew I would not be able to keep the same intensity that I had prior to marathon prep because so much energy is spent on running and my legs basically hurt all the time. Even when I felt like I didn't get a ""good workout"" in, I always felt better after and for my next run. 

**Diet/fueling strategy**
My goal going in to marathon prep was to not lose weight. I weighed ~205-210 lbs going into marathon prep, although relatively lean (*race day I weighed 200*). I knew I would be losing some muscle mass due to a different training regiment but I also knew that I was going to need to significantly increase my caloric intake due to burning alot more calories than what I was use to. Aside from just eating more throughout the day, I think my breakfast was a big part of my success. I would eat a big bowl of oat meal, scoop of protein powder, a whole banana, flax seeds, chia seeds, peanut butter, mixed frozen fruits (mostly strawberries and blueberries), honey, and cinnamon. This came out to about 600-700 calories and gave me the proper fuel that my body needed. I ate this breakfast was EVERY day. My body got use to this and expected this for fuel on my runs. Typically my shorter runs were fasted and I would eat this right when I got back home. Fueling during my longs runs consisted of Stinger Gel Packs and Electrolytes. I would take 12 ounces of electrolytes and a gel pack typically every 5 miles - on some runs I felt that I could've used it every 4 or so but I managed. 

**Discipline and Consistency**
As mentioned previously, this is something that really attracted me to trying to tackle a marathon. I was starting to get kind of bored with my prior workout routine - just felt like I was going through the motions and not really looking forward to my workout like I once was. I needed to switch things up. Training for a marathon teaches you discipline and consistency through proper dieting and committing time to put hour and hours in running. I really enjoyed this aspect. This type of discipline bleed out into others aspects of my life such as studying for school, balancing work, and keeping up with 2 one year olds in the house. My typical schedule was wake up at 4:40am and be done with my run, showered, breakfast, and getting the babies up by 7:00am. Work from 8-5, take care of the from 5-7 and the study from 7:15 until bed which was around 9:30 - 10p. Its ground hog day every day. 



Again, I can't thank this community enough for guiding me throughout this whole process. I finished my marathon in 4 hours and 35 minutes. As others will tell you, the first 18-20 miles feel pretty good. The last 6 is when the race really starts and it was an absolute grind. It was a fantastic experience though and I highly urge others to pursue this feat. For others, motivation to complete a marathon may be to lose weight, health issues, and many other reason. Those are all great externally motivating factors. Find what your motivation is and go for it. Running for me has been a massive mental benefit. I have better clarity and calmness throughout the day. I may do another marathon, I may not, but running is going to be a consistent staple in my life that is for sure.",running

\### Training

I am a middle of the pack runner (F37) who loves the shorter races and swore back in 2020 that I was one and done for the marathon. It took 3 years but I started to wonder if I could run a marathon and enjoy it. I used the Pfitzinger 18 week plan that peaked at 55miles. My goal was to listen to my body and remember that it is better to be a consistent B+ runner for the whole 18 weeks than an A+ runner who gets injured 6 weeks in. When I felt like I needed to cut back I would change the LT runs (tempo runs) into intervals and I cut back a lot of the marathon pace miles from the long run. My biggest confidence boosting workout was a Tuesday night 13m run with 6 miles at my half marathon pace. This monster run was the hardest part of my half marathon training and now I was running it on a weeknight!

Looking back on my training-I made my weekly mileage within 20% for 12 of 18 weeks but still set a new 5k PR (22:59) and ran a 1:53 half marathon over a giant bridge [https://imgur.com/gallery/qiQyUX3](https://imgur.com/gallery/qiQyUX3) (Highly recommend the La Porte Half marathon over the Fred Hartman bridge [https://laportebythebayhalfmarathon.org/](https://laportebythebayhalfmarathon.org/))

\### Pre-race

I got to the race 2 hours early and the vendors were still setting up. It was 41F (5C) and even though the race had propane heaters it was freaking cold and there was no place to sit so I was on my feet for 2 hours. Logistics were great as long as you take public transit. My only complaint was that the 4 hour pacer slid in at the very front of the corral and there was no way to get anywhere close.

\### Race

Leaving downtown we went out hot and downhill and I ended up running half marathon pace for the first mile. I settled in and felt great for miles 1-17. The Dallas marathon goes through some gorgeous neighborhoods and the crowds were so much fun! I swear I saw 8-9 tables handing out booze and there were a group of shirtless young men with a sign that said ""You flash us and we drink""! They were having a great time even though I didn't see anyone take them up on their offer. The hills on the way to White Rock Lake were hard. I normally train in the East Texas Bayous and my average elevation gain on a long run is 15ft over 18 miles. Thank goodness White Rock Lake is flat for miles 10-19. At mile 17 you look back at the skyline and feel so far away-thank goodness for the Dallas run clubs cheering section out there. It was the hill on the way out that broke me. I was right on pace for 4 hours but after climbing the hill you get to the top, turn left and instead of a downhill you have another uphill. It was carnage in the last 5k.

\### Post-race

I had a blast at this race and would highly recommend it-public transit was so easy, crowds were great, and fantastic weather (usually). The biggest lesson I learned was to train hills even if I have to use a treadmill to simulate elevation. I am walking away excited to run some shorter races again and also looking for another November/December marathon for next year. If anyone has suggestions especially for races down south let me know!

This was my third marathon. 42/f, started running in December 2021 after signing up for the Philly 8k as a family reunion activity. We were planning to walk it, but I got ditched by my 70+ year old cancer-survivor mom, who straight-up said ""I'm bored of walking"" at mile 3 and ran off, leaving my sister to follow her (because my mom didn't have anything to carry her phone in, so my sister had to hold her phone and run after her or we'd have lost her in the crowd; this has happened before) and abandoning me in the dust.

That was also the first time I'd seen marathoners in person. I remember looking at them and thinking ""wow, they seem so vital and energetic. I bet it's really awesome to live in a body that strong. I bet it just feels incredible *all the time.*""

I later discovered that this was only half right, and during the later weeks of a training block it mostly just feels like exhaustion and woe, but the rest of the time Runner Me is definitely an improvement on Non-Runner Me.

Anyway, I picked up running from absolutely zero athletic background, struggled through four months of misery as a newbie, got hooked around month 5, and did my first marathon (the frozen windy wonderland of Philly 2022) about a year later. Crashed and burned at mile 18 with massive GI distress, hobbled from porta-potty to porta-potty for the last 8 miles, finished around 5:23.

Tried the Philadelphia Marathon again in 2023, ran 4:26.

Three weeks later I ran Rocket City in Alabama. My parents live in Huntsville so it was a good excuse to see them around the holidays.

**Training**  
Followed the Hansons beginner program, more or less. I missed some of the shorter weekday runs due to work/life interference. Base mileage was around 35-40 mpw, going up to the mid-50s as the training plan intensified. Hit 60 mpw on peak week.

**Pre-race**  
Flew in on the Thursday before the race and stayed with my parents. The last few days before the marathon were all about family time, getting the kids together with their cousins, and making holiday memories. Sleep, nutrition, and tapering all fell by the wayside. I didn't stress about it, though, because this year's races were just about getting more experience at the marathon distance.

We did the Mural Run 5k as a family event the day before the marathon. My mom won her age group. I was pacing my 7-year-old son, who also did the Kids' Marathon. (Rocket City has a program where kids run a total of 25.2 miles from September - December leading up to the big day. Then the kids get to run the final mile as a double loop around the Von Braun Civic Center, ending with a finish through the same finish line arch that the adult marathoners use. It's really cool and the shirt design was awesome this year -- great experience, highly recommend for any parents looking to get their kids excited about running.)

I got a new pair of Novablast 3s and did a couple of easy 3-milers around my parents' neighborhood just to decide whether I wanted to run in Novablast 3s or 4s, but that was about it for pre-race prep.

The expo is small but solid. Good selection of gear and nutrition options, so if you forgot anything on the trip, it's easy to grab last-minute replacements.

**Race**  
Rocket City is a really fun race and I 100% recommend it if you're in the area. The race directors do a great job. It's a solid, well-organized race that pulls around 1000 marathoners each year, but it's also got some homespun quirks: the pre-race info packet is 12 pages of mostly jokes about pocket turtles, bag drop consists of one guy Sharpie'ing your bib number onto your gear bag, and when I bought a finisher sweatshirt at the merch booth, the lady running the checkout table asked whether she could have the hanger back, as she'd pulled it from her son's closet and he needed it for his actual clothes.

The race begins and ends inside the Von Braun Civic Center, which is super nice because you don't have to stand outside on a dark December morning and there are plenty of real bathrooms to use before the race.

No strict corral enforcement or wave starts. People are asked to line up near the pacers who correspond to their anticipated finish times, that's about it. The race isn't especially congested, though, and within the first half mile people seemed to gravitate into place. I never got blocked by crowding, which was a nice change from every big Philly race I've done. The worst congestion came around mile 14 when the back half marathoners join the course right before a long, steep hill, which means that mid-pack marathoners (like me) are liable to hit the slowest part of the half marathon crowd at the same time as this ginormous hill.

About a third of the course runs through residential neighborhoods where you can see people's holiday decorations (one house had an amazing Halloween/Christmas scene set up with a 12-foot-tall skeleton in a Santa hat presiding over a scene of skeletal holiday carnage). Another third of the course consists of historic downtown Huntsville + the Space and Rocket Center + the botanical garden, which had its Galaxy of Lights holiday display up. The Galaxy of Lights is not at its best at 10 am, but it's still nice to run through.

The last 30% or so of the course is pretty boring: stretches of dead brown office-park lawns, construction zones, featureless highways and bridges, etc. It's not terribly scenic, but it's a necessary evil to connect the dots on the fun sections, and it's pretty easy to tune out and focus on your running during these segments.  
Spectator support is sporadic. There isn't a ton of cheering the whole way through, which personally I'm fine with, since I don't especially enjoy people yelling at me when I'm struggling. But there are clumps of spectators in the residential areas and downtown, and what they lack in numbers, they make up for in enthusiasm. There was one whole gang all dressed up like Oompa Loompas with a Willy Wonka and Violet Beauregarde and all the other characters, and they were great.

All the aid station volunteers were great. Super friendly and efficient, and in the Space and Rocket Center, all the aid stations are staffed by military service members who were also extremely friendly, polite, and just a joy to encounter.

The pace team also did an excellent job. I went out with the 4:15 pace group and stayed with them until around mile 10, at which point I figured I could go a little harder and split off on my own. The pacer was excellent though. Maintained even splits, signaled all the aid stations and turns ahead of time, warned people about pot holes and uneven pavement, kept up a steady conversation for people who wanted to talk. Just a stellar guy. Everybody should be so lucky as to have pacers like that.

The big selling point of this race is that you get to run past ACTUAL SPACE ROCKETS!! THAT HAVE BEEN TO SPACE!! and you know what, it is incredible to run past SPACE ROCKETS midway through a marathon. These things are \*huge\* when you see them up close. It's unbelievable that we just threw a bunch of these enormous things up into space and then got them back somehow and now you can run past them in a marathon and your race-addled brain can just explode about that for a couple of miles.  
  
At that point in the race I was full-on delirious (in a good way) and just kept yelling ""ROCKETS!! THERE ARE ROCKETS!! ROCKETS!!"" at everyone I encountered. I assume they thought I was the biggest idiot in the world. They're not wrong.

**Post-race**  
This time, in contrast to Philly 2023, I remembered to eat all my snacks. Took either a packet of Sport Beans or a couple of sugar cookies every 3 miles, drank a cup of Powerade and a cup of water at every aid station, never hit the wall. Ran strong and felt good the whole time, which is a first for me.

I could probably have gone harder throughout, and for sure I left some time on the table, but I'm not complaining. 4:13 is a great time for me and I'm really happy with it. This year, my main goal was to finish a marathon without dying, and I did that. Next year I'll worry more about actually trying to race the whole distance.

The course did measure a little long for me. Garmin clocked it at 26.6 miles, which isn't surprising since there are a lot of turns on the course and I'm not great at running tangents. (For comparison, my Garmin clocked the Philly course at 26.7.)  
  
I would still strongly consider Rocket City for a hypothetical future PR run, though. Although there are a lot of turns and it's a rolling hill course with a couple of steeper climbs, there aren't any serious bottlenecks and I always felt like I had room to manuever on the course, which has not always been my experience.

tl;dr: Rocket City is a fun, well-organized midsized race and an excellent choice if you're looking for a good marathon in the Southeast U.S.

## Training

I started running in February 2022. On a whim, I decided to run my first half in April (2:24:59) at my hometown half. After that, I kind of got addicted to running. I continued to run throughout the summer, before deciding to attempt a marathon. 

I chose the Dallas Marathon for sentimental reasons: Dallas is where I went to undergrad, started my career, and met my husband. I am an avid collector of memories, so Dallas checked all the boxes for this big first.

I did Hal Higdon's Novice 2 training plan, since I had a fairly good base (could run 5+ miles without stopping or feeling winded), and I wanted something a little more challenging than Novice 1. 

I was fairly faithful to the plan. I only skipped one long run (13.1) because I was sick, and the handful of weekday runs I skipped were only short ones; I usually made up the missed miles later in the week. (Tue/Thu were short, 4-5 miles; Wed were medium, 6-8 miles; Sat were long, 10+ miles.)

I cleaned up my diet (more lean meat, less artificial sugar, zero alcohol); incorporated some strength training and yoga; and got good gear to support longer and colder runs, as I live in Denver. I also obsessively crafted my race day playlist so specific songs played at specific parts of the course.

Training went well. I experienced some right knee swelling up until the last 25% of training, and wore a compression brace. As the miles got longer, I also experienced piriformis pain in my right cheek that was instantly alleviated by leaning back (""lead with your hips, not your face"") and upping my cadence. Thanks to /r/running for the tips! By race day, I was running 100% pain-free.

In my last long run (20 miles), I experienced nausea at the 14-mile mark. That day, I had chugged a ton of Nuun from my pack before running because I was particularly thirsty. I assumed the pain was from gas because Nuun is ""lightly effervescent,"" but I never got an answer. The bad quality of my last long run lined my confidence with an edge of nervous energy.

I began having stress dreams about failing. These dreams woke me up around 3AM every single night of my taper, three weeks leading up to the race. 

Interestingly, I slept perfectly fine the night before the actual race. I figured by that point, I had failed this race a dozen times in my dreams, so what was one more time?

## Pre-race

*Nothing new on race day!* 

I ate oatmeal with brown sugar and honey two hours before the race and only sipped my Nuun. At the starting line, I snacked on a small package of electrolyte gummies. Even though I had been running pain-free in the weeks leading up to the race, I opted to wear compression braces on both knees, as a precaution.

I registered with a target ""worst case"" pace of 12:00 min/mile, so I started the race in Corral D (which the organizers referred to as ""Corral D + Walkers,"" ouch). My husband was in Corral B but fell back to D to start the race with me and make it easier for our parents to catch us at cheer stations along the course.

## Race

The first 10 miles went off without a hitch! I felt amazing - lungs full (Denver air always feels thin), heart strong, legs fresh! Per routine, I ate a Gu around mile 5. I did accidentally stab myself with a safety pin while trying to rearrange my bib, which wasn't ideal. Please send recs for non-stabby bib holders!

For the first time, I didn't feel nervous about being able to run a marathon. I even got optimistic about finishing under the 5-hour mark because I felt so good! I was closer to my ""best case"" pace of 10:00 min/mile than my ""worst case"" pace!

Then I hit mile 10.

Around mile 10, I experienced a sharp pain in my upper abdomen. The pain was accompanied by an intense need to vomit. I slowed to a walk, aggressively massaged my upper abdominal area, and sipped Nuun from my hydration pack. I began taking water at the aid stations, instead of drinking my Nuun, in case the issue was gas. I ate another Gu at mile 11, which neither helped nor hurt. Walking felt fine, but as soon as I started to run again, the pain returned.

It was around the halfway point that I looked out over the lake and saw the Dallas skyline on the distant horizon. This was a mistake, because I realized I still had *SO FAR* to go to make it back to the finish line. I told my parents at a cheer point that I was NOT well, and that I'd be too slow. I told them to go on ahead and cheer for my husband at the finish line; that was more important than watching my protracted suffering.

I stopped at mile 14 to use a port-o-potty, but nothing happened up or down, just a little tinkle. The inability to continuously jog without severe pain meant I walked the uphills and lightly jogged or powerwalked the downhills and straightaways. This meant my pace goals were completely destroyed.

Miles 19-21 are a sheer uphill out of the lake. It was here that I was able to watch my husband cross the finish line on Google Maps, as well as do some mental math for my own finish time. I saw my sub-5 dreams go out the window and cried, mourning the loss of what I felt was a ""good"" time that I should've easily been able to hit, given my training performance.

I was angry at myself, angry at my body, angry at the time I wasted, only to be unable to perform. I wallowed for a bit, then decided there was nothing I could do to change things, so I might as well conserve my energy and make the best of a crappy situation.

Somewhere in mile 22, I was walking next to a battered-looking guy who was running the ultramarathon - his first since high school, which was *a while* ago. To quote him, **""I don't know what the hell I was thinking when I signed up for this.""** We bonded over how masochistic we must be to run this far for fun. This sense of community lifted my spirits.

Sensing that I was having a tough time, my dad broke off from the finish line crowd to meet me at mile 23 and tell me he was proud of me for doing this really hard thing. I cannot tell you how big a difference it made to know that even though the miles were quiet and lonely, I wasn't alone. This brought some joy back to my race experience.

There were no mile markers for 25 and 26, so the last 5k felt brutal and endless. When I rounded the corner into downtown, I fast-forwarded to some Taylor Swift and envisioned the finish line.

I rounded the final corner and, in full view of the supporter stands, tripped on literally nothing. My legs were just too tired to fully pick up my feet. I didn't go all the way down, but I did flail wildly. Not as embarrassing as shitting oneself, but still pretty awkward.

20 steps later, I saw 6:08:07 on the race timer. The official course cut-off was 6 hours. When I saw the time on the board, I began to fall apart. I hid my crying until I crossed the finish line.

## Post-race

A kind, motherly volunteer put a foil blanket over me and told me I did a great job and should be proud. I don't remember someone putting a medal over my head. I don't remember smiling and giving the cameraman a thumbs-up.

I do remember that all of the snacks and swag were long gone, the tables broken down and the boxes empty. A kid handed me a package of brownie bites. I had registered for an XS finisher shirt, but they were out, so I got a small instead. It is too baggy. It is one of my favorite shirts.

The cumulative fatigue hit me all at once, and I fully broke down after getting through the finisher chute. My husband got to me first, and I let it all out on his shirt. I was so upset that I had failed, that I had missed the 6-hour course cut-off, that I couldn't push past the pain, that *I hadn't planned for something unexpected* to go wrong. I had told people - other runners - that I was going to run this race - what would they think of my time? (Newsflash: Nobody cares about my time but me.)

He told me I hadn't missed the cut-off at all, that my chip time was actually 5:39:07 (my then-unofficial time); the time on the board was from the overall race start, not my specific start time. Duh-doy!

I drank half a jar of cold pickle juice my mom had brought for me. That pickle juice was my ambrosia. Husband and I hobbled to our hotel, showered, and went out for a Tex-Mex dinner where our parents celebrated us like we had just set Olympic world records.

## Reflections

Now that the dust has settled on my running shoes, I have mixed feelings about this experience.

On one hand, I really thought I would do better. In fact, I KNOW I am capable of doing better. Training was great right up until the last long run. I didn't have any upward or downward movement of my pain after the race, so I'll never know what caused it. (I *did* start my period the next morning...very suspicious...) I'm going to do more long runs to see if I can pinpoint the cause through trial and error.

I'm disappointed, I'm embarrassed, but most of all, I'm just kind of sad.

But on the other hand, I'm proud, too. Until 2022, I loathed running. I joined the cross country team in 8th grade to lean into my anorexia and lose weight, but I was so slow that they always asked me NOT to run at meets because my time would bring down the team average. 

When we moved to Denver in 2019, I couldn't even run half a mile. I still remember the day I continuously ran one mile on the treadmill. I remember the day I set my one-mile PR, a Usain-like 9:21 lol. And, how many people run marathons?! That number is both a lot, and also very, very little.

I started a [Turtle Runners](https://www.strava.com/clubs/RedditTurtleRunners) group on Strava to connect with other slow runners like me, who aren't out to ""win"" races, but rather to enjoy the long, slow miles we share. (It gets LONELY at the back of the pack when the support crowd is thin, the water stations are gone, and the good snacks are gone, taken by better, faster runners.) I started going to a local run club and have met amazing, inspiring runners of all abilities who have encouraged me to keep going. When I see other people finish a marathon, no matter their time, I am SO PROUD OF THEM. So why can't I be proud of myself? **It is unkind.**

Running has been a journey of healing for me, of getting to finally live in a place of gratitude for all that my body has allowed me to do. 

All of us were out there on Sunday morning to answer one big question: *can I do hard things?* 

It doesn't matter if you're chasing that answer from the elite line or the ""Corral D + Walkers"" line; if you finish, or even if you just try really damn hard, the answer is *yes*.

With these things in mind, I woke up the next morning to the realization that the only way to find out if I can do better, is to try.

Now taking 2024 marathon recommendations.

New here, my name is Ellis, recently gotten back into running although due to a leg condition can only get to 6k-7k at a push, but I am looking at using my holidays in 2024 to do various running camps around Europe.

  
I've signed up to one in the Algarve for 7 nights in April - algarverunningcamp on FB and IG - which is all inclusive, with activities too, apart from flights (if anyone happens to be going or books too, let me know as it would be nice to chat before meeting there).

  
I would like to find more if anyone has any recommendations, ideally ones you have been to and can share experiences of.

  
I have been looking at a high altitude one in St Moritz in the Swiss Alps in September just for something a little different, and another in Mallorca in October. If I can avoid the 30c+ temperatures that would be good.

  
Ideally camps including at least 1 meal a day with facilities to cook, or all inclusive in terms of meals would be great.

  
Maybe see you in Portugal in April.

  
Look forward to your suggestions!

1562,1702392316.0,29 and my first cleared marathon: very uphill challenge but I made it,"I just finished my first cleared marathon at 6:19:45 a few weeks ago. Not a very great time, but I’m incredibly proud of myself.

(Working on the image, on my mobile phone => can’t use imgur. You can check https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/s/2SLgcl26lG in the meantime)

So, I discovered that I got Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome at 22 years old; it’s a inborn heart disease. This explains my much failed health since youth. By 23, after 3-4 sessions at hospital (they couldn’t “awake” the syndrome in the first few times), I managed to fix it. Still, by now, if you had first hand experiences of that syndrome, you would be very… tired of living, and feel that each day is your last day, kinda carpe diem. I got cardiac arrests during that time, where my heart rate go up to 200-220 a few times. I really never know if I might die tomorrow.

The experience really changed my life and my characters upside down. By 24, I jump from 75kg to 95kg. Lot of stress from life and work and so on.

Then, yeah, I got a stroke at 26. Partially paralyzed the right side of my body. Another shock at work just a few months after that really hampers my attitude toward life. Coupling with Covid social distancing policy, i have my worst three months of my life.

It is only through Eastern Medicine and Physiotherapy (yeah, Western doesn’t work well on my case) that I kinda have a good recovery. Also, my new job kinda reinforces my positive attitude.

After 2 years, February 2023, my Doc said I can engage in physical activities. Well, it kinda matches the period where my current company starts to motivate its employees to run for better health and charity (every mile => increase the value the company will give charity). 

So, I ran. As Norman Vincent Peale said ""Shoot for the Moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars""; so, I aim for a marathon from the start, that I will achieve it on my birth month (September 2023).

Haha I was still very heavy, around 95kg. So for the first month, I walk first, from a mile, then I increase day by day then 5 mile at the end of the month. Then I start to run.

By then, I understand that my weight and my body composition will be a challenge to my marathon. I set rules (not completely changing my diet, just light rules like have 5 aloe vera yoghurt a week or have longer sleeps or have less rice for dinner) and abide by it.

By July 2023, I’m 83.5kg. Then, I understand that I need a test, aka a half marathon, and that if I make it 2:30-2:45, I stand a chance to finish my marathon. So took it in the first week of August, about 3 hours (cap time is 4 hours)

I think that if I run more intensively, I might be able to finish my marathon on time on September (cap time is 6:30 hours).
I was completely wronggg. I took 7 hours and a bit more, missed COT.

My mentor told me, while my mileage is ok-ish, I need to train other parts of my body more, aside from legs. Also, the weather (short rain then very sunny), the route (… damn bridge, very high elevation) could be reasons to my downfall. But most important factor is that I’m not in the zone, that I believe I can finish the race on time.

So I train and train more, down to 80.25kg. I also choose a race at my hometown, that I can be more familiar with the road, not thinking twice if I lost. My last long run, which is a week before the race, took 1:52:40 for 10 miles. Not a bad time. I believe that with luck, I can even do it less than 6 hours (cap time 6:30:00)

It proved all true in the first 13km, I took 1:30. At the 14th km, I nearly sprained my ankle from a hole (yeah, a hole) on the road. It creates huge stress on my right leg, my pace down to 9:00 a km (around 14 min a mile) for the next 2km. I try to go 7:00 from 15-20km, but I still have to cool it down.

I took 2:41:04 for first half, not bad. But my pace is very slow (pace 9 for 10min then walk 2 min, according to a strategy I read on marathonbasic.com). Km 14-34 is really the challenge, not sure if I can really finish it. By km34, I finish the hardest part of the race: a lake that took 13km to go around it. Pretty sure I can finish on time. 

Then at km37, 5 km left, I still have 80 minutes. Then, I just walk. Not because of physical weariness. Sub-6 is too challenging at this point. But 6:30 cap time is easy lah. Pretty much my Hail Mary. Kinda enjoy the last run period of a great phase that took 9 months, 15kg, lots of blood and sweat.

Yeah, I made it. A marathon is a great achievement for everyone, but particularly for me, it could be the peak of my life. Who knows, aiming for sub 5 April 2024; then, if achievable, sub 4 September 2024.

Many people help me on my road to this success and I really appreciate it. My boss (haha, never ran in his life and still sign up for a marathon in Feb 2023, owned by life by km28, but inspiring), my colleagues (my mentor from the same company) my friends, my family (got the Nike Zoomx Invincible as a gift, retiring it this week after 1100 km walk and run) among many others. But, most important, not being narcissist, me, for not giving up.",running

### Training
This was my second marathon.  The first was in March of this year and I got injured two months before the race and was woefully unprepared for it, but I paid for the race and I was going to run it anyway.  Finished in 5:13 and was unhappy about the way everything went so I signed up for the BCS marathon in which was about 9 months later and decided I wanted to run a sub 4 marathon.  I started to lift after recovering from the marathon and slowly worked up my miles before starting a training plan. I decided on the Hal Hidgon Advanced 1 plan and followed it very closely only skipping a few runs due to life getting in the way. The plan started with about 30 mi/week and peaked at 60 mi/week.  I ran 3 runs of 20 miles with a 10 mile marathon pace run the day before to better represent the feeling of running on tired legs.  To convince myself that the training (time and pain) was worth it, I ran a half marathon a month before the race and set a half PB by 13 minutes (1:42 finish time). Obviously that give me hope for the sub 4 marathon. 

### Pre-race
I arrived in College Station, TX on the Friday before the race and visited some people at Texas A&M and took everything very easy. I spent almost all of Saturday (other than getting lunch and dinner, and the expo) in my hotel room conserving energy. 
The morning of the race I woke up at 4:45 AM got all of my kit together and relaxed until 5:45 AM when I drove to the parking lot near the start line of the marathon. I sat in my car for about 30 minutes because it was only 43 degrees out the the wind was blowing at 10 mph, before getting out to stretch and warm up. 

### Race
My plan was to stick with the 4 hour pace group for a good portion of the race before picking up my pace. This was a great plan.  The first 4-5 miles felt perfect despite the cold and windy conditions.  There was a group of about 15-20 all running with the 4 hour pace group. At mile 4 or so we hit the first of several rolling hills that lasted for several miles. Other than a couple of the hills the race went by so quickly because of the great conversions that we were having that it all is a blur in my memory.  At the half way point the pacer told us to wait to separate from group till later and it was great advice. A few people did not heed this advice and we caught up with them by mile 19.  We continued on talking away having a great time cheering with the spectators. At mile 18 or 19 the course entered the campus of Texas A&M where there was more people cheering everyone on. At mile 20 I was still feeling great thanks to the split long run weekends and started to think about picking up the pace. A little before the 22 mile mark I decided it was time to push my pace and separated from the group that I had been running with for the last three hours. At mile 23 and 24 my watch told me my pace was an 8:11 and my legs were still feeling better than I could have ever expected so I kept pushing.  Then just before mile 25 we turned a corner and the head wind that we had been dealing with on and off all day was back with a vengeance. The head wind wiped my out and slowed me down by about 35-40 seconds/mile, but I knew I had to keep it up.  The finish line was almost in sight.  Finally the moment came where I could hear the crowd and emcee at the finish line and ""sprinted"" into the finish line 3 minutes ahead of my goal! I was so happy I forgot to stop my watch and didn't remember till 2 minutes later.

### Post-race
After stopping and crossing the finish line, my legs finally got their message through to my brain.  There were hurting.  Every step sucked. It hurt to go up the curb, hurt to put one foot in front of the other, but I knew if I sat down I was getting up.  I quickly found the sports drink and slammed down 3 bottles (one of each flavor). After watching the others from the 4 hour group come in I left and went back to the hotel, showered, and left to make the 3 hour drive back home.  
The next day my legs only hurt a little, especially compared to how bad they had felt the day after the marathon in March. Two days after the race (today) my legs feel ready for a run, but I have come down with a case of the marathon flu.  
Overall it was a great time and I meet a lot of great and wonderful people on the course.

**Training**  
I started running in February of this year just to get back into being active after finishing college athletics. I had always hated running because I was always the slow one, so I wanted to challenge myself to learn to enjoy it. Had no intentions of running even one race this year, but I fell in love with running and decided to sign up for Kiawah since it's nearby. I started officially training in July (in the hot SC heat) with the goal to run the race under 5 hours. I was running 11-11:30 min/mile at the time and didn't think I'd be able to do much more than that when I started. My first half marathon in training was a 2:25. I had incredible newbie gains though and improved astronomically over the course of my training block, especially as the weather started to cool down here. I ran a tune-up half marathon a few weeks prior to the race as part of my 20-miler and finished in 1:52, which put it in my mind that maybe I could go sub-4, but I didn't want to put pressure on myself as I had never done the full marathon distance before and decided on a 4:15 goal. 

Overall, training went off without a hitch. I didn't deal with any injuries, though I did get really sick in September and lost about 10 pounds. Couldn't run for around 10 days, but just resumed where I had left off and it turned out fine. I was running 4-5 days per week, and I stuck with a pretty low volume (35-40mpw) since truthfully I just wanted to be able to finish and I was knee-deep in medical school so free time was hard to come by. I think for my next training block, I'll try to incorporate more strength training (read: any strength training).  
**Pre-race**  
I consciously ate more the week leading up to the race to make sure I wasn't depleted and took in a ton of carbs and electrolytes for the two days before. Day of, I woke up at 4am and had a couple Eggo waffles with maple syrup and some coffee to get things moving. I learned during training that I have a stomach of steel so truthfully I wasn't too worried about it--just wanted to get some simple carbs in. My brother dropped me off at the shuttles at 5:45, and I ran into one of my professors in line for the shuttle! This was super fun and we were able to chat and get some of the pre-race jitters out. Got to the venue a little after 6am and sat in the conference center. Found some friends and stretched out. I was able to use an actual bathroom instead of a porta-potty, which was amazing. Got into the race corral at about 8am (race was delayed 10 minutes) and lined up behind the 4:15 pacer. The start line was super cramped and narrow, so I knew my first mile would be pretty slow.  
**Race**  
As predicted, the first mile was really congested. The pacer ended up speeding up well over the pace in the second mile to make up time. Stuck with the 4:15 group until the half marathon broke off at around mile 7 or 8; I was feeling pretty good so I pushed out ahead and stuck by myself for the rest of the race. I was taking caffeinated gels and Clif bloks about every 30 minutes or so (stomach of steel) and grabbing some gatorade at the aid stations. It was pretty humid, but thankfully I had done most of my training in similar or worse conditions. Those middle miles were tough because there were no spectators--Kiawah is a private island and back towards the golf course it was completely dead. Saw my parents at around mile 16 and felt amazing at this point. Then came a four-mile loop that I thought was gonna be the death of me. It started pouring down rain, which helped cool it off some as it was around 70 degrees by this point, but my shoes and socks were soaked through. I was nervous about blisters and chafing, but thankfully was spared that fate. 

When I saw my parents again at around mile 20, things were starting to hurt. They rode their bikes next to me for a couple miles, just telling me to focus on someone up ahead and pick them off one by one. My heart rate was in the 190s at this point (I'm 23 for context), but I knew I could hold it for a while because I've always run a little high and truthfully I'm just stubborn. Cardiovascularly, I was actually feeling pretty good given my heart rate, no symptoms or chest pain or anything. My average for the race was 182bpm. 

I walked through the water station at mile 21 and went to stretch out my quad (flat course really sucks) and felt like it was about to cramp up, so I just told myself no more stretching and tried to just hold my technique as steady as I could for the last few miles. Kept my mom in my mind for those miles between 21-24; my pace had slowed a little bit but I didn't feel like I was hitting a wall. I couldn't get any gels down after mile 20. 

At mile 24, I found my friends with a bunch of signs. This gave me a second wind. I kept seeing people up ahead of me start to walk and used them as goalposts. At this point, I just wanted to out-grit the people in front of me; my competitive streak came out in full force for sure. My hips and my quads were aching but I knew I didn't want to walk. The last mile I think I fully dissociated.

When I got to the finish line, I kicked as hard as I could. My calf started to cramp right as I was approaching the finish, but I ignored it because I didn't want everyone to see me cramp lol. Immediately started ugly crying as I crossed the line and found two more of my friends who were waiting for me. I feel so lucky that I had so many people willing to come out and support me.  
**Post-race**  
Walked around the post-race party for a while to give my muscles a chance to recover. I saw my chip time and was a little disappointed that I didn't break 4 hours, but I knew I didn't have anything left in the tank and that I had completely blown my original expectations out of the water. I downed an ice cold diet coke (was dreaming about this from mile 14 on), but wasn't hungry enough to eat yet. I changed and hung around for a couple hours to watch another one of my friends finish her race. My friends took me out to get food and I had my first beer in over a month. Was super sore for a couple of days but feel pretty much back to normal today. Overall, I'm so proud of myself and I can't wait for the next one. Now that I know what I'm capable of, I'm going to target that sub-4. Running has truly become an addiction and I'm just grateful that my body has the ability to do this.

### Training
I been running off and I'm since 2011 when I did my first 5k and then Half marathon at this very race. Sometimes I would fall off for a few months then get back into it. Never had an interest in a marathon. 

During quarantine I really got back into running, it was my outlet for stress. Starting adding more mileage and found my long runs being a half marathon every Sunday. Eventually I started increasing those and when I managed 18 I signed up for my marathon in December 2021.

I ran it, did tons of rookie mistakes and came out with a 4:30 time. Knowing I could do better I immediately signed up for a February marathon where I did my PR  of 3:51. Since then I settled into doing 3 marathons a year and this was my 7th one. 

Training wise I'm ""lazy"" where I just run. I don't do speed work, Hill work, etc. I just enjoy getting out and getting miles in. My usual marathon training peaks around high 40 miles per week with an 18 and 20 miler. 

This year I did a late Aug marathon in Mexico so I did a lot of training in the miserable Texas heat which I think really built up a strong base that I carried on for the rest of the year. 

### Pre-race
I actually was hit by a car during a run a month from the race, which I was thankfully able to walk away from. It set back my training but I was not injured and soon was feeling back to normal. 

Week before the race I started feeling like I was going to be sick. Rested up, took extra hydration including dayquill, orange juice and Gatorade. I wasn't feeling 100% until Sunday morning. Once I was dressed and I'm on my way to the race I was feeling pretty normal. 

Carb loading was nothing special. I had a baked potato every night the week of the race, with chicken thighs and veggies. Breakfast day of race was a bagel with coffee. 

I took the rail system to downtown, as I can park my car in the lot and don't worry about parking. Got there 40 min before race start which gave me time to walk, use the restroom and get into my coral without rushing.

### Race
Weather was in the high 30s so I was wearing shorts, tanktop and arm sleeves. I run hot so I knew anything more would be uncomfortable. 

Since I was feeling good I decided to aim for that 3:50 new PR. 

My marathon fueling strategy was gu every 4.5 miles and alternatingwater/Gatorade at every water station. 

And of course take any whiskey/beer/bloody Mary shots. 

The race was very crowded which helped me not start out too fast. I fought the urge as people started passing me and soon settled into a low 8:40 pace for the first miles. I usually break down later in the race so I wanted to bank this time. 

The first seven miles were a slow incline with some rolling hills (for Dallas) that never felt very uncomfortable. After mile eight it was a steep decline and entry into White Rock Lake a 9 mile mostly flat loop that is where most Dallas runners train and run. It's both nicely familiar but also very boring, as I done this section hundreds of times. 

By mile 16 I was feeling strong and had found many of my splits now in the low 8:30s. 

The most challenging part was coming up at miles 18 to 20, which is the most incline in the course and where I slowed down previous years. This time I flew through them, not changing much of my pace. It was at this point that I started thinking I could PR. I was feeling strong but with 6 miles to go I was just waiting for the cramps. 

They never came!

At 21 it just felt like I was in a long run. Not easy, a bit uncomfortable but I wasn't dying. I was making mental calculations like "" okay if I slow down to 10 min mile my time would still be xxx"" in case I needed to, but that never came. 

At 24 it was when it almost finally started to become too much and I could feel the exhaustion. But still no cramps, though I had to keep shaking out my left arm. I kept pushing, and pushed till the end. 

Crossed the finish line and felt sore, tired and emotional but probably the best physically I ever felt after crossing a finish line. 

I was amazed that I managed under 3:45 (barely) and teared up.",running
1571,1702324092.0,Anyone have experience with the Fitly Sub180? Buying a hydration vest....,"Hi Everyone!

Thanks for even reading this.  You guys are all such a help with your posts.

I am approaching the halfway point in my training for the **LA Marathon** (my first 26.2, btw) and my long runs are getting longer...Looking into hydration vests for those runs as I go 15+ miles.  The pack I seem to hear the most positive discussion about is the **Salomon Advance Skin 5**.  If anyone has opinions otherwise I am happy to listen!  Also, I have never used a bladder before so wondering if going that route is a mistake.  I like the Salomon Adv Skin because it seems to have both options.

That being said I just came across this company **FITLY** which seems to mostly do non-hydration running packs.  Anyone have any experience with them or more specifically the **Fitly Sub180 which includes a 1.1L bladder and a 250ml soft flask.** I can find next to zero reviews anywhere on this pack, which might answer my question right there.  But thought I would put it out to you guys to see if anyone has something to say.

### About
42 Year Old Male
6' 200lb

Sorta ran in my late 20s, stopped for 12ish years, ran really inconsistently in 2022, started regularly running in 2023. I tried out Zone 2 training in Feb which really clicked with me, and ended up running more in 2023 than I ever did in my twenties. Early summer I felt like I needed to mix things up and decided to aim for a half marathon.

### Training
Spend first part of year building aerobic base with mostly zone 2 runs. Had a nagging foot/calf/Achilles issue that cropped up in May and August when my miles per week went over 15mi, so had to take a couple two week breaks. Started the Higdon 12 week beginner half marathon in August with a few small changes to get it to fit my schedule. Mileage peaked at week 10 with 10 mile long run and 23 miles total, followed by a 2 week taper.

I did pretty good with the training schedule, but did miss my long run in week 9  due to being sick, and I cut out a couple of my short runs before my taper because my foot issue started to flare up again.

Tapered 66% 2 weeks out, and 50% week of. 

### Pre-race
The race started a 7:30 AM, so I woke up at 5:00, had a banana and toast with peanut butter, coffee and water. Weather was super foggy and right around freezing, but no rain. 

I run super hot so was in shorts, a wind breaker, hat, gloves and my running vest since I like to have frequent short sips of water and wanted somewhere to stash my jacket/hat/gloves. I also took 6 gels since I knew I was going to be on the course for at least 2.5 hours.

Left the house about 6:30 with my wife who was also doing the half, parked and started walking to the starting area around 7:00 just as the full started. It was so foggy that we heard the runners coming before we could see them emerge out of the fog which was pretty neat.

We got to the staging area with about 20 minutes to spare, so I used the porta pottys and did some light warmup exercises.  The race didn't feel super big, there were plenty of toilets and lines weren't a big issue. This being my 2nd race (other was just a 5k), I glad to feel more excited than nervous, and I think the smaller/lower key atmosphere helped. If it was a bigger race, I think nerves would have been worse.

There weren't really corrals, so everyone just lined up in the street roughly around the pacers. I packed my jacket right before the start, and we were off without too much fanfare.

### Race
Plan was to keep roughly 12:00 min/mi pace for the first half of the race, see how I felt, and try to get closer to 11:00 in the second half. I planned on gels about every 20 mins.

First mile was flat or mostly downhill through downtown Seattle, then onto the express lanes on I-5. Hat and gloves off, but forgot first gel. Pavement was pretty slick, and icy in a few spots I think. Saw at least one runner fall. Miles 2-5 were in the express lane tunnels and bridge, and were more rolling that I had anticipated, but not too bad.

Mile 6 was a hot mess logistically, the route exited express lanes onto streets, which then fed onto a narrower bike path. This also occurred right where the full marathon detour met back up with the half route, there was an aid station, and a big patch of ice all within a 1/4 mile which made for a huge mess. The timing worked out so that 3:30 marathoners were meeting up with us much slower 2:30 half marathoners, so there was a lot of traffic that took another mile to sort out, and I saw one more runner take a fall in this section.

The next couple of miles were flat on the bike path, and had a fun detour through gasworks park which had probably the best cheering section. I was still sticking roughly to my planned pace, but it was feeling harder than expected due to the earlier elevation. I also felt something weird on my toes which I later learned was a blister letting loose which was annoying because I had basically zero blisters in these shoes during training. 

Miles 8 and 9 were by far the hardest, there was a short, steep hill up to a highway, which then fed into a 1.5 mile long uphill. I had to slow way down on this part. I might have been able to push a little more than I did, but my HR was pretty high and I didn't want to blow up, so I just kept trucking in the 13'-14' pace, which due to my Zone 2 training was a pretty familiar place to be. 

Mile 10 the big hill was over which was a huge relief, and I was also past the longest run I had done in my life which was a boost. I was pretty tired and my feet were hurting, but still doing okay. Was leap-frogging several small groups of run walkers during this section, which was interesting to see the different strategies play out over a race.

The last few miles had one more smaller hill over a bridge and then was mostly flat to the finish. Was more tired than expected as the long hill really kicked my butt, but I was able to do a little bit of a last minute kick to the finish.

Got my medal, met up with my faster wife who was waiting for me, and headed home.                                                            

### Final Thoughts
Overall a good experience. 

Logistics-wise, the race felt a little slap-shod. That made it feel less high stakes which was good for me as a first timer, but things like mile markers were really irregular, missing or not visible. The section where the half and full met was a traffic nightmare, and I'm shocked I didn't see more falls there.

The hilly section towards mile 9-10 was just separated from traffic by cones, so that felt a little unsafe.

I was tired and legs and feet were sore, but felt pretty good afterwards. I hit 2/3 goals, and plan on doing another half in the spring or summer.

### Training
I was NEVER a runner growing up. But with a lot of time on my hands during quarantine, I desperately needed a new hobby, and I signed up for a February 2021 virtual half marathon. I’ve now repeated this cycle 3x- training all fall for a late winter/early spring half marathon with varying commitment levels and correlated success. But summer training in Texas inevitably breaks my spirit, and I end up starting from scratch every fall with zero aerobic base. 

This July though, my Apple Watch said my VO2 max was a miserable 23.3, and I was determined to fix that. So in the peak of a summer with 55 degrees above 100, I turned to the treadmill. I checked 80/20 Running out of our local library, took notes of the training plans included, and got to work!

I followed the Level 2 10K plan, which is a 12 week build with 1 day off every three weeks. Most weeks were structured with a speed workout, a tempo workout with a fast finish, a long run, and 4 days of “foundation” zone 2 running. I also did 2-3 hours of boxing, which helped me build muscle. 

For the first few months, I was also supplementing an additional 45 minutes of incline walking in Zone 2 every day purely trying to increase my aerobic base. Working in zone 2 was HUMBLING. I spent almost three months working my way up from 1 min running/2 min walking to fully running (and still only at about a 12 min/mile pace). 

The speed workouts and fast finishes made me confident I could run fast when the time came. In mid-October, I was simply not in the mood to do a long run, so I decided to test my 5K instead, and I came in at 30:19. Never in my life had I run so fast for so long, and it was the boost I needed to keep training with my eyes on my 10K PR from 2020 at 1:07. 

### Pre-race
I was eyeing either the BMW Dallas 10K the following weekend as my goal race, but I for some reason forgot to actually sign up? However, the week leading up to the race my immune system was only feeling 90% functional, and I really didn’t want to be out $74 if I did get sick. The race ended up selling out, but I had already tapered and wanted to run. 

I woke up Friday morning, and I felt like I had swallowed glass, and by Friday night I was thoroughly congested. Lovely. I know my body well, I guess. I’ve always run by the rule “if it’s neck or above illness, run, if it’s chest or below, rest” so when I woke up Saturday, I decided to go for some form of a run anyway to hopefully clear out my system. I took some Motrin, Sudafed, and a cough drop on an empty stomach, packed two gels, and drove out to White Rock Lake. I told myself I only had to run as far as I felt comfortable. 

### Race
The first mile, I was purely relying on vibes, trying to run at a fast but comfortable pace. No specific time goal given the circumstances. I was pleasantly surprised when it came in around the 10 min mark. 

I finish mile 2, take a gel, and realize that the water fountain I was counting on was not working. Really wishing I had signed up for an actual race at that point, I got a hint of a side stitch, but I was determined to push through. Negative splits, banking time against my 1:07 goal. 

By mile 3, I was starting to feel it. I was at a mental crossroads of trying to just settle for a new 5K PR or push through to my original goal. My heart rate was in the 200s but it didn’t feeeel like it was in the 200s so I decided to just send it. 

Miles 4 and 5 I was head down, just focused on my cadence. I had built a really epic playlist that was honestly half the reason I got out of bed on Saturday, and it for sure helped. Taking my second gel at mile 4 was brutal knowing I was not going to have a drop of water to wash it down with. 

Mile 6 I was so ready to be done, and my heart rate was still in the 200s. I had built up enough buffer time that I could’ve walked it in and still come under my goal, but I was not going to quit. 

When I was finished, I was over the moon to have a new PR, and ready for a nap. 

### Post-race
My celebratory breakfast was a Sonic Slush and a Taco Bell grilled cheese burrito. Truly a meal of champions. I immediately crashed after I was done eating, and when I woke up, I knew the congestion I had written off as a cold was probably something more. 

Sure enough, 4 hours after finishing my new PR 10K, I tested positive for COVID. What a major bummer, but the 200+ heart rate probably should’ve been a clue. Now I’m just left wondering how fast I could’ve gone if I was healthy! 

Regardless of the outcome, I’m grateful that I followed through on my training plan because I’m in the best shape of my life. My watch says my VO2 max is now 33.3, below average but a major improvement in a 5 month period. I’m confident in my treadmill abilities for next summer, and I’ve got a game plan to run my first marathon in 2026!

### Training
I followed a pretty haphazard training schedule. It all started out at the gym on the treadmill. 3 miles a day… but then my wife made a friend who she would talk with causing me to run longer and longer. Eventually going farther on treadmill became mind numbing so I moved outside and started upping my distances. 

I decided pretty early on that I wanted to run 26.2 miles just to say I could, but I didn’t want to do an actual race - I guess at the outset part of me thought it would be a competitive endeavor and I didn’t want to set myself up for that sort of disappointment. But after my long run hit 18 miles I decided I should just sign up for a marathon, looked around and saw that Tucson was timed about right. 

It was _then_ that I started taking training seriously - made a spreadsheet documenting how many miles I needed to run each day (and discovered I was actually running too many long runs and cut them back to bi-weekly). I think registered back in early October to give some context. 

I set a schedule. I caught Covid about 6 weeks out from race day, but was able to log my last long run the week before thanksgiving, clocking in at 24 miles. It was hard, but I knew if push came to shove I could probably grit out 2.2 more miles. 

My 3 week taper sucked. I mean, sitting on my ass was nice but my small runs were _really_ hard to get through mentally. 3 milers felt like forever. 6 was a slog. The one 13.1 I did (my last “long” run) got cut short at 8 miles when I got caught in a microburst and got my feet wet. I felt lazy, but yeah mostly just doing the workouts during the taper was the hardest part. 

### Pre-race
My biggest concern for the race was the pre-race. I live in Arizona, and the vast majority of my runs are done at night in +90F. I am unquestionably not a morning person, and I do not enjoy working out in the cold. 

Still I was able to put myself to bed at 9:00 the night before and wake up pretty well rested at 4:30 on race day. Downed a bagel, cream cheese and quite a bit of the dark chocolate that my in laws had sitting in their kitchen. Wife gave me a ride to the busses and I got on one of the first ones. 

The bus was pitch black, but I got to talk to a guy who had done quite a few races before. Nerves really hit me on the bus. Even though I was hyped it wasn’t until that moment that I was actually nervous about the run. Turned out the guy I was on the bus with I actually went to high school with. Also, the moon was a pretty awesome sliver as it came over the Catalinas. 

Sat on the bus for a long time. I didn’t want to brave the cold. It was 35 and windy in Oracle. I wound up disembarking with 15 minutes until the start. Found a generator to stand by to keep my legs warm for a bit and then made my way to the start. The energy around the start line was absolutely awesome. I hadn’t expected that, but there was music blasting over the loudspeakers and everyone was pretty pumped. I positioned myself just in front of the 4:20 pacer. I had a pretty good idea that I would be able to hang with him for at least most of the way — I usually Peter out around mile 20. After that it would have to be all grit to hit my target time. 


### Race
I started out waaaay too fast. I had even told myself I would hold myself back - but the beginning of the Tucson marathon is _so downhill_ that I figured I would fatigue myself more if I fought against gravity, so I just cruised. 

I was way ahead of my pace by the time I took my first gel in mile 5. About then the downhill became much more manageable and I was able to back off and settle in to a 9:30ish pace - which I knew I could hold until at least mile 20. 

The biosphere out-and-back started at about mile 9 and it was brutal. I hadn’t seen anyone walk until then, but they certainly started then - and that’s when the mental game really started for me. It’s hard to keep going when I see people resting around me. 

Still I kept it up until about mile 19 when I felt fatigue really begin to settle in. I turned off my music and reasoned that I would make it to 20 before I walked. 

Running without music is not something I typically do, but around 20 I was starting to see more people hold signs and gather around the race. So I just enjoyed that. 

Had my little break at 20, and tragedy struck - i bumped my watch wrong which “ended my workout”. That was frustrating. Took my extended break and got back to running. It was around my break that the 4:20 pacer passed me for the first time. My goal was 4:30 but I wanted to stick with him for as long as possible. Caught up to him around the time I hit my cheering section. 

My wife, kids (9, 3), brother and sister-in-law and father in law were all holding signs and ringing bells at me around 22. I knew that was where they would be but didn’t expect how much of a boost it would give me. Kept me going at least until 23 where I had to take another 1-2minute break. Pacer passed me again and I decided to catch him. 

As I approached the turn off of Oracle road, my wife and daughter came running towards me. Another good boost - they had forgotten to take pictures. It was pretty funny trying to pose as they tried to keep up. 

Caught the pacer again right at the turn, and rounded behind the Bashas to the sound of Taiko drums. Turns out they were positioned right at the most brutal hill of the race. Had to walk that hill. Seems like most people did. Not my pacer though - seemed like he turned on the afterburners. I resolved that I wouldn’t see him again. 

The last two miles was brutal. One girl was nice enough to encourage me on that we were almost there and that got me to the finish line. 

### Post-race
Due to my watch issues I didn’t know my time until my brother texted me. Super satisfied with it. 

Not much to say post race - got some BK tacos and drove back to Phoenix. My quads are destroyed today. 

Gonna take a week or so off and then assess if I want to do the lost Dutchman in march.

1585,1702327076.0,What do you do when one of your Quality Day workouts gets ruined part-way through? Reschedule the workout or let it go?,"TLDR: workout ruined halfway by unforeseen circumstances, should I reschedule for another day this week to do another half-workout or the full workout, or just let it go until next week's workout?

Today I had a threshold run scheduled, 4 mi at threshold pace (sandwiched by warm up and cool down time). About halfway into the T block, I hit a bridge that was completely iced over. I couldn't turn around because I didn't have time to go back the way I came, so I carefully walked over the bridge. This took probably more time than turning around would have because it took me 10 minutes to walk over the bridge. The ground after the bridge was glossy so I ran easy/careful to get home. I only completed 2 of my 4 threshold miles. Is it worth doing 2 more T miles in a couple days or is it important all 4 T miles are consecutive? What should I do? I'm training for a marathon.

1586,1702327008.0,Seams vs thick thighs,"Hello!!

1587,1702303332.0,Is the amount of time exercising more important than heart rate?,"Hello, so I’m beginning to get into fitness as I want to live a healthier lifestyle and lose weight. I’m 24 years old, 6’1, 257 lbs. I’ve had asthma all my life which made it hard for me to run and do other intense activities. But semi recently I was prescribed an inhaler. And I’ve noticed it actually helps me out a lot. Back when I tried running before, I’d get out of breath in no time, no matter how fast I was running, but now with my inhaler I can go about half a mile at a running pace I can keep before I have to slow to a brisk walk for a bit and catch my breath. So throughout the mile it turns into a mixture of running, walking, running walking. And my current time for getting done with the mile is about 13 minutes. 

My main question is: even though I’m only out for 13 minutes, is that a good enough amount for a day’s exercise considering my heart rate was up the whole time? Or is it more important to push myself to at least 30 minutes of constant activity, even if I’m not able to run as much in that 30 minutes? 

Of course I’m a beginner so I know overtime my body will adapt to running further before getting out of breath.",running

1590,1702223141.0,Nike air zoom rival fly 3 as daily trainers--feel great,"After a few of my go-to models were discontinued or updated in ways I did not like I tried the Nike air zoom rival fly 3 and am loving them as a daily trainer. They have that old-school racing flat feel but enough cushion for daily wear.

Relatively low stack height, light, responsive, great taction, and quite durable. I am now wearing them for most of my runs under 12 miles. It also helps that they come in at $95 at full price--but I just picked up a few pairs at $46 this morning with the various discounts Nike had going!

They market them as a race shoe but I think this is misleading. These are more like what a distance race shoe was 10+ years ago and today work as an excellent daily trainer...but for race day I would be opting for a lighter actual flat or a plated super shoe, depending on race distance.

Just sharing because I know it can be frustrating to find a good daily trainer when all the companies are updating models so frequently...and if you're putting 50+ miles a week in then the costs of some of these newer models really starts to add up!

### Training

I had just finished a 50km trail event in Jeju in October ([race report here](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/173qepm/transjeju_jeju50k_what_a_different_beast_trail/)) so I felt like I could wing this event - how wrong I was! Although I was doing 50 - 70km in weekly mileage for the weeks leading up to this, I skimped on my long runs, with no run being longer than 16km in the last 2 months. To be frank, it always seemed like 2-hour runs took a lot out of my day, so I foolishly thought that I would just make up for that by running more weekly mileage. I think this came to bite me back, as you'll see shortly.

With the race course having about 2400m of mountainous ascent and descent, you'd think I'd at least put in some trail running or hill training. Nope! I definitely should have though.

One thing that I did differently from the previous race in October was to go for physiotherapy sessions, which notably improved my single-legged stability. While rocky descents troubled me before, this time, it was my fatigued quads that posed a challenge.

### Pre-race

In my opinion, the race wasn't very well planned even though the eventual race turned out pretty well. For starters, there was a black rainstorm that happened in Hong Kong in September, causing some parts of the trail to be unrunnable. The final GPX file was only provided to us 2 days before the actual race, with a few route changes.

Race pack collection dates were also not announced until a few weeks before the event. By then, I had already booked my flights and I panicked for a moment as my flight timings were just a little too late to make it for the stated pickup times. Thankfully, they did support a race day pickup, which I only found out by sending a WhatsApp message to the organizer.

Updates primarily circulated through their social channels, adding uncertainty.

### Race Day

Race day! I woke up at a groggy 4.50 am and headed to the nearest 7-11 to grab a quick breakfast. I paid for my black coffee and cold onigiri before realizing that there was no microwave available to heat up my food. I was quite disappointed, but I decided that I would just stomach what I could and get something at the race site. I ended up getting a nice chocolate Vitasoy packet from the vending machine, which tasted amazing.

After collecting my race bib and dropping my bag off, I chilled around for a bit, [enjoying the sight of the seas as the sun rose](https://imgur.com/a/xLnsjEc).

And then we were off!

Right off the bat, we were greeted with the course's largest climb effort - a 500m ascent over the first 5 kilometers. As I've learned from my previous race, a deceptive 10% average gradient on the trails probably required 1.5x or 2x the effort of the same gradient on the treadmill. That being said, it was still the start of the race and spirits were generally high. With the number of people going on the same narrow paths, it was inevitable that some of these climbs became nothing more than a mere walk. I tried to pass some people here by speeding up and I thought that it was more than sustainable.

What goes up must come down - the next 5 km or so were the exact opposite of the first 5. Steep rocky descents that I've learned could be much harder on the quads than the ascents. Thankfully, the trails weren't as murderous as I had expected, so I had some fun flying down some of these rocky descents. I found the descents to be much less taxing on my legs than before, so I firmly believed that perhaps I could finish the race within 8 hours. After all, the course elevation profile didn't seem too bad!

Arriving at the first checkpoint (CP7), I tripped at the aid station and nearly caused a bunch of rice balls to go to waste. I got an earful from one of the volunteers stationed there (Hongkongers aren't known for their hospitality!) but I deserved it. After a quick refill of the bottles with some of their mystery sports drink and a handful of orange slices, I took off.

I have to say, the mystery sports drink that they had at all the aid stations was probably one of the worst sports drinks I have ever had in a while. But beggars can't be choosers. And amongst the gnarly flavor was a nice sweet tang that I hoped replenished my electrolytes.

The second section was relatively flat, crossing some road sections and a few small establishments. I chugged along and all seemed well. I was around the 23km mark at 4h, and I thought to myself that now that the biggest climbs are over, I had a real chance to finish below 8 hours if I pushed just a little harder.

And then the third section came around. I stuffed down quite a few bananas and even more orange slices at the second checkpoint (CP8), wary that my gel supply was getting low. This was when the fatigue started to hit. My left quad was shot with all the descents that were happening, and my calves were exhausted by the incessant climbs. Each climb had me looking at my Garmin's current climb data screen, and each descent had me carefully lowering myself so as not to load my left quad too much.

I had loaded the course GPX file onto my Garmin, and after a somewhat manageable climb my watch was telling me that there was only one hard climb left, which was about 4km away. That turned out to be a lie, as after every few hundred meters I would see myself facing yet another steep climb. This happened a few times, and by the time I reached the advertised climb on my watch, I had done about another 300m or so in climbs in between.

By the time I reached the last checkpoint (CP9) I was exhausted. I flirted with the thought of giving up, the idea of being able to rest my legs becoming more tantalizing with each passing moment. I sat down at one of the chairs, drinking a few cups of Coke and mystery sports drink that was available there. There was just about 9km left with a mere 300m in climbs, and I was certain this would be technically the easiest part of the course. But still, it was tough to get myself started again. A volunteer egged me on, telling me that I could do it.

Even though the last 9km was technically the easiest part of the course, it was the toughest for me. Whenever a flat section appeared, I would try to run about 10-20 steps, before slowing to a walk because my muscles just couldn't take it. I saw many people overtake me, most of them still having the agility to descend downwards quickly. But I didn't care about the timing anymore - I just wanted to finish.

A grueling 2 hours later, I arrived at the finish line. There was nary a fanfare, just a mandatory gear check (funny it was done at the end of the course and not before the start) before I got my medal, backpack, and headed back to my accommodation. I had finished it!


### Post-race

Reaching back into my barely 8m^2 hostel space, I took a shower and headed down to get a McCrispy from McDonald's. That was a pretty good meal.

And that wraps up my last race for the year! It was hard, but this was what I came for. Looking forward to joining more trail races in the future!

### Training
23F. I have been running for just over a year, about 20-30 MPW, and I am currently in the middle of a training block for the Austin Marathon in February. Running this race fit neatly into my training plan, so I did it. This was my first official half marathon race, and it is called the Decker Challenge because it is rolling hills the entire way. 

To prep for this race, I tried to incorporate hills every so often, once every two weeks or so. I think what really prepared me adequately was that over Thanksgiving, I visited my family who lives at a much higher elevation than Austin and ran hills daily there.

I wasn’t originally planning on really racing today, as last week’s long run was a literal soul crushing 16 miles and my hardest run yet, but it happened naturally. Incredibly proud of my result today. 

### Pre-race
The race started at 8:00 AM, so I got up at 5:30. Got dressed, ate a blueberry bagel, and chugged a nuun mix and prepped a zipfizz for closer to the race. No BM, but I don’t usually before a long run. I was really nervous as it was my first race, and I was coming off of a truly terrible training week. Last week’s 16 miler was the worst run, long or short, that I had ever done, and I had a similarly terrible 8 miler on Friday. I tried not to psych myself out, though. I told myself that I wanted to have fun, and to not run so hard that I wouldn’t enjoy it. 

I packed my 1.5 L hydration vest, 4 fruit bars (60 cal 17g of carbs, ended up using 3), and 2 gels. 

I got to the race right before 7:00 AM, and sat in my car for a bit. Drank my zip fizz, met up with a friend also racing, and headed to the start line. 

### Race
I honestly don’t know what happened here, my previous PR of the half distance, though a “training run” (I am realizing that I am taking some training runs too fast) was 2:13:37, so an avg of about 10:13. I optimistically wanted to pace this race around there, but didn’t know how feasible it would be due to the hills. Funnily enough, the first three miles I thought I was going to go out too fast. 

The first 2 miles I was really cruising, not super scary hard hills, just getting into the groove of it. At mile 2.5 I had my first fruit bar, and started enjoying myself. 

I took my first gel around mile 4.5, and by this point I had really picked up the pace. I had never before actually tried to SUSTAIN a sub 10 minute mile, and I could see I was on pace to complete another. I tried not to think about it too hard. The hills were tough, but by this point nothing too bad. 

Mile 5.5 is where the steep hills really began. I turned a corner and there it was.. the first REAL hill. I’m taking it like a freaking champ. There’s the first hill, it descends a little bit, and then goes up steeper. I called my friend between the hills behind me to warn her, LOL. A woman nearby me heard me on the phone, and started chatting with me about how this was her 3rd time racing it, and the man she was with had raced it now 17 times! They wished me luck and I was on my way. 

I took my next fruit bar around mile 6.25, and I honestly don’t remember much of 7-9. Rolling hills the whole way, but I was really cruising, not uncomfortable with pace at all. HR was higher than I would have liked (171 avg), but considering I had never paced this fast before for this long, I, again, tried not to overthink it. Mile 9.25 I took my second gel, and commenced up the biggest hill of the course. 

At the beginning of the race I had started my watch too early (and was trying not to pay too close of attention), so I wasn’t entirely sure where I was at time-wise. When I was about a quarter of the way up the hill right before mile 10, I realized I was right behind the 2:10 pacer. This whole time I had thought for some reason I was behind the 2:15 pacer, so I was absolutely elated. I actually passed him on the hill! I think the craziest part to me was that, up until this point, I was taking the hills in such stride, I couldn’t believe how.. not easy, but how manageable they were. Calves never burned, no pain, really took them like a champ. 

Mile 11… This was where I started getting impatient and it became tough. By this point my lower back was hurting a LOT, but kept repeating to myself that I only had about 20 minutes in the race left and I can do anything for 20 minutes. LOL. I took my last fruit bar, and did my best. 

When I crossed the finish line, the timer said 2:07:15 and I was absolutely shocked. I checked my official time, and there it was! 2:06:34. I cannot believe it. Overall the ascent was 738 feet, or 77 floors according to my garmin. I know it is not super speedy for many of you, but I am so incredibly proud, and had no idea i was capable of this! 

### Post-race
As soon as I finished, I ran back into the expo and sat down as fast as I could. My back was killing me, so I did some stretches and relaxed until my friend finished. Not too stiff the rest of the day, just pretty tired. 

This race has really opened my eyes for the actual marathon in February. I thought a 4:30 goal would be too ambitious, but now I am thinking that it might not be. It’s really cool and rewarding to see the training pay off like this. I am really happy and proud! 

Ahead of the marathon, I am running another half race here in Austin in January that is famous for being downhill. If I could race  like that on hills, maybe I could go under 2:05 or 2:00 super optimistically. Really excited to find out!

Average Heart Rate: 171 bpm (age is mid-twenties)

Also to anyone concerned about my heart rate, it has always been very elevated for any sports since highschool. I know it's not good to be in Zone 5, but I am aware of the worrisome cardiac symptoms, and have been since I talked to a Doctor about this in highschool. I have never experienced any, I have no idea why I run so high, while feeling fine at those heart rates.

# Training

This is my first marathon ever! I randomly woke up January 2023 and I said, ""You know what I am running a marathon."" I googled some marathon training schedules, people recommended Hal Higdon Novice Training Program 1, and I sort of followed it. I skipped a few long runs (16, 12, and 14), and I stopped for an entire week in October, as my one of my parents passed earlier in the year, and this was their funeral. I'll keep training post short, but my background is light commuting to work on a bike, lots of hiking over the years. I also learned I have an iron stomach? I discovered Gu's during training, and I will never forget the boost it gave me, used them every 30 minutes since without any symptoms. Trained around a park for my long runs, roughly exactly 3.8 miles loop, used my car as a pseudo-aid station, and took notes after each run. Notes I took: Lotion feet/toes night prior, and morning prior to run. First 3 miles I am usually in a pissy mood, but then my mentality shifted, and I would be so happy to be running outside. Pacing is crucial and training to slow my roll early paid off. I always trained negative splits and at the end of each run I would sprint and say ""There is the finish line."" For my skipped training, I am very happy that I made it sub-4 hours BARELY. I didn't really care much for it, but when I finished my 20-miler, my guy at my running shop said you can probably run a sub-4 at the paces I was training at. So I added as a cool goal to have.

# Pre-Race

Week prior. I tapered, but skipped Hal's last week prior taper and did the one earlier, so I ran 5, 8, and 4 as I was feeling good body wise, and I figured why not. I began carb-loading on tuesday. I bought most from Trader Joes, and Tues, Weds, Thurs, mildly increased carbs, probably to 350 maybe 400g per day. Friday and Saturday, both probably 500 grams each, lots of gatorade, simple carbohydrates (lots of Naan bread), bananas, fruit smoothies, straight honey, just any sugar, of course some protein and fats too. I studied the elevation map (lots of rolling hills), and I know mile marker 12-14, and mainly 24 had sharp hills. My BIGGEST issue was not diet, not training, it was my headspace. I was second guessing myself, nervous, asking why am I doing this, but I realized the biggest detriment right now is my headspace, so I made up a mantra of, ""I ran 20, I can run 26,"" and I kept repeating it and let my mind wonder elsewhere.

Morning of was a little funny. Bus driver said ""Does anyone know where we are going,"" whole bus laughs like it's a joke, no turns out she actually had no idea, and the whole tone changed when people saw a runner giving her GPS directions haha. As for me, I was nauseas, I ate a breakfast at around 5:00am was half banana, little coffee (mainly for laxative purposes), and a Spring Energy gel. I told myself that I ate this before a long run before, and my nausea is likely not food related, but more so headspace, anticipation, whatever it may be. It was 28F wind chill outside the bus, probably 20 mph winds at the top (\~2500 elevation decrease whole coarse). Never have I been happier to be in a port-a-potty for 5 minutes. Get out, go to start, race starts, and I am in the zone.

# Race

I was really confused as the pacer I was hoping to follow 4:05:00 just booked it, and everyone followed. I trained by starting off slow, I realized my happy space was 9:20-9:30 pace at the beginning of my long runs. I thought my watch was broken because everyone was passing me, and I was like what the heck, everyone is booking it out right now. But I just stuck to how I trained as that is the most important rule I learned from training. Nothing new on race day. Those pace setters, I was like they're crazy for sprinting it out, and I said I am fine running a longer marathon I guess. Miles 1-5 were fine, sun rose, wind was pushing us forward (thank god not a headwind!!), and I love running in cold, I run so hot, and it felt so good. Meet a marathon couple who I was not passing, and I said what are you guys hoping to finish at, and they said 4:05:00, and that is when I understood the mistake that so many people make when booking it out the beginning, I felt like we were on a good pace for a 4:05:00, yet those pacers were way out there, maybe positive-splits? Idk. The couple, they both ran about 6 marathons, and just said this is their happy pace, and it was mine too. We ran from miles 5-14, and held an entire conversation throughout. I remembered reading, if you can hold a conversation, then that is a good pace. It was lovely getting to know them, and it just made the race go by so quickly. After mile marker 14, I realized my body wants to naturally speed up, and I was past the halfway point, all the major rolling hills done, and I felt solid. Gu every 30-40 minutes since mile marker 4, legs felt fine, form was solid, and I just enjoyed my surroundings and took in the nature. Mile marker 18 is where things changed as two of my friends (aka the most HYPE BEASTS I know now), they were by an aid station, which was being managed by roughly 20 high school students. There is a video my friend took of him yelling ""He's coming, he's coming, "" (his nickname is Paul Revere now), and he told all these kids my name. I heard a ROAR of my name, and I just had a light switch turn on, where I realized ""Man, I feel good, my legs are fine, form is good,"" and that roar SENT me into a new mental space, and I downed two heavily caffeinated Gu's (I did this twice in two earlier long runs, stomach felt fine, so I knew I was fine), and I said ""Fuck it, it's only 8 left."" I also hugged my best friend who was videoing, said I love you, and Ill see you on the otherside. I had the longest smile during these last few miles, and seriously my friends sent me into a mental space I have never been in. I had to stop smiling because my face started feeling sore. I kept a close eye on my heart rate (It has always run high during exercise), but I was still able to hold a light conversation, I had no pain, legs felt somewhat fatigued, but they also FELT HUNGRY FOR SPEED. And I just let them do their thing. I knew the notorious hill was coming up (mile marker 24), so I slowed a little down before, but I caught up to those 4:05:00 pacers right before it. And I said I am just gunna stick with you guys because you're my goal. Well they said actually they need to stop because they are way ahead of schedule, and they gunna rest for 5 minutes, and I just asked ""You think I can run a sub-4?"" They looked at their watch, and said ""Go for it."" So off I went up that hill, they had an entire live tribal drum band which I began hearing in the distance, and that was just so freaking cool, I completely ignored the hill, felt like I was going to war! Then I just realized okay, take your time and take it easy for these next two as it's downhill. I found someone pacing at my comfortable pace, but right at the end (and the only reason why I think I shaved off 9 seconds), I see all my friends (about 9 of them) all yelling, and I cannot describe what a surreal shock of adrenaline I felt, where everything got quiet, and I sprinted what felt like an olympian at the end. I crossed, saw it was 4:00:49, and said who cares, my friends and family are here and that's all I want to see. After laying on the ground for about 15 minutes, my friend goes up to me, and said official time 3:59:51. This was all after the hugging, cheering, and just being so thankful to be around and have these people in my life. Hearing this, I just kept saying ""Wow, I did that."" Over and over again. It was the cherry on top, but I just was surrounded by so many people I loved and kept telling them thank you for being here.

# Post-Race

I actually was surprised how good I felt. Compared to the end of my 20-miler training race, I was nauseous, I cried a lot (happy tears), and my legs were on fire. This one, I laid for about 30 minutes talking with my friends and telling them how much I loved them for being here, and just stretching them out, but I started feeling good, got up, and said ""Let's go get a beer."" Didn't drink any alcohol when I started training, and I was waiting sooooooo long to have this marathon beer. As the endorphins wore off, mild ITP pain, suprisingly my right bicep feels pretty sore (I did hold a watercup and Gu for 2 miles, because I didn't want to litter), so maybe that was it? Besides that, for my first marathon, and for beginning an incredibly difficult academic program this school year, training for a marathon, and for having to go through one of the most difficult deaths of my life, I did it, and I cannot describe how proud, thankful for the loved ones in my life. I seriously conteplated cancelling the marathon when my Father passed away. But if there was one thing he taught me it, it was to turn negative moments in life into positives. He loved going on adventures too. I said running a marathon is a first time adventure to me, so I dedicated this marathon to him. He was with me throughout the race (and throughout all of my training), and I know he would be proud. He taught me to appreciate my surroundings and life in general, so on my long runs, I would look around me, and appreciate how beautiful these trees or plants look, or how lucky I am to have the health to do something like this in general. I wasn't expecting training to be cathartic, but it really was, mainly because I think it lead to me finding a way to remembering all the little things my Dad taught me growing up. All I can really say is this has been some of the most emotionally difficult months of my life, and continue to be, but I did it, this marathon is dedicated to you Pop, love and miss you everyday.

1600,1702244144.0,Things To Know Before You Sign Up For The Kiawah Island Marathon,"Hi friends, you may remember me from my last race post, [Don't Do The Charlotte Marathon](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/qwyv2v/dont_do_the_charlotte_marathon/). I'm back, and while I'm not going to tell you not to do the Kiawah Marathon, I thought it might be helpful to give some info to future potential runners about what is a fairly unusual race.

(For context, I'm a decent runner (marathons in the 3:20s and 3:30s), have done races all over the US and in Canada at a few distances from 10K to the marathon. I live in the southeast and have been trying, without a ton of success, to find a great race within driving distance (I've heard great things about Richmond so that's top of the list, the weekend just didn't work this year)).

&#x200B;

**THE GOOD:**

\-There are a lot of aspects about the race that are really well done. The expo was great, the pre-race communication was great, the bibs/medals/t-shirts also all great.

\-Aid stations and volunteers were amazing. So many aid stations, very well stocked, and the volunteers were legitimately fantastic. Huge plus from me, and a big thanks as always to volunteers.

\-Incredibly nice people everywhere. I made friends with multiple other runners along the course (which is not usually my thing at all).

\-Kiawah is beautiful and the course is very scenic. The course is also completely flat after two small hills at the start (although unsure if that's actually a good thing...see more below). My Garmin said 60 total feet of elevation, and I'd estimate that 90% of that was from those two hills.

\-The party area at the finish line was also great. Tons of food and drinks, great vibes, definitely a highlight of the experience.

&#x200B;

**THE BAD:**

I'll mostly focus on one thing here: the pre-race logistics were preposterously terrible.

\-The process for getting to the start line was comical. I signed up for this race thinking that this would be a sort of simple, laidback, small town type of race. Turns out that was very incorrect! For those who aren't local and/or don't really know (like I didn't), Kiawah is a fully private island. Like there is one road in and it has a staffed gate to allow people (aka residents) onto the island.

\-So, the race's plan was to have EVERYONE (runners + spectators) who isn't staying on the island (literally thousands of people) drive on a single backcountry two-lane road at the same time and then park in a huge field, and then get on shuttles to actually get onto the island. This resulted in a 5ish mile traffic backup with absolute chaos: drivers driving (very unsafely) on the wrong side of the road, runners running for miles along the side of the road to beat traffic to get to the shuttles--or even some ran all the way onto the island to the starting area.

\-We left for what should've been a 20 minute drive at 630am (90 minutes before the race start), and it took nearly the full hour and a half just to get to the shuttles. I was anticipating a bit of traffic, maybe 5, 10, even 15 minutes, but we sat in over an hour of backup.

\-Then once you get to the shuttles, you've got a line of hundreds and hundreds of people--and again, many of these people are spectators! So they're taking up spots and pushing actual runners out of getting to the start line on time. I ended up getting in line at about 745, and there were a ton of runners still arriving and filing in behind me.

\-Everyone in line/on shuttles was talking about how insane it was, and folks who'd done the race before said that it had never been like this. So maybe the race has gotten a lot more popular and the race organizers just weren't prepared for it? But if any of the race organizers somehow read this: please have more clear communication about these logistics, or, even better, have staggered start times, half and full on different days, or have a system in place to get the runners onto shuttles before spectators.

\-Speaking of staggered starts: with the half and full start together, super cramped in a very narrow start line corral, and the first 2ish miles are super congested (again, something you'd expect at a big city major race but not here!)

\-The race also felt understaffed. I genuinely don't think I saw a single race employee at any point--not at the shuttle (which would've been very useful!), not at the starting area, and nowhere along the course (which is especially egregious given that a bunch of turns were pretty confusing...it seemed like spectators were often just pointing out where to go, or maybe those were some race staff who didn't have any official ""race employee"" type apparel on?)

&#x200B;

**OTHER UNUSUAL THINGS TO KNOW:**

\-The course is amazing in the sense that you're running on beautiful streets lined with beautiful homes and a golf course. The downside is that most of the race is very quiet, with very few spectators. This race really made me appreciate how much I rely on spectators and the energy of the course to keep me going.

\-In addition, the one aspect where my previously stated expectations about a laidback atmosphere certainly did play out was along the course, especially in the last 6-7 miles. There were a ton of sections where you were running literally next to/alongside cars with no dividing cones or anything, other times where spectators are weaving through the race on bikes, and even times where you'd be running around/through spectators who were just sort of hanging out or walking back to the finish on the same narrow path as the race. You also rejoin the half marathon around mile 15ish (I forget exactly) and end up having to weave through a lot of walkers. This was all obviously pretty annoying (and unsafe!) and totally killed the race ""vibe"" for me.

\-The last mile or two in particular was so odd--you run on sand for part of it, literally weave through spectators and people through some type of beach club, and then you pop out of these weird back paths 100 yards from the finish line. Definitely not ideal while you're grinding out the end of the race.

\-The course is also just generally super winding with a lot of turns, and a lot of the second half of the marathon is on a narrow golf path, so just be prepared for that fairly unusual race terrain.

\-Finally, the race is completely flat after a hill in the beginning. I thought this would be a good thing, since I don't love super hilly running, but it turns out that total flatness for that distance can wreck your legs even worse if you're not prepared. My quads were an absolute mess pretty early on, and they have never given me issues. So make sure you get in a lot of flat training!

&#x200B;

Hope this is helpful if you're considering Kiawah in the future. My personal recommendation would be to do the half, not the full, and make it more of a fun run/weekend trip than a peak race where you're going for a PR, especially if you're fast.",running

Unfortunately I don't know much about running at all (I'm a cyclist) so I'm struggling to come up with Christmas gifts for them. They both enjoy reading, so I was thinking about getting them each a book. What would be some good books about running (or athletics in general, which they also enjoy), that they aren't likely to have read already? I'm thinking perhaps something that covers the history behind some aspect of the sport, an autobiography by an incredible athlete, or a book about some amazing feat in the sport as they often talk about crazy ultra endurance events people do.

I'd also be happy to hear suggestions for non-book gifts for runners. I imagine runners are just as picky about their gear as cyclists, so I imagine it is hard to pick something universal, that any runner would be happy with.

1608,1702121419.0,Menstrual cycle-tracking app recs,"(Crossposted from r/XXRunning for visibility)

Howdy! I'm a marathon-distance running data nerd who trains with a Garmin. Garmin's menstrual cycle tracking feature, bluntly, su-hucks. Its cycle tracking interface is totally cut off from other data like activities, RPE, RHR, etc., and I want more customization than it permits. While I'm loath to input/split data across multiple platforms, until Garmin hires a few menstruating data nerds to iron out (no pun intended) that feature, input/split my data across multiple platforms I will.

Any cycle-tracking app recommendations that are highly customizable? Maybe they even sync with Garmin activities? Maybe they even take privacy seriously in a post-Roe America? (Too much to ask?)\*

Thanks!

\*I used the Kindara app several years ago when I was TTC; their customization was the best I found at the time, but I deleted the app in light of their disappointing privacy policies.

\--

ETA: Thanks for weighing in, everyone! I've spent today's post long-run downtime exploring the apps recommended here and elsewhere, including the following:

* [FitrWoman](https://fitrwoman.com) \- apparently the US women's soccer team uses it, but the best it does as far as tracking activities is letting you select your ""workout intensity,"" without any customization for what that/those activities may be. (Does the US women's soccer team not cross train?) DELETE!
* [Clue](https://helloclue.com/) \- far and away the most recc'ed! I used it years ago and can see why it gets high marks — lots of cool, new features (though not the ones I'm looking for, and not customizable enough, even in the paid version, to add in my own data). It does integrate with the Oura Ring, so for people using that device, you probably get some additional insights. For those who share my concerns about privacy, its policies bode well for us. But overall, Clue doesn't meet my data inputting criteria, so this one's not for me, either.
* [Wild.AI](https://Wild.AI) \- not gonna lie, this one freaks me out a little. Its byline is ""Training with the Wild.AI App gives you accurate data about your physiology; helping improve your performance and prevent injury,"" which, yeah, sounds like a byline written by ChatGPT. On its face, it sounds like Wild.ai trying to do what I want it to do, and I did download it and put in my basic info. A quick once over shows me a lot of good information regarding hormone cycles and recommended nutrition and exercises — very Stacy Simsian — but all this information sort of belabors the point and doesn't seem to serve a function beyond basic education. I didn't research its privacy, but it feeeeels...not great and I wouldn't be shocked if it was already dispensing all my \~\*womanly data\*\~ to Senators around the country. This one might be one to watch, but for now, DELETE.

Sooo...now I'm two hours into building my own data tracking google sheet, obviously. (: Hmu if you want a copy of the template.",running

1613,1702041478.0,How would you tackle training for Hyrox - a hybrid event?,"For context: Hyrox is a ""fitness-race"" that involves 8 1km runs, with a fitness station between each kilometer. The total event consists of:

1km run

Ski Erg

1km run

Sled Push

1km run

Sled Pull

1km run

Burpee Broad Jump

1km run

Rowing

1km run

Farmers Carry

1km run

Sandbag Lunges

1km run

Wall Balls


As you can see, it's a lot of running. I've heard some people say that they expect to be able to run the 1 kilometer repeats at about half-marathon pace.

How would you tackle training for this event? I've been doing a long run, tempo run, and two easy runs per week. Is it smart to do some compromised running (running while fatigued)?

Any insights would be greatly appreciated! I know it's not exclusively a running event, but typically people run for more than 50% of their racing time, so I hope this is still the right sub for this post. Thanks in advance!",running

Training  
Started training specifically for this race around August. Kicked off the block by doing a 27km long run with some surges in the middle to see what I could handle. Built up to 70km weeks about 3-4 months in a row before starting this block. Peak weeks were around 85-95km. The longest run was about 34km 4 weeks before then got the flu hard which put me out from normal training for 5 days. I felt the most prepared during this block than my previous ones. 

Weekly trainings looked like: 

Monday - OFF

Tuesday - 10km recovery run + 5 hill sprints

Wednesday - AM Tempo / threshold session (11-16k of work), PM 4-5km jog 

Thursday - 45-60m spin bike + 10-15 strength training session. 

Friday - 15km progressive. (started at 6:15/km down to 5:00 ish/km)

Saturday - Easy run (6:00/km) with short tempo/ intervals (8-11km of work)

Sunday - 22km-34km long run. Did marathon pace intervals every 2-3 weeks, which included anywhere from 10km-15km at Marathon pace. Running them progressive was always the goal.

  
Pre-race  
Woke up at 5am, drank LMNT 500ml, + some toast with peanut butter and banana. I usually never eat this much before long runs but I decided since I had about 4 hours before start time I would be fine to eat a bit and avoid stomach cramps. Drank maurten 320 500ml up until the start time. 

Warmed up for about 15 mins an hour before start. Did a few strides and drills around 10 minutes before the start to be fired up. 

  
Race  
This marathon course went through of my daily training routes so I was very familiar with all the elevation changes and sights. A lot of people I knew came out to see me (including the students I teach) and called my name so that was really fun and made me feel like a superhero when I high-fived a whole row of kids. 

I took Maurten 100 at 15km & 25km(CAF) Maurten 160 at 7km & 30km and a coworker brought me a 250ml bottle of Maurten 320 at 10km + 30km. Tried to aim for 210g of carbs but I couldn't take anything after 30km however, so I dumped the bottle. 

Felt stomach cramps immediately at 2km up until 10km. Then felt fine and strong all up until 25km when I had to stop and use the toilet for a bit. From then on, my pace started slowing down and I started to feel the tiredness on my legs. I kept pushing as the crowds got thinner. Then around 39km the final point of the race was mostly uphill onto a highway then a bridge. I walked a little bit until a race volunteer screamed my name and kept saying ""3 more to go!!! LET'S GOOOOOO!"" His energy honestly kept me going, I was so ready to quit. I finished just holding on by a string and felt like my legs couldn't work anymore. First time I have felt any sort of cramping during a marathon as well.   
Post-race  
Had a banana and miso soup right after, but I couldn't stomach the idea of any more food. At around dinner time I was able to eat normal food and celebrated with my family. Took 2 weeks off from running and caught up with stuff I neglected while marathon training. Now on week 3 easy and getting back just doing easy jogs. Training for the next challenge starts next week!

**Training** As I have stated in a previous race report, I am a late to life (51M) runner (although I ran 800 in middle school and CC in high school last century in the 1980s) I started running (again) in Sept after my MD said I needed to lose some weight. Part of the weight gain was due to quitting smoking just over a year ago (475 days ago on Dec 2nd). After logging some miles in September, I decided I needed a goal and set out to run this race. Googled half marathon training for beginners and found a basic plan that really just focused on miles and going from a run 5 minute/walk 3 minute to a run 10 minute/walk 1 minute split. During the course of my training I also ran 2 10k races (Wicked 10k in Va beach at 1:18:xx and the Palmetto Peach in Augusta at 1:06:xx.) the second of which was the Saturday before. Also during training, my wife (who doesn't run but loves to shop) did research and bought me shoes. First it was NB Rebel v3's and then Hoka Mach x. I wanted to break in the Mach x, so two of my last three runs were in those and I set a PB 10k the Wednesday before at 1:02:xx. I was stoked and set my assumption that I could hit 2:15 based on that. Little did I know that training with no hills would catch up with me in a bad way. Also, a half is a different beast than 10k.

**Pre-race** This was good. Drove in the night before and spent the night at my Aunt's. Her partner runs and told me that the Neuse River Trail was mostly flat (lies). Woke up morning of, had my bagel and PB with a cup of coffee. On the way drank a celsius. Found the 2;15 group and waited for the start. The day was really warm for December, I believe it ended up being around 60F at the start of the race. It was drizzling on and off and muggy. Stretched, used the porto-potties, milled about. Ingested some Gu and waited for the start.

**Race** The race started really well for me. I knew that I wouldn't be able to sustain my last training 10k, so i made a concerted effort to shoot for a comfortable pace of 10:30. I believed I could maintain that and did pretty well for the first 6 miles. At the 5.4 timing station I was at 56:13 on time with an average of 10:25. I felt really good. Saw my wife, gave her a smile, was really feeling proud of myself. Little did I know that there was a massive climb looming. As I mentioned in training, there are no hills where I live. I am roughly an hour and change inland from Kitty Hawk. It is flat. So when I say massive hill, it's a relative term. If I had to guess, it was maybe 100feet elevation change. Probably not even that as my watch said I climbed 11 stories and the hill went up then back down to the turn around, then back up and back down. But it felt like Everest (sp?). Between mile 5.4 and 7.8 (which were the same station) I went from a 10:25 average to a 10:54 average. To cover that 2.4 miles it took me almost 28 minutes. It sucked the life out of me, and I still had miles to go. The 2:15 group I had stayed ahead of prior to the hill, passed by me right after the turn. Just before the station at 7.8, my feet were hurting, I was wondering why I was doing this, I just was having a big ol pity party in my mind. Then I saw my wife again, this time she was holding a sign that said ""On a scale of 1-10 your a 13.1"" Cheesy, but well timed. I started running for health reasons; I want to be able to spend quality years with my wife as we get older. Seeing her there motivated me to finish (and I ended up passing 4 people between 7.8 and 13.1). I didn't set any records, but I got closer to where I normally run my miles toward the end.

**Post-race** I finished. Holy cow. Super excited, super sore. The wife wanted to stop by some stores while we were in Raleigh, and getting in and out of the car was fun. Once I got moving I was fine until we got back in the car and and stiffened up as went to the next store. I did wear my medal into the first store; tacky I know, but I wanted people to know why I was walking like a 100 year old. I took it off after that, but still told people I had just run a half marathon (not to proud to seek affirmation; its my love language.) A little sore the next day, but not to bad. Monday morning I was back at it knocking out a 5k. I am starting training for the Colonial half marathon in Feb and following an actual plan this time that has long runs, intervals, easy runs and fartleks. I also have found a hill in the next town over that I plan on incorporating into my trainings. I never imagined that the half would be so much different than the 10k. For someone who until August had 3 pair of shoes (black and brown dress shoes, and a pair of tennis shoes) and a pair of crocks to now having 3 pairs of (dedicated) running shoes, another pair of running shoes that I thought were running shoes but were really just lifestyle shoes and are now just that, work tennis shoes, a pair of recovery slides, and various other accoutrement that my wife has researched and bought, I think I am getting hooked.

1622,1701984993.0,FIRST MARATHON!--St. Jude 2023,"**First marathon in the books with a 3:08 official!** 

It was a great experience, and I feel very proud/happy with my race effort. Last I posted (I think) was after my first half marathon in Nov. 2022, and if I'm being honest, the reception was certainly not overwhelmingly positive, specifically as it related to my (relatively) higher training volume having just started really running. I started running around Aug/Sept. 2022. I've put a great deal of myself into running. I've been as consistent in my training/nutrition as I possibly could, given I am also a full-time PhD student/researcher. I have some ambitious running goals, with becoming a marathoner as a first major hurdle/goal for me--and I can now call myself a marathoner. I missed Boston Qualification by 3 minutes!--however, I placed 10th in the 35-39yr category, and 55th overall out of 2317 runners. Despite missing Boston qual time and missing sub-3hr...I'm very happy with the race...I'm very much grateful I was able to do it in the time I did, regardless.

\### Training

**TLDR**: \~80+mpw for the last 6+months; 7d/wk; mostly easy zone2 runs; 2d/wk tempo or track or intervals; 1d/wk long run; every other long run typically had some hard pace thrown; 2-3x/wk weight training full-body barebones compound movements.  

My training has received a fair bit of concern and criticism--at least when I posted what my thoughts on training were in the past. However, I can only say this is what I DID...I will not say it is the best way, the most optimal way, nor the way that YOU should. My Strava is linked for this race, but all of my activities and training are totally public. To summarize: I've simply just not had a single week really below 60mpw in over a year...and the vast majority of weeks starting in say June/July 2023 up to now have been in the \~80-85mpw. One week maybe around 95mpw in there...maybe a week here or there in the 70s. Most weeks would consist of 3d/wk of ""quality"" work--one of which often a traditional sort of tempo/threshold run--one of which often a track sort of interval session--one of which a longER run. I ran 7d/wk for the last year basically outside of the very rare totally unforeseeable events precluding me from doing so. The vast majority of the mileage outside of those two harder paced (tempo and track) were Zone 2 heart rate (e.g., HR in the 140s.. RPE fairly easy). There were very few days where my daily mileage was below 10miles...very few. I did include a lot more treadmill work in the last few months than I had previously. Most of my weekly long runs were outdoors...most were at a reasonable easy effort...however, I did make a point to include harder pacing in my long runs at some point throughout every other week or couple of weeks. If I had a long run that was a distance I had not previously achieved, I would make sure that run was 100% easy paced. I didn't want to increase the distance of the long run significantly while also including intense effort. I did use the adaptive V.O2 app for a lot of my training--but, this was more so as a general guidance and template. I do hold a masters of science in exercise physiology, so I did call on my own formal background at times, AS WELL AS my perception of how I felt. If I knew I didn't sleep as well as I should have before a quality day, I may move the day over or not do it at all. There were some weeks I did almost all just easy runs.  

Addition to the running, I weight train 2-3x/week. Weight training for me were barebones full-body compound barbel movements.  Typically: Barbel Squat 5x5, Overhead press 5x5, Rows 5x5 OR deadlift 2x5. Instead of barbel squat I would sometimes sub in unilateral work like bulgarian split squats. Instead of conventional deadlift, I would rarely sub in romanian deadlifts. I always paired my weight trained AFTER a hard quality session. I tried to keep my training very much polarized, whereby hard days were hard and included the quality session + weights (AFTER)...this keeping my easy days 100% easy jog and no weight training. For me, this seemed to work. It may not work well for you. It may be better if I structure things differently in the future. 

No, I did not have any major injuries. YES, I did have niggles and pains...no doubt...and I just would do some more easy running or swap in more treadmill stuff to manage those and run through them in a SOMEWHAT safe/controlled way. I'm NOT recommending you run through pain. I'm just telling you what I did and what I do. Maybe one day I'll have something that I can't run through--it hasn't happened as of the time of writing. Taper was \~14 days and I basically followed the prescription laid out in the V.O2 app for tapering.  In terms of nutrition: I am METICULOUS and track everything. Again, this borders on disordered eating and I WOULD NOT recommend you weigh and track your food every day...I would NOT recommend you get as honed in on bodyweight/race weight as I did. I've maintained my bodyweight throughout this last year at around 137-143lbs depending on the day.  
\### Pre-race  
The two days up to race I switched my macronutrient intake to favor carbs even more heavily than usual. I was in a slight surplus for sure and took in 700-800g of carbs each of those two days. A lot of fluids too. The day of the race, I got there early, checked my bag and stood in the cold for about an hour at the corral. Met Ken Rideout at the start, which was cool. Talked a bit with fellow runners. Ate some jelly beans and such in anticipation. 

  
\### Race  
I actually was aiming for 2:59. My strategy was pace conservatively for the first half and go from there. First marathon race and I didn't want to blow up. First mile, my shoe came untied and that cost me about 20-30sec...oh well. From there, I may have been a little too conservative OR just right...as I did finish without a real massive drop off in effort. Fast mile was the 20th mile. That said, I simply did not put the gas on like I maybe COULD have or should have to make up the difference in time. First 13 miles were a breeze...it felt sustainable and reasonable up to about mile 16-17 and that's when I think mentally it started to become a bit harder. Mile 20 onward I was kind of wanting to get off the ride...not because it was unreasonably difficult, but because I was just ready to cross the line already by that point. Last 5k was pretty much the most difficult for me mentally. In retrospect, I KNOW I did have it in me to truly go all out and put every last drop of effort--but, I just didn't. If anything, I slowed slightly and kind of told myself that I was OKAY with myself to just hang on to that comfortably uncomfortable pace until the finish. I think this occured when I realized it would require significantly more pain and effort to MAYBE break 3hrs...if it was even possible at all...thus, I kind of just settled if that makes sense.  

I crossed the line feeling pretty good. If I HAD to, I could go another mile...but I would not have enjoyed it. Makes me wonder if I had it in me to do sub 3 physically, but not mentally. I'm unsure...and I don't care too much. I THOUGHT I needed <3hr for Boston--I didn't know **until after the race** that Boston qualification was 3:05 for my age...only 3min off what I did. If I knew that during the race, I think I could of possibly squeezed 3 mins of effort somewhere in those miles..coulda woulda shoulda.   
\### Post-race  
Felt a bit in the hips and after walking noticed my left big toe was fullbore turf-toe flaired up. I walked around the area a bit looking for my dad who couldn't find parking LOL. We then took some pictures, went to the post-race pizza/beer area. I didn't eat pizzaor drink a beer...I decided to drink a big water bottle and a nutrigrain bar that were given to me...and I had a cafe mocha because they were there and I like them. My father (who flew in from FL to be here) and I went out for a great pizza later that night. I ended up eating a huge bowl of greek yogurt, cottage cheese, blueberries, and rice crispies/cap'n crunch (my usual night cap to be honest). Then went to sleep. Felt pretty sore the next couple of days. 

I've since not run at all, but have go on daily leisurely walks around downtown to keep the legs moving. I think I'll get back to running tomorrow or saturday...all easy...no structured training. But, I will reverse taper for the next 2-3 weeks before I get up to any significant volume. 

I feel happy with my performance. I've only been at it a bit over a year...and so, I'm hopeful that I have some PBs over the next years, given I maintain consistency and potentially work with a coach from here on.

1624,1701958906.0,The running equivalent of Rapha 500? Introducing the Running Festive 120,"The Rapha Festive 500 is a challenge to ride (on your bike) 500 kilometres (310 miles) between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve. It’s a pretty cool challenge, as 500k is not easy for everyone during the holiday season.   
  
This year I want to do something similar – but in terms of running!   
  
So I found [an old Strava article](https://stories.strava.com/articles/how-does-your-training-stack-up-against-the-pros) from 2021, that compares pros to the average Strava user. According to Strava the average cyclist rides around 72 kilometers (45 miles) meaning that the Rapha 500 requires the average user to ride almost 7 times as much during the Christmas week, compared to the yearly average.  
  
Translating that into running numbers, the average runner runs 17,7 kilometres (11 miles) a week on average. To make a similar challenge, the goal must be around 122 kilometers (75 miles), but let’s make it 120.   
  
So that’s it. Are you ready to join the challenge or make it a yearly goal?   
Since I don’t own a brand to name the challenge after, you can name it whatever you like.

1639,1701833247.0,Stop training by heart rate (post mostly targeted to newer runners)!,"Hello everyone. I understand the title/body of the post may be controversial and elicit some strong reactions for those who currently train by heart rate or got their start in running with heart rate training, but I ask you to hear me out for your sake (and it really is only for that).

Training by heart rate has become increasingly popular over the last decade with the rise of smart watches and phone apps to track data. On the surface it seems like a good thing, right? More knowledge, more power, more advancement in the science of running. Unfortunately this is not the case and the obsession with heart rate training and other forms of data are actually becoming incredibly counterproductive, particularly for newer runners.

What are the problems with heart rate training? There are several in my view.

1. In regards to zone training in particular: running TOO slow, ALL the time. A lot of new runners believe they need to stick to zone 2 or they will 100% get injured, or 100% burn out. This is not the case. What ends up happening is that you end up running extremely slow every day and not really providing much of a training stimulus. As a beginner your heart rate is going to be extremely high when running no matter what, and even if you know your max heart rate and ""properly"" calibrate your zones, that zone 2 heart rate is going to be very low and as a result you're going to have to *crawl* to maintain it. Even for advanced runners I still think that zone 2 is very low. I understand the sentiment and know that easy mileage and high volume is important for success, but at the end of the day 60% of your max heart rate is just an arbitrary cookie cutter number that has no physiological bearing. It's also a very low number and in general is far slower than you usually need to stick to on an easy day.

If you want to run faster and get better, yes, running a lot slowly *will* improve you as a beginner, but you will improve FASTER if you incorporate some faster running/higher quality. I'm talking only 1-2 times a week, there's no need to bash your head into a wall every day. As an advanced runner, improving will *require* hard running.

2. I touched on this in #1, but to expound: ""Zones"" are pseudoscience. Your body doesn't know what % of heart rate it's running at. All it knows is effort, and heart rate is just a function of that. Reverse engineering it does not work so well. In the same way, all you, as a runner, need to know is EFFORT. The replacement for heart rate training is training by feel. As a wise man once said:

""Easy days easy, hard days hard."" If it feels easy, it's a good easy pace. If it's challenging, it is a good workout effort. That is all you need to know. Learning to *feel* these efforts is going to be an invaluable long term skill as a runner. Only you are you, and *you* ought to be the one to know how everything is feeling. The more time you spend doing this, the more fine-tuned you will be to the point where you can perfectly dole out your effort in a training week and know exactly how much you have left in the tank on a given run. That is the ultimate gold standard.

3. Over-reliance on technology and watch-staring is preventing you getting there and learning what training should *feel* like. You need to be the one regulating your effort, not staring at your 300 dollar Coros 4050 telling you what your lactate is at a heart rate of 153 BPM. Running is not that complicated. You run a lot, mostly easy, sometimes hard and specific to the race you are training for. That's it. If you're world class 800m runner or 5k runner, maybe you can be a bit more focused and add in things like lactate monitoring, but for 99.99% if people (and that includes some very good runners) the only thing you should be focused on is the actual training you do, not the nitty gritty details. You're gonna feel more tired some days than others, that's ok and expected. You have to learn to be able to understand what the good tired and bad tired is, and that can only come with trial and error of training by feel, not by staring at a watch.

4. Over-complication of what should be relatively simple training theory can lead to paralysis by over-analysis. I believe I touched on this in #3, but again, the beauty of this discipline is its simplicity. Speed and results are a function of the volume and quality of volume you put in. You hit your 30 miles this week and your tempo and long run went well? Awesome, that's great, keep plugging along. Instead what I'm seeing is people who have barely set foot out of the door asking what the ideal cadence and heart rate is, and if they gained any benefit from a run because it was 2 bpm over zone 2. No. Again, these things are *products* of the function you put in. Form and cadence will iron themselves out over time as you get fitter from running more and training harder. Heart rate will depend on how hard you are running but it is not the thing you should monitor. Paralysis by over analysis. Throw the HR monitor and Stryd in the trash, and be rid of it.

5. Heart rate is incredibly inconsistent and dependent on a multitude of factors. Didn't sleep well? You're going to have a high heart rate. Stressed out? You're going to have a higher heart rate. Taking certain medications? Going to have a lower heart rate. Sometimes, even for an indescernible reason, your resting heart rate will be off of what it usually is. Now what? If your resting heart rate is 10 BPM higher for no discernible reason, and you feel ok, is it really logical to then go out and run even slower to stick to that coveted zone 2 because your heart rate is high on this particular day? A metric that has constantly shifting goal posts is in general not a good metric and it is no different here.

6. This isn't so much a demonstration of the shortcomings of HR training, but more of a case study. Take a look at the top 10 finishers at your local marathon major. Or the top 30 in the world rankings for the 5k. Look at the names of all these men and women, and then go do some research on them. Check out their social media. What are you not going to find? Any mention of heart rate. I posit, NO, and I mean ZERO, world class runners train by heart rate, because they know what a bad and unimportant metric it is.  Everybody's hero, Eliud Kipchoge, what about him? Nope, doesn't train by heart rate. There is a phenomal channel on YouTube called Sweat Elite which goes in depth in the training of pros and has filmed many sessions with Kipchoge training with the Kenyan National Team. Guess what, no HR monitors or runners training by heart rate to be found. Just some guys bashing out repeats at a prescribed pace based on their current fitness ability, or doing some long runs at a ""steady-medium effort"". If the best in the world aren't doing it... how would it possibly benefit a new runner?  


Of course at your local park run, there are undoubtedly going to be many poor blokes that train by heart rate. Why? Lack of knowledge and also the fact that these people are likely newer runners that have started training in the last 10 years when heart rate training began to be marketed and wrongly popularized. Essentially, they have been, unbeknownst to them, caught up in what amounts to a pseudoscience fad. As time passes and the world becomes more technologized and capitalism continues to grow, we are going to see more of these tech products being sold and marketed. Just because it seems like cutting edge science or training theory does not mean that that is reality. These watch companies are making a killing off these 300 dollar smart watches with heart rate features, so of course they are going to continue to be marketed.

Of course, some people will argue that heart rate shouldn't be a crutch but just another little tool/metric you can keep an eye on to ""keep easy runs honest"" or something of that nature. I think that position is more fair; however in all honestly I still don't think I'd go as far as to make that compromise. If you understand the basics of running periodization; base phase with the higher mileage and aerobic workouts, racing phase with some race specific sessions and races, peaking phase with the peaking workouts and taper, and that you do all of these workouts at the appropriate effort/prescribed pace, you already have everything you need. I don't see why you need to add more metrics and more nitpicky little details.

Still more people may argue that since a few of their favorite YouTubers train by heart rate (Stephen Scullion or James Dunne or whoever else) train by heart rate, and that these runners are ""pretty good"" (again, I emphasize not world class) that it is a valid method, and that the echo-chamber of Youtube comments might confirm their sentiments to them. To that I say that just because someone is doing well with something does not mean it is optimal or even good - Stephen Scullion is obviously an elite runner but I argue that that is largely a result of his extreme talent, and that he could be even faster if he did not subscribe to the notion of heart rate training as no world class marathoners faster than him do.

I'm fully aware how controversial this will be and I welcome the discourse to be had.

Next day edit: the battle lines have been drawn. I won’t be responding to any more comments on here at least for a while. I have learned that PERHAPS there are situations such as mountain or trail running where heart rate can be useful. I have also learned of many differing and well-researched opinions that have come to different conclusions than me, and that these view points are not necessarily wrong. I will cede these points. Have a good day everyone",running

### Training + Background
This was my 3rd marathon, all 3 run this year. I ran Paris back in Apr and the Marine Corps Marathon on Oct. For Paris I used Hal Higdon's intermediate 1. For MCM and CIM, along with some halfs between Paris and MCM, I used Greg McMillan's run team at the premium level. It's kind of a private coach lite setup. My coach scheduled all the plans, adjusted them for my goals and spliced different ones together to cover all the races I had scheduled. We settled on something that had 5 days/wk of running, 1 cross training day and 2 strength days. When I ran Paris earlier this year I had quite a bit of hip pain in the 2nd half so the strength training was important. I did not have any hip pain during MCM or CIM, so it worked! The plan had 1 workout per week that varied depending on how close to races I was. These included hill sprints, threshold repeats, cruise intervals etc. The long runs were on Sundays and 3 days/wk of easy runs. Since MCM and CIM are only 5 weeks apart MCM was treated as an extended long run. That brought the total of 20+ mile runs to 3 for my training. The mileage overall was relatively low and my peak week was 47ish miles. Oct and Nov were 179 and 158 miles respectively.

### Pre-race
I flew to Sacramento on Friday, sat in rush hour traffic getting to my hotel. Note to self: don't book flights that arrive around rush hour! I got to the hotel to late to go to packet pickup Friday so just had dinner and relaxed. Saturday I went over to packet pickup first thing in the morning. I also used that to figure out how long it would take to walk to the busses on Sunday. I did a shakeout run with a bunch of people that was organized by Kofuzi and Rabbit at noon. I pretty much always run in the morning so it was a bit uncomfortable running right after eating lunch. Met some nice people and shook off the last of the flight fatigue. After dinner I got everything ready for the morning and tried to go to sleep early since I needed to get up at 3:45am. I'm not an early sleeper so tossed and turned until 9:30ish when I finally fell asleep.

My alarm went off at 3:45 and I almost shut it off and went back to sleep. Glad I set alarms on my phone and watch since the second one at 3:46 reminded me to get my butt out of bed. Got dressed, grabbed a bagel, my gels and water bottle then headed out for the busses. Got to the start area with a bit over an hour to kill so warmed up a bit and tried to actually wake myself up.

### Race
I had trained with a 4:22 (10 minute miles) pace planned, but decided to start a bit conservative and run the 1st half with the 4:30 pace group. Then pick up a bit after that when the course mostly flattens out. Things started out good, over the rolling hills in the first 5k basically right on plan. In spite of the hills this felt easy and relaxed enough to chat with some other people in the group. I think I was finally awake by 5k, even though I'd been up for 4 hours at that point. The stretch from 5k - 10k has more downhill so was again just easy cruising. A bit of yoyoing from the group in this stretch due to congestion at aid stations but overall ok. Downhills made it easy to catch back on when needed. Things got a bit rough from 10k - 15k. Probably a little too much water and had to make a quick stop during this stretch then catch back up with the group. Doing that just before an uphill is not recommended. I wound up pushing a bit harder than I probably should have to catch back up. By the half I had drifted a bit back from the 4:30 pacers but was still only a few, 11 to be exact, seconds off where I wanted to be.

I figured if I could pick up a second or 2 per mile I could still hit my main goal of sub 4:30. Turns out this was not to be though. Around mile 15 I started having some stomach issues but kept chugging along but at a slower pace. I also started to have some cramping between my shoulder blades that really messed with my breathing. That had me walking at times to be able to catch my breath again. I was still moving but had lost sight of the 4:30 group by 25k. Around 30k my stomach issues had caught up with me and I had to make a pit stop. I lost about 5 minutes there and not long after the 4:35 pace group caught up to me. I tried to stick with them but had to keep walking because of the cramps and general stiffness in my upper back. I yoyo'd on and off the group until I lost them going over the J st bridge around 35k. From there it was a struggle to run/walk my way to the finish. I settle to mostly a walk half a block run 3 and a half blocks rhythm until I got to the U turn just before the finish. I pushed through that last bit and was having a hard enough time breathing when I crossed the line that I came pretty close to passing out. But I did finish and, even with all the struggles, wound up with a 10+ minute PR!

### Post-race
Post race I had pretty mixed emotions. I was happy to get a PR but pretty down that I wasn't able to hit my goal of sub 4:30. I think the stomach issues were mostly due to traveling and eating out which I don't normally do a lot of. Not sure how to solve the back cramps issue. So if anyone has ideas please share!

I'm signed up for my next marathon at the Coast Guard marathon next Apr and am planning to try Hanson's this time. CGM looks pretty flat so will be shooting for sub 4:30 there again.

# Background

27M. Back when I was in my undergrads, all male students in the university were required to take an 1k test each semester in freshman and sophomore years, the passing time is 3 minutes and 50 seconds if I remember correctly. Of course I failed the first three semesters. I had no idea how to improve at that time. But I decided to run more and I learned from somewhere that you can develop a habit by repeating it 21 days. I forced myself running a 5k for 21 days consecutively no matter what. I still remember how hurt it was the first week. I could barely walk but I insisted. Good news was that I passed the last 1k test in my sophomore years. Running itself was not enjoyable at all since I just pushed very hard each time. But forcing myself running very hard made me set a 5k PB of 22:15 in 2015. Then I stopped running for years.

When the pandemic came, I decided to pick up running again. However, I could barely run a 3k without hurting my knees. I went to the PT and the doctor suggested me to start slowly and decrease the intensity. The intensity means speed, distance, and terrain. I didn't understand it fully tbh. I thought my knee was broken because I was able to run a 22:15 5k in 2015 but my knees hurt so much even if I just ran 2 mile with 11\~12 minutes per mile pace.

# Training

I started taking running seriously in May, 2023. I found a video by a Dutch YouTuber named Floris Gierman at that time. In the video, this guy talked about low heart rate training method while running a sub3 marathon. I was amazed and decided to gave it a try, which completely changed my understanding of running.

Low heart training, Zone 2 training, MAF training, 80/20 training, however you want to call it. The core idea is to run it slowly most of the time. My gf bought me an Apple watch as a reward for swimming 100 yards continuously. (Yes, I learned how to swim in March, 2023.) So I could track my heart rate while running. I was aiming to run a half marathon at the end of August, but I learned it usually took 3 months to build the aerobic base. So I was thinking why not just be patient and run the half marathon until December here in State College, I don't even have to travel. Below are some snapshots of my training in the beginning.

|Date|Pace|HR|
|:-|:-|:-|
|May 9|10:58|168|
|May 25|12:37|147|
|June 13|11:18|145|
|August 30|9:31|151|

I ran about 250 miles (all easy miles) between June and August. My Zone 2 pace drop from around 12:30 to around 9:30. Most importantly, my knees felt wonderful and running becomes much more enjoyable.

Starting from the beginning of September, I decided to add some speed work and used a 12-week HM plan from runner's world website. I finished most of the training except one week I travelled to Phoenix in mid October. I ran with downtown phoenix running club in the Monday evening while I was there. That running club was amazing. People were super friendly and the organization was incredible.

Other than that, I ran about 5 days a week and peaked at 40 miles a week. My longest run was a 16 miler two weeks before the race. I had my best HM distance time trial of 1:53 on a very flat course at the end of October.I ran the race course in the Sunday of Week 9 and just realized how hilly it is. It has a total elevation gain of 860 feet, which is more than the so-called hilly course of NYC full marathon! I almost wanted to quit! Then in the next two weeks, I added more hill repeats and tapered in the last week.

# Pre-race

I picked my bib on Friday, two days before the race and also got a free gel from them. I only used gator for all my long runs. But I tried the gel in the Saturday shakeout run. It felt good so I decided to take it during the race, which I know was a risk factor. Glad it turned out worked well for me.

Since this was my first HM race ever. I was super excited the day before and tried my bib with different place of my shirt and my pants in case I felt uncomfortable during the race. I went to PSU dining hall and had whatever made with carbs, like fries, rice, fruits, etc.

One surprise was that I didn't expect anyone would come (especially because my gf was in another state). But one friend realized the race one day before and made a sign to cheer me up at the finish line. I appreciate it so much!

# Race

The weather was optimal the day before. However, it rained on race day. The temperature was still great. Since my best self time trial was 1:53 and it was on a very flat course with optimal weather. This race is hilly, rainy and muddy. I was aiming for a sub 2 before the race.

Mile 1 to mile 4: I didn't checked my watch in the beginning and just ran by feel. I followed some guys with a pace that I felt comfortable in the first two miles. Then starting from Mile 3, the hill started and I couldn't follow them anymore. I checked my watch and was amazed by my pace. I averaged 7:45 in the first two mile, which was faster than my 10k PB pace (about 7:55)! I slowed down a bit in Mile 3 as the elevation went up and was passed by a bunch of people.

Mile 4 to mile 7: After mile 4, I knew it was mostly flat until mile 7, and I averaged a pace of around 8:10 at mile 4. So I just kept going with it.

Mile 7 to mile 10: Mile 7 was a huge downhill, then followed by steep uphills in mile 8 and mile 9. I am glad I tried this course once before the race so I can anticipate what would happen. it was a challenge on the all the muscles. I did a little bit of research on how to run hills after I tried the course. I did more strength training and hill repeats. I also shortened my strides and used more momentum of my arms. I was proud that I ran the uphills without stopping.

Mile 10 to mile 12: This was the final smooth part before a huge uphill. I knew there would be a monster ahead so I just adjusted my breathe before the final climb.

Mile 12 to mile 13: The final monster was coming. It was a mile-long huge uphill. I slowed down a bit and ran steadily. I knew the finishing line would be there once the hill was over. My pace was 8:11 before the final hill so I knew I could definitely PB this race, which gave me more motivation to climb the hill.

Finish line: I passed the finish line and the time was 1:46:xx. I was surprised by the results. I also saw some friends at the finishing line, which I didn't expect. I was just so happy at this time point.

I walked every water stop and took a cup of gator. I also tapped every single ""TAP ME"" sign along the way. They gave me some extra energy like the coins in Mario Kart.

Post-race

The GPS of my watch was a bit off because of the rain on it. It only captured a distance of 12.93 miles with an average pace of 8:14. The official time was 1:46 and pace was 8:07. I was super excited that I PB'd so much. 7 minutes off on such a hilly, rainy and muddy course! The taper did a magic to my legs.

I also planned to run a negative split, which I think I could finish happily without hurting myself. I did the previous PB on a flat course with negative split. But the hills made it almost impossible to compare the pace during the race. So i mostly ran by feel.

I knew this is a super long post as I was so excited to share my first HM race experience. It was incredible and I appreciate anyone who finished reading it.

\### Training

Last fall and winter I did my first and second marathons, the Rock and Roll San Antonio (3:42:59) and Houston Marathon (3:36:44) -- after never running more than a 5k prior to training for the two.  For both I cramped badly after mile twenty and didn't finish as strong as I knew I could.  Despite that, I was hooked.  After finishing Houston, I set a Boston Qualifying time (3:10 for M40-44) as my goal; perhaps a little ambitious, but a goal should be.

I was hunting around for a fast marathon and stumbled onto the South Texas International Marathon, which is new for this year.  The course looked fast and running an inaugural event sounded fun.  What sealed it was my wife, Sara, grew up in the Rio Grande Valley and wanted to run it with me (she ran the Rock and Roll with me as well).

The first step was building a solid base over the spring and summer-- this worked out to roughly 40 miles per week.  Most of the runs were at an easy pace but I threw in some 5ks for speedwork and some interval training.  Nothing structured, just laying the foundation for my marathon training block starting in late summer.

I worked up a 16 week plan cobbled together from a few different online plans.

1	6 mi easy	6.5 mi trail	6 mi 800m interval	6 mi easy	6 mi tempo	rest	14 mi	44.5

2	6 mi easy	6.5 mi trail	6 mi 800m interval	8 mi easy	3 mi push	rest	16 mi	45.5

16	3 mi easy	6 mi easy	3 mi easy	6 mi easy	rest	rest	26.2 RACE	44.2

The numbers at the end of each row are the mileage totals.  I made a few tweaks as the plan progressed but completed every run listed.  I raced the Scallywompus Texas Eclipse Ring of Fire in October as a check-up on my progress and PRed with a 1:33:33.  I was making big progress, but I got the sense that I wasn't going to be ready for a BQ by early December.  I still felt strong during the process and was confident that even if I didn't BQ I'd PR and likely also Chicago Qualify (3:20 M40-44).

In retrospect, I should have incorporated more time at pace on my long runs.  Aside from a 16 mile run four weeks out from the race I spent most of my long runs at an easy pace.  I felt the volume was adequate, but I didn't really get to know how pushing the pace I wanted while fatigued would feel and how to deal with it.

\### Pre-race

I tapered for three weeks -- I probably should have cut mileage a little more on the final two weeks.   
 Carb-loading the week before went deliciously.  The only issue was tweaking my back badly the Friday before the race washing my car -- randomly throwing out your back is just a peril of middle age.  The day before the race Sara and I drove down from San Antonio, picked up our packets at the expo, and drove the course.  We stayed at Quality Inn about 1.5 miles from the starting line.  We had a lovely pasta dinner at the Olive Garden, a glass of red wine made it easy to get to sleep early, despite pre-race nerves.  I assembled my kit the night before, got about 7 hours of sleep, and woke at 5 AM ready to run.  I had coffee and pop-tarts for breakfast and headed to the race.

\### Race

The weather was just about perfect with a cloudy sky and temperatures in the low 60s.  Staging was in the Donna, Texas recreational center about four blocks from the starting line at the Donna City Park.  For a smaller race being run for the first time, the start was well organized.  There weren't enough runners to merit separate corrals so everyone, marathoners and relay-runners (the race had a 5 and 2 man relay over the marathon distance), gathered behind the starting gate.  I started near the back so Sara and I could see each other off.

The first mile was spent weaving in and out of the pack, getting loose, and getting up to pace.  I planned on running an even 7:10/mi pace to put me slightly under a BQ so after the first mile I picked up the pace to balance out that first mile split.  At this point I was with a relatively small group of marathoners and relay-runners running between a 7:00 and 7:10 pace.  The first few miles ticked by pretty easy.  By the time we hit the only (minor) hills on the course near the half-marathon mark the group I was with had thinned out but I noticed that I was having trouble keeping the planned pace.  Thinking back on my last marathons, cramping up in the last 10k, I decided to slow to a 7:30 pace.

From mile 13 to 20 I held pace as planned and enjoyed the course.  The race went through some of the poorest areas of Texas but the support was wonderful and there's a beauty in small towns you notice when you're traversing them on foot.  By this point the temperature had warmed up to the mid-60s but I was still feeling relatively strong.

At mile 21 my legs got heavy.  I could see highway I-2 in the distance and knew the course would pivot to the finish right before the highway -- having the ""end"" in sight kept me going.  I checked my watch and realized if I held an 8:00 pace through the finish I'd CQ -- so I dialed it back and held on.  By this point the group I'd been running with was gone either in front or behind, but I was periodically joined by relay runners.  At mile 22 I started to feel a cramp coming on -- I planned on holding out till mile 23 to have a pickle juice shot I'd packed but a blister popped under my right index toenail and that almost stopped me cold.  I briefly paused at the initial pain and took the pickle shot -- the pain quickly faded and the shot dealt with the cramps.  I started running again and ground it out through the finish.  I couldn't find any more pace for the last few miles, but when I crossed the line with a CQ and PR the feeling was incredible.

For fueling I took a gel every thirty minutes and a salt tablet every hour.  I'd walk briefly for gels and tablets -- this accounts for the increases on some of the early splits.  For water I had a 2L water vest with a tube; I like being able to sip water when I feel like it rather than wait for an aid station.  I had a gel and a salt tablet right before the starting line.  I kept a pickle shot (mentioned above) for emergency use if I felt cramps coming on.

\### Post-race

After the race I was elated!  While I didn't BQ, I saw that my training was effective and know that with more work I'll be able to get there.  I spent about an hour wandering around taking in the finish line party and gently stretching my legs.  After that I enjoyed some BBQ and beers while keeping tabs on Sara's progress.  I cheered her over the finish line, handed her a finisher's medal, and we ubered back to our hotel to recover and bask in a glorious run.

1647,1701791955.0,Hot Footin’ it for the Kids (St. Jude Memphis Marathon Weekend),"Race info:

Name: St Jude Memphis Marathon Weekend

Date: December 2, 2023

Distance:  13.1 miles

Official Finish Time: 2:20:09 

Race Splits

3.1 miles: 30:54 (9:58)

6.2 miles: 32:02 (10:20)

9.3 miles: 33:29 (10:48)

13.1 miles: 42:30 (11:11)

Overall pace: 10:37

Goals:

1. Hit Hero goal ($1750) - yes
2. Beat last year’s St. Jude Half (2:31:35) - yes
3. No restroom stops - yes
4. Finish in 2:22 or better - yes
5. Finish in 2:15 (I knew this one would be a HUGE stretch so I’m not disappointed) - no. Was on pace for this for the first 9 miles but the massive nausea that kicked in around 6.5 miles derailed this as I got farther into the run.

Background:
Ran track/cross country in high school. Ran for pleasure in my 20s. Took about a 10-year hiatus from running - three pregnancies/4 children. Started back to running in 2018. Got back in pretty good shape. In 2021, I ran 12 miles the whole year.

In December 2021, I got an Apple Watch for Christmas and got started back to running (C25K, C210K). Signed up for St. Jude’s Memphis Marathon Weekend half a few days after my 42nd birthday. Followed St. Jude’s training plan that has a maximum long run of 15. Did my race in 2:31:35, including a 3:05 stop at mile 8 for the porta toilets. Crossed the finish line, said I wouldn’t do it again, and well… in May 2023, I signed up again. Silver level hero both years.

43 year old woman/was 160ish at start - have lost about 10# this training cycle.

Plan

Decided that St. Jude’s plan was a little overkill with two long runs of 13 and a 15 miler. So I started investigating other running plans. Had a few calls with a running coach. His price and my budget didn’t align so I used some of his free resources for diet, weight training, etc. Printed off Runner’s World 2:15-2:30 plan. Signed up for Hal. In week 1, Hal worked better for my schedule, so I did Intermediate Hal Higdon with a goal of 2:20. 

Training

Tuesday/Thursday/Friday - runs. 8 of these were HMP. I did a 5K on my third week of training. It sucked and my time was abysmal (almost 37 minutes, shin splints, asthma woes, etc).  This made me very nervous.

Sunday - long run day - three were scheduled as race simulations. 

Monday/Wednesday/Saturday - rest days. I still got 10K plus steps on these days and Saturdays were typically active rest days with yard work, housework, riding bikes with my kids, etc. 

I wanted to focus on weight lifting a couple of times a week but life got in the way. 

Completed most of my workouts as prescribed (sometimes faster). Was off target for 4, skipped 2. Hal is BOSSY. And opinionated. And as a data analyst, I take exception to running faster than plan = more compliant while running slower than plan is less compliant (both should be deductions because faster or slower means you didn’t follow the plan, but I digress). 

Last week before the race, I didn’t get to run as much as scheduled, but I took a “hay is in the barn approach.” At that point, I had run 215.5 miles between 9/9 and 11/30. 

My plan at that point was

1. Get to Memphis
2. Pick up the expo pack
3. Get some pasta for dinner
4. Get in the bed at a reasonable hour
5. Wake up. Eat. Hoof it from the hotel to the start line (about a mile).

Pre-race
Woke up at 6:00 and forced myself out of bed by 6:25. Drank a cup of coffee, ate a P3 pack, a banana, and some crackers. 

Had my stuff together. My mom was looking for something when I realized that it was 7:14

Uh, we gotta go!

I had a dream a few months earlier about running late on race day and not being able to run because I hadn’t written a Valentine’s Day Haiku. 

We arrived at the stadium at 7:35 AM - and had to navigate the crowds for the in-progress 5K and 10K. Went to my team’s hospitality suite and dropped my bag, hugged some friends, went to the restroom a couple of times, and got down to my corral (8 this year v M/13 last year).

Stretched and shuffled forward as each corral got its start. Saw that the pacer for my corral was 10:18. A minor panic set in.

I had set up my run in 4 segments on my Apple Watch

First 5K: 11:15/mile

Second 5K: 11:00/mile

Thirst 5K: 10:40/mile

The remainder of race: 10:30/mile

I accidentally set my watch to alert on the current pace, leaving me with 140 segments clocked. Lesson learned for next time… set it to alert when “average pace” is behind the target.

Different course than the previous year. It was down by the river for a decent chunk. 

Race:
Started at 8:15:13.

Miles 1 and 2: faster than planned. Kept getting mentally sidetracked by the constant buzzing of my watch. Went with my plan to walk through hydration stations instead of drowning myself while running. 

Miles 3 and 4: finally able to tune out the buzzing. Probably because Mile 2 was at 238 feet and the peak between Miles 2 and 4 was 287 feet. Settled down a little bit and got into my routine. Lots of folks cheering us along

Miles 5 and 6: running along the Mississippi. My mom shot some great videos of me running. Coming back up from the river was rough. Had to walk, right as my watch was letting me know that I had finished my second 5K in 32:02. Remembering that my first 5K had been 30:54, I realized I had a new 10K PR and speed walked the rest of the hill, starting to run again as we hit the next street. 

Miles 7 and 8: holy Hannah the nausea set in. I drank Gatorade at the hydration station. That plus the sugar from Jelly Belly energy beans made me straight up nauseated. And I was wishing that I had an antacid at that point. I refused to look down at my watch and was just in survival mode at that point. Had to stop and walk a couple of times to try to pull myself out of nausea waves.  Also, got passed by a guy, wearing a Pope Costume, complete with a hat and staff (we finished within about 30 seconds of each other. Last year it was “I cannot get smoked by a dude running in Tevas.” This year, it was, “I can’t get smoked by a dude in papal regalia.” Always good to pick someone to keep up with.)

Miles 9-10: I ended up behind a woman who had a shirt stating that her son and daughter are St. Jude patients. Her daughter had died a week earlier. I was like, “If she can be out here running a week after burying her baby, I can make it 4 more miles.” Last year, we came through campus earlier in the race. The families were cheering us on. It’s truly heartwarming. We came out of campus at mile 10, entering the Evergreen neighborhood around mile 10.5

Miles 10.5-11.5: Evergreen neighborhood. These folks rock. They do an awesome job of supporting St. Jude runners and even had folks committed until the course closed. They had folks handing out water to marathoners late in the day. They had dancing pickles, pickle juice, donuts, various shots, Gatorade, and water along the way. At mile 11, I drank some water and was then punched in the face by the smell of Fireball Whiskey as a tent was handing out shots (I politely declined given the nausea I already had going). Evergreen also has the “then and now” pictures of St Jude patients, including one former patient who ran the full marathon at 18 this year.

Mile 12: Hit Danny Thomas Blvd and began running toward the finish line. I knew the exit ramp awaited me (we had this part of the course last year). I dug deep, had to walk a little, and noticed at mile 12 that I was at 2:06, so beating last year was DEFINITELY a possibility. At that point, I knew 2:15 was out but 2:20 was still totally plausible for 1.1 more miles. 

Crossed the finish line. Forgot to smile for the camera. Have a hilariously terrible finish line picture followed by one from about 20 feet later where I’m all smiles with my medal. 

Verdict: was planning to focus on speed work and 5K/10K next year. But after beating my previous one by 11:26, I kinda wanna do another half. Will it be Memphis? Maybe. My work team had 228 people this year and has raised $660K for St. Jude. So I know we will have a stout goal next year. Not sure what silver-level hero commitment will be. Part of me is wondering about maybe doing a Rock N Roll series.",running

### Training
I started training in mid-June, 2 months after my first marathon in Paris this year, where the general consensus was that:

- I was overtrained, starting crossfit 2 weeks before the race lol
- I burnt out, leading to my training being sub-optimal, with an average of like 40K the last 6 weeks or something like that

So for my 2nd marathon I went with Pfitz 12/55, aiming for 3h15, and starting in early-September, with a couple months of so of base building while strength training, went up to 50K on average before going into Pfitz, which was doable. Program was tough but enjoyable. Medium long runs sucked though. 
I made sure to drop a few kms here and there, I was fed up with running 5x per week in the last month and a half, so instead of doing a Paris 2.0 and cutting volume by half, I only dropped a couple kms here and there when I was feeling down. 
Had to switch around some runs to accomodate for a 5K and 10K in October and November, where I PRed (5K: 20min -> 19:41 with hot weather and poor hydration, dry mouth, and 10K: 43:20 to 42:20, fatigued, wet ground and had to slalom around slower runners in the first 5K, had at least 30sec in me ), which is nice. 
Went harder than necessary on some longer runs because it was so fucking boring to run 32K at MP+10/20%, so I ran at MP or MP+5%. MP for 3h15 is 4:40min/km, I think I ran my last 32K at 4:50min/km, and it was fine, so that's good, right ?
The last 6 weeks were extremely tough mentally though, it was raining all day everyday, had some of my worst runs, and had no motivation to run, all discipline. I think I skipped one or two workouts, which were the first times that it happened to me, possibly ever. I tapered quite heavily, running less than expected, but as people always say, better be overtapered than overtrained. 
Main difference here in that prep is that I dropped all leg strength training in the last 8 weeks. I found that it screwed me up, the longer runs were harder on my legs than on my heart, and the marathon left my legs beat up more than my heart. There were times where I could barely run, but the little I could run could be ran with nose-breath, which I usually never do unless it's a recovery run. 

### Pre-race
Arrived in Valencia on Friday after an 8h30 drive. Ate out everyday there, filling up with carbs ( which I didn't do in Paris ), had the classic pasta bolognese the night before. 
Did my shakeout run on Saturday while going to get my bib, that was like 5 or 6K, with a bit of walking in the expo building, and walking in hills instead of jogging them. 
Woke up at 5am, had 3 slices of peanut butter on white bread, and I was fucking starving 1h30 later. I usually wake up and run an hour later or so, this time I had to take the bus for an hour to go to the starting line, so I had to wake up at 5am to eat, drink my caffeine and go to the bathroom. So 1h30 later I'm starving in the bus, so I take one gel 20min before the start.

### Race
I felt much fresher there than in Paris 8 months ago, way more bouncy, mcuh fresher, didn't have the best sleep, but had a better preparation, better taper etc..
Everything went well until the first half. I had the same feeling as in Paris, where I could feel that digestion was a bit tough. Easier than in Paris ( I switch from fruit jellies to gels ), but still harder than in training. I had no digestion issue in training, despite sometimes running in colder or hotter weather than in Valencia. So wtf ?
I had to stop taking my gels after 2h/25K, which left me with 17K to run without gels. I had to drink more though, but I didn't feel like it really hydrated me. 
You can see my splits go from sub 5min to over 5min, and I never recovered. I had to start walking/running after 30K or so, despite struggling with all the energy I had left. It's like I was in Paris again. Same symptoms, same race. 
After 32K or so at one of the drink stations I take one of those fruit flavoured drinks, not really knowing what that was, except that it'd give me the carbs I couldn't get from the gels. I wish I had done that earlier, it gave me a solid boost for a couple minutes afterwards, and my body was fucking craving it at each drink station, I took two of those at each drink station from there onwards. 
I later realised these were in fact electrolytes, which led me to believe that maybe one of the issues in Paris and Valencia was that I didn't have electrolytes ? 
One of the main issue in Valencia was that when it was time to start running again, it honestly felt as hard as having to deadlift or squat my PRs, I was wincing for the first few steps, best metaphor I can think of is trying to start an engine with heavy-ass pieces, taking a tremendous amount of energy to even start and maintain alive. That was literally how I pictured my legs at that time. My glutes were killing me. 
I finish the last 10/12K walking and running, and could gather enough strength to run continously for the last 3K, at a pace that was feeling like 7min/km but was apparently sub 6min/km, which is usually my recovery pace. 
I see the blue carpet, and start running faster, see the finish line and everyone cheering, almost got watery-eyes a couple times in those last 300m, and cross the finish line, finally.

### Post-race
Post race was loads better than Paris. In Paris I was sick, had to take a cab home, and could barely swallow anything for a couple hours afterwards, almost puked in the afternoon following the race, had the worst hiccups I've ever had and probably will ever have. This time was much better, it took my a solid 20min to exit the finish zone, and had to stop a couple times to recover a bit. 
I could drink and eat much easier than in Paris, which is nice, and had a much better post-race time than in Paris. DOMS are quite strong though, my legs did take a beating. 
Next up is Paris half in March, marathon in early April, and an HYROX competition in late-April in my city. 
The plan is to get back to my 130/110/200kgs SBD in the next few months, while trying to surf as good as possible on my marathon fitness, trying to keep as much cardio as possible for Paris next year. Right now I'm thinking 3x strength training, 3x running, and 1x hyrox training. 
I am planning on registering for Valencia next year, that feeling on the blue carpet was amazing. 

### Questions
- Could electrolytes be (one of) the reason why I crashed in both instances ? My face was all salty, and I have a tendancy to be a pretty heavy sweater. 
- Any plan you'd recommend to maintain my marathon fitness in the next few months ? I've thought of FIRST, with a bit of cardio at the crossfit box as cross training, but do you think I could pick it up halfway through the program ? 
I've also thought of focusing on the half marathon, which I've never run in a race, and running the marathon as a sort of last very long training session for the hyrox competition, more of a mental workout than physical, not aiming for a specific time. Any program you'd recommend ? 

Thanks !

**Background:**  
I come from a competitive cycling background but transitioned to running during the pandemic. This was my 5th marathon (plus one ultra 50K). My goal for this race was to BQ, and given the cutoff time for Boston for this year, get a 5 minute buffer. Despite some setbacks and illness, training went okay and I even set my half PR (1:26) in a warm up race a few weeks before CIM. I felt ready and capable of BQing this year.   
  
  
**Pre-race:**  
I was sick with a bad cold for the entire week leading up to CIM. The day before the race, I still felt pretty sick and was in bed most of the day trying to rest in a desperate attempt to sleep it off. By morning, I actually felt better but not 100%. I got up at 3am, ate a bland breakfast and did some light stretching and warm up. I live in Sacramento, so I was able to drive to the bus transportation line. Last year at CIM, there was huge mix up with the busses and I stood in line for over an hour in the cold rain resulting in my legs being fatigued and stiff by the time the race started. I was determined to not let that happen again. I ran into a former colleague in the lines and had a nice chat, which helped to ease the tension. On the bus I sat next a cool guy that was from Maryland and was hoping to run a 2:38. I didn't get his name, so I wasn't able to check his time, but hopefully he met his goal!  
  
**Race:**  
While warming up for the race, I wasn't feeling super strong but was determined to still try to BQ. In retrospect that was a bad idea and I really should have tampered my expectations and goals. I started the race in the 3:00 hour group and honestly felt okay for the first 9 miles. I was eating every 4 miles, carried a water in bottle, and took nuun at every aid station. Between the 10-12 mile mark, I was still feeling okay and truly believed that if I tried, I would BQ and at the very least PR. By the halfway point though, my body started to fatigue and began to lose contact with the 3hour pace group. I gradually let off the gas and begrudgingly accepted I wasn't going to break 3 hours that day. Around the 15 mile marker, my pace slowed dramatically, while my perceived effort increased to my dismay. Around the 17-18 mile mark I really started to struggle and my pace continued to slow. Heartbreakingly, I began to realize that not only was I not going to BQ, I may struggle to even finish. I just felt so awful, and it continued to get worse. I kept eating every 3-4 miles, drank water and nuun at every aid station, and now focused only on finishing. Near the 23.5 mile mark, I was running and when all of a sudden everything started getting dark and I felt like I was falling. In an instant, I stumbled but caught myself on my feet and knew that I had to stop running. I was milliseconds from passing out and hitting the ground and realized that I had pushed too hard. Then, for the first time ever in a road race, I walked. My eyes watered and I was so bummed, but I kept moving forward, walking as fast as I could. After about 5-10 minutes of walking, I felt a little better and started running at the motivation of fellow runners. I continued to run all the way through the finish line, finishing in just over 3:20. I crossed the line and almost passed out again and nearly threw up. It took a few minutes for the feeling to go away.  After I stood back up, I was then immediately overwhelmed with so many emotions.  


**Post-race:**  
My family met me at the finish line and were so supportive. I know 3 hours and 20 minutes is a decent time, but I trained so hard and put in so much time and effort to break 3 hours. I was devastated, and honestly I cried at the finish line. However, I finished and am so proud of myself for persevering and pushing through to the end. I woke up this morning, the day after the race, and am pretty sore and still feel sick. I plan to take a week or two off from all physical activity to allow my body to rest and recover. There's always next year and I absolutely plan to race CIM again next year. It's such a well-organized race that runs through my old neighborhoods. The weather is usually excellent, the crowds are fantastic. and the volunteers were absolute champions. A sincere thank you to all those that came out to cheer on the runners, hand out goodies, or those that ran the aid stations. You were all amazing! Congrats to all those that ran this year, even if you didn't finish! You're amazing for even showing up and giving it your best!

### Training
31M running third marathon. First was a 3:44 at NYC 2016, for which I ramped up training too quickly and got such a bad stress fracture in my right tibia during the race that I was on a cane for months afterwards. 

Picked running up again about 2 years ago, and returned to the full marathon distance with a 3:28:57 at the Big Sur International Marathon in April 2023. Coming out of Big Sur, I was curious what my time would’ve been on a less punishing course and signed up for CIM. A long term goal was qualifying for Boston, but I figured I would need at least one more year of training before breaking 3 hours would be in the cards.

Building up to CIM, I once again followed Pfitz 18/55 which I felt very positively about. My MP runs felt strong, but I struggled to keep a true race pace (sub-7 minute miles) by myself in training. My two tune-up races - a 39:08 at a hilly 10K and a 1:26:23 half - suggested that I was in better shape than I expected and according to VDOT tables a sub-3 marathon might be possible, though I was nervous about going out too quickly and blowing up. 


### Pre-Race
My original plan was to start out with the 3:05 pacers and go for a negative split. But on the 4:30 am shuttle to the start line, I met a group of guys who had similar times and were planning on going for a “full send” and going sub-3. At that point, my competitive instincts kicked in and I talked myself into getting aggressive and going for it too. So there I found myself lined up with the massive 3:00 pace group as dawn broke in Sacramento.

### Race
I stuck with the new friends from the shuttle for the first 5 or so miles within the dense pack of hundreds of sub-3 runners. I was already getting nervous when I noticed that I was hovering around a 6:35-6:45 pace, which was below the 6:52 pace for a 3:00 finish and well below the 7:03 pace for a 3:05 finish I had originally been thinking about. But I was feeling good, so I tried not to overthink it and just kept the pace.

At the halfway point, I realized that I had gone only 1 minute slower than the half marathon I had raced a month previously and gulped, knowing that the real work was about to start soon. Around this time, I started telling myself “Just keep this pace until the end of the mile, and then if you want to slow down you can.” This trick worked for a surprisingly long time, and I was able to just keep stacking speedy miles together. 

I got a helpful spite-based speed boost when I got shoved from behind and cursed at by some jerk during a traffic jam at the 18-mile aid station. I was so annoyed that I wanted to leave him in my dust, which probably kept my pace up for a couple miles longer than I would’ve otherwise been able to. 

It was during mile 22 that I could really feel it all catching up to me. My hamstrings had gotten absurdly tight, and I felt on the verge of a major cramp that could ruin the day. I allowed myself to slow down a bit to prevent that from happening while still keeping an eye on my average pace to make sure that I wasn’t going to lose the sub-3 after such a fantastic first 80% of the race. 

I barely remember the last 5K, and came to while crossing the finish line in front of the Capitol building, strangely overcome by emotion. 


## Post-Race
As I came back to my senses, I was so shocked and proud by how well the race had gone, with a 2:57:43 good for a 31-minute PR and overshooting my greatest hopes about what was possible for this race. I gave the BQ bell a nice ring and shuffled back to the hotel.

One reason that I’m sharing this story is to give a counterpoint to the cautionary tales I see here that can drive people (like me!) to more conservative strategies. I probably outkicked my coverage on this race and came very close to a disastrous blow up, but it worked out and I’m thrilled that I gave myself the opportunity to achieve this level of win.",running

### Background
I'm 34 yo M who has absolutely no background in running. I've always been relatively athletic and I'm extremely competitive. My sports in high school were basketball and tennis. Although in basketball, I don't think I ever ran more than 2 miles at a time. I think my fastest mile time in high school was 5:55. After high school I kept lifting weights, but stopped doing as much cardio as I had previously done. Around 10 years ago I began gaining a lot of weight due to inactivity and a very demanding job that exacerbated my inactivity. About 2 years ago I got serious about weightloss and began doing significantly more cardio along with a ton of weight lifting. Ended up losing 100 lbs and got more into running. I'm 5'11 and went from 300lbs to 200lbs which is the weight I ran the half at. 

It wasn't until about 6 months ago that I began to get serious about running; however, when I ran a 5k beer run for fun and realized I really enjoyed running competitions. I ran that 5k in 25 minutes flat. That was the first time in my life I had run further than 3 miles. I decided to sign up for a 10k nighttime trail run a few weeks later, which was a blast. Ran that in 1:08, although I was running with my GF who made me promise not to ditch her given how dark it was and how easy it was to get lost on the trail. I made the decision the day after this run to sign up for the SA RNR half. 

### Training
I read through a bunch of different plans, got suggested a ton, but none of them seemed to either not align with my goals, or were a bit too structured when, because of my job which has me working at all days and hours, I could not be too structured in my training. My goal for the race was to run it as fast as I possibly could. I knew I could complete a half, but I had no clue what a realistic time was for me. I had never really seriously attempted to run a race as fast as I possibly could. 

I ultimately just decided to take recommendations from others on the r/advancedrunning sub on how to structure a training block. I planned to run a long run once every 2 weeks, do a tempo or interval run once a week, and then do the rest at easy paces. I had 4.5 months to train, as well, which really helped. My first run after I decided to do it was to run 10 miles at a comfortable pace. That run was a big psychological booster that helped demonstrate to me that I could do this. I was previously running about 10 miles a week. I increased that to 20 miles a week immediately (obviously too quickly). I initially developed some ITB issues in my right knee, so took a week off, about 4 weeks in. Decided to change my running gait from heel striking to forefoot striking, then went back into running 25-30 miles per week (obviously too quickly).  

I developed some pretty bad plantar fasciitis in my left foot about a month and a half later, so decided to take a week and a half off, and just did rowing in that down time. Jumped back into it, but this time again changing my gait to a midfoot strike which definitely felt the most comfortable for me of all the gaits. Went back to running 25-30 miles per week. I ran a 5k beer run a month out from the half and ran it at 21:30 (6:56/mi pace) which surprised me, but gave me the confidence to push for a faster goal than I was aiming for. A month out, my goal was 1:50, but after the 5k I moved the goal down to 1:45. 

My last month was significantly more tempo and interval runs. I eventually got up to 45 miles in a week 2 weeks out for the half, and began to taper down from there. My last tempo run was 2.5 weeks out and ran 7 miles at a 7:55 pace. My last long run was 2 weeks out and I ran 12 miles at an 8:16 pace.

My last week was a single relatively fast run at only 2.5 miles on Monday, and the rest were easy 2-4 miles runs. I took Friday off and Saturday I did a 5k beer at an easy pace for a warm up. I had a couple beers, ate a crap ton of BBQ which was probably a mistake, ate a few beignets, tried to take a laxative which didn't work but was too afraid to take anymore, and then went to sleep very early that night. 

### Pre-race
I woke up that morning, drank an energy drink in hopes that it would wake up the bowels (it didn't), I even abstained from caffeine for a week to increase the caffeine's effect. I took some imodium about 30 minutes before the race, as my biggest fear was that I was going to shit myself during the race, which nearly happened to me multiple times during some of my long runs. I ate 2 caffeine GU energy gels about 20 minutes out. I then realized I really needed to pee for like the 4th time that morning. Unfortunately RnR thought it only necessary to provide 5 toilets per corral, so I ended up running out in the 6th corral instead of the 3rd. 

### Race
The weather was perfect. Race started at 46 degrees F and ended at 53F. I came out with a plan to run at an 8:05 pace and see how I felt. Because I got stuck in corral 6, I had to do a TON of bobbing and weaving basically throughout the entire race. The first 2 miles felt easy, like I was going too slow. There was a slight point during mile 3 when I felt like I might be getting fatigued, although that sensation faded fairly quickly. The 5th mile is where things got interesting. I knew mile 5 would have a large hill, basically the entire 5th mile is an uphill climb, and I figured if I could maintain pace on this mile, I could probably increase my pace significantly afterward on the downhill and then just ride that faster pace to the finish. I actually ended up increasing my pace slightly on that hill and as soon as I started heading downhill, I knew I was going to beat 1:45. The rest of the race is kind of a blur. I just kept looking down at my watch and seeing my pace consistently increasing which gave me more confidence, as my legs felt great and I didn't really feel too fatigued. 

The last 3 miles felt like a sprint. I felt the fatigue finally hitting me on mile 12, but at that point, I knew there was no way I was slowing down. I crossed the finish line took a couple second breather, and then felt like I could still go another couple miles. I definitely left some time on the table. I think I could easily break 1:40 on the right course with a little bit more training and less bobbing and weaving. 

### Post-race
Waited for a few of my friends to finish up. I changed out of my shoes and shirt and we went to grab some beers. We then went to grab some tacos far away from downtown at one of my favorite places in SA. I then went home and relaxed with my GF and ate some Via 313 pizza that night. 

Overall I'm very happy with my performance, but also know I could go even faster than my time. My next half is the Austin Half, but I know that course is a bit more challenging. I also am doing the San Fran half which will be even more challenging, but they should be fun. I might do the Dallas or Houston full marathon in a year, but I want to enjoy running halfs for now.

### Training
For my first half marathon, after having ran a couple of 10k this year, I chose to go with Hal Higdon's Intermediate 1 program, with some tweaks to meet demands with my work, strength training and basically everything else. That meant a day less of running (5 down to 4) alongside 3 days of strength training and 2 days of yoga.

I think I could've done better, especially during the mid-part between week 5 and 8, as I often couldn't go on the weekly long run and had to settle for shorter run. Also most times I'd actually do just 2 days of strength training, especially when I felt tired after the morning run (my rule was to do running in the morning and gym in the evening).

Overall I felt good with my running though, plus my 10k race in the middle of training went pretty damn good (53:44, PB by almost 6 minutes) so I felt confident in my target, which was basically to run in 2 hours at a 5:40 min/km pace. 

Another factor that really improved my fitness was also going to an actual running shop to analyze my foot and to buy a suggested pair of shoes (which turned out to be the Saucony Guide 16).

### Pre-race
The day before the race was pretty calm, as I spent some time in the afternoon with my friends, went to grab my bib and race pack, and then had a good dinner with lot of carbs. For the race, I planned to run with my Flipbelt, containing 3 gels to take every 30 minutes. 

Since the weather forecast was pretty cold (around 3°C at start, 5°C at finish), I had a shirt under my actual running shirt, gloves, shorts and medium-length socks. Probably the best choice for equipment, as I didn't really feel cold or hot.

### Race
I started out maybe a bit too much on the front-side of the group, so I decided not to follow the others as much as I could. That was some good thinking, as the first km especially was pretty easy, but then I realized I went under 5 min/km on km 3, so I tried to slow down a bit. Once I settled and the groups started thinning, I really found my pace, which was faster then expected but not taxing at all. 

Around that time the course also started to a bit hilly, with some up and downs that can really test your training. I powered through better than expected on the uphills, while losing a bit on the downhills, took my first gel and my first cup of water at 5k.

For the next 8-9k everything went really smoothly: I saw the first guy absolutely flying around km 8, which meant he was more than 4 km ahead of me, as the course had a turn-around at km 11. Took my second gel and went through the second station, all while thinking that this was going way too well. I was sure to hit a wall at km 12-13 but it didn't happen at all. If anything, I kept this steady pace all the way towards km 15. Oh, and somehow I discovered after the race that I set a new 10k PB at 53:17!

That was the biggest climb of the course, so I went in extra carefully. Still, legs were great and I ended up going slower than before but faster than the others around me. Suddenly, the uphill was over and I even had the time to take a quick pee, since I was definitely under the two hours mark considering my pace. Last gel right after, and I was ready to tackle the last 5k of the course.

The famous wall actually came in the last 2k, which I wasn't expecting at all as that was the most flat part of the whole HM, but I powered through just by thinking ""it's nothing, just 2k left, you did it plenty of time during training"". My left leg was a bit tired, there weren't many other runners around me, but I didn't want to walk even for a second. 1k, 2k down and I finally spotted the finish line with enough in me to put a last sprint, high five my friends on the side and finally finish my first HM under 2 hours.

### Post-race
I somehow felt better at the end than the other 10k I raced, maybe also thanks to the cold weather? But I received my medal, quickly went to grab the post race refreshments and chatted for a bit with the others. Being actually not as tired as I expected, I also went on a nice walk in the city for a good and deserved lunch, before heading back home.

Overall an amazing experience. The event was clearly well organized, great course, weather was amazing all morning, and most of all I had ton of fun. Absolutely looking for my next half marathon before going to the next step and race in a full marathon (hopefully at the end of 2024).

**Pre-race:**  
I’m a 39 year old guy who sits at a desk all day (CPA). I started running in August of 2021 specifically to do a marathon, crossed the finish line that December and since then my addiction has been on par with having a meth habit. I’ve now run 3 marathons, a 50k and 3 70.3s and my latest was Ironman California in October. I had 3 goals this year. First and foremost I wanted to complete an Ironman – check. I wanted to get under 4 hours in a marathon – check as of yesterday and I wanted to run a 50 miler. My coach called the 50 miler off in an effort to get a head start on triathlon training (in retrospect a great call) so I settled for a 50k.   
My first ever marathon I ran a 5:35, and the year after I put absolutely everything I had into it and I got a 4:25. At the beginning of the year getting under 4 hours seemed like a big task, but as I started working with a coach who quickly found that I was overtraining and had a love for frustrating him with what he calls “hero efforts” on slower paced workouts the improvement just kinda snowballed to the point where my easy runs were between 8:30 and 8:50. For a time I adjusted my goal to 3:30, which would be awesome to take an hour off each year I ran, but my biggest realization of the year was that I really enjoy the races where the accomplishment is finishing, not how fast you can finish. Equally, I hadn’t practiced that pace much because we were so focused on IMCA, which is not to complain, I crushed that race and am super happy with it. So this race lost a lot of hype in my mind. The plan was to run at least 5 miles with one of the coaches from my training group who paces 3:55. Just kinda take it from there and enjoy it, but the closer we got to the race and the more recovered I felt from IMCA the more I was getting some serious FOMO in talking to the people who had much faster goals. Literally until 10 minutes before the race I was debating if I try for 3:45. The good news about the loss of hype is that I slept super well two nights before the race and pretty great the night before, at least by race day standards of sleep for me.   
**Race Day:**  
I wake up at 2:30 and just kinda scroll on my phone for a bit. No hurry to get ready, but I can feel I’m not falling asleep before my 4:30 alarm at this point. Breakfast, get my gear on and my wife comes downstairs to wish me luck. She mentions I’m acting weird because I’m just so lackadaisical. My dad picks me up and takes me to the shuttles (literally less than a mile from my house, but walking felt equally silly). I meet with my training group at the running store near the start line and say hi to everyone. I’m still getting this feeling like maybe I should tell my coach to shove it and push, but I forcefully push those feelings down. Bigger goals next year, don’t screw it up by making this an ego race. We heard the race is delayed 10 minutes because some buses got delayed, so I find an empty lawn chair and just sit there and relax. Finally getting close to start, so I mosey over to near the 3:55 pacer and settle in talking with the coach and my friends from the training group. I overhear a conversation next to me between two women: “I ran a 3:25 and I felt awful afterwards. You know who cared? No one but me” and all of a sudden it hits me like a ton of bricks. You’ve had this epiphany the whole year about how you like to enjoy races and the joy comes from going longer, not faster. What are you doing? Enjoy the race, stop comparing yourself to the people you might be able to keep up with and have some fun. A switch flips, and we’re back. I’m locked in, let’s enjoy 26.2!  
**Course:**  
I'm going to blatantly plagiarize another post here because the description was accurate. I live 2 miles away from the start line so I was very familiar with most of the course. The race starts at Folsom Lake, about 2 miles from Folsom Prison (yes the one Johnny Cash sang about) and ends at the California State Capitol. Although the course is advertised as downhill course, it is not. FYI: The course does have a net elevation loss, but there are quite a lot of rollers throughout the course, especially in the first couple miles adding up to nearly 650 feet of climbing (per Strava) which is not a lot but it really adds up unexpectedly. Weather was pretty perfect in the low 50s at the start.  
**Race:**  
We get going, and I hang out just in front of the 3:55 pace group. I’m talking with people, I’m smiling like an idiot and complaining loudly about how this was supposed to be a downhill race on the first uphill. We get to 5 miles and I’m feeling good. I realize that I’m not a big fan of big pace groups, so while I’m not pushing hard to get away, I’m not limiting myself to their pace. I notice I’ve gotten a bit out in front as the cheers stop being “3:55! 3:55!”.   
I’m going easy, tracking my triathlon buddies at the 70.3 down in SoCal that’s also going on, texting my family about where they’ll be on the course. First time I get to see them is at mile 8.5. I get over to the right side of the road in preparation and then I get another moment of clarity. One of the absolute favorite pictures I have of running is last year’s CIM where my daughter handed me a Gatorade bottle and ran after me on the course. So I head over to them, I come to a complete stop, kiss my two boys (6 and 9) on the head and grab my daughters hand to run a short way with her. I’m enjoying the moment, and I’m making her day. This is what all the work is for. There is no universe where she cares about your time on this race, but she loves when she gets to run with daddy, and [I have another favorite picture and memory](https://imgur.com/a/ktvuoFT). This delay puts me back near the 3:55 group, but I just pull ahead again with my normal pace and go about my race. I get to see my family 2 more times on course and each time I do the same. The crowd loves it and I’m having a really good time.   
I’m going to quote Tolkien here, “Now it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and take a deal of telling anyway.” This race went well for me, and there isn’t much in the way of discomfort and suffering. I never had to dig deep, I didn’t have a time in the race where my mentality went dark. I’ve been there, and I’m actively seeking out races where I have to walk through that fire again, but it wasn’t this race. I saw friends, I made jokes, I paced people I saw that had fallen off a bit as much as I could. So there isn’t much to say about most of this race. The one memory I think I’ll always have though, is seeing my friend Kristen at mile 25.5 or so. I’m catching up to her and she’s definitely struggling a bit. I run up and tell her she’s looking strong or some other nothingness saying runners say to each other. But she’s having a hard time and not in a good head space. Now let me briefly tell you about Kristen. She is easily the most excitable person I’ve ever met. Her pure joy whenever I’ve done group runs with her is contagious which is only exceeded by how good a person she is. She’s written a children’s book. She always makes a point to tell me how proud she is of me after every damn race I do. We don’t hang out or anything, but I absolutely love when there’s a group run with her in it. While I’m not exactly a motivational speaker, I think I can get her to push the last half mile here with me. So she picks up her pace and I just keep talking to her. Completely nonsensical things like, “You’ve been here before, it’s all pain management. You’ve had a kid, right? This is nothing” and “That’s the last corner right there, best corner on the course.” Like I said, this ain’t exactly my forte. But she takes it in stride, keeps up and we cross the finish line together. [I turn to give her a high five, and she grabs me and hugs me. I realize I’m right where I’m supposed to be](https://youtube.com/shorts/3a6fhQLwIhQ?feature=share). She says she needed me that last half mile, but I needed her for that moment. This is a beautiful sport, the joy of the finish line is so pure, it’s what got me addicted in the first place. In that moment I was reminded why I’m addicted. It’s not to be fast, there won’t come a time when I’m winning any races, no matter how small. It’s from the pure inexplicable joy of finishing what you started on your feet.   
**Post-race:**  
This is where I usually talk about how hard it is to walk and how I slept on the couch downstairs because stairs are my mortal enemy. Not this year. My wife caught a bit of a cold and I told her to take a nap. I ran around the house chasing the kids, did a mediocre job of keeping the house clean and am generally upbeat. Just sitting here waiting for CIM to send me the registration email for next year. What I thought was an afterthought of a race has me excited for next year. 2024 Goals: Miwok 100k to get a ticket for Western States 100M lottery and to do a last man standing format race. I’ll be hitting a couple 70.3s and doing IMCA again as well. I absolutely love how I feel and how much energy I have. First week in December will always be saved for CIM. I don’t think that race ever gets old.",running
1663,1701616758.0,I do pilates exercises to improve my running (F29) are these exercises enough or should I do more strength training +,"Hello,

I am very new to running.
I only ever used to have motivation for 2-3 weeks and only managed to push through 2kms max...

Now I started again on the 18th on November and recently did my first 5k in 35.25mins, then ran some more  with breaks for walking ending up with  9.43kms in 1.06hrs.

Not much, I know but for me this is a tremendous achievement.

The difference I've noticed is that I've incorporated pilates into my workout routine years ago and it seems like my legs and bum became stronger.


I see w lot of runners saying that pilates is great for running and it wakes up the muscles you wouldn't usually use when you run.

I've got a couple of drumbells and two weight ""patches"" that you can wrap around the arms of legs to make it more difficult.

My worry is that I should still go to the gym and lift weights (not even sure which weight I need to lift).

I've been researching but problem is training running muscles is so versatile so there are tons of videos saying different things.

I'm afraid I'm missing something and I should actually go lift bigger weights?

I do want to do a half - marathon eventually as nothing helped me mentally as well as running in years and after each run end up feeling fantastic! 

Tl;dr female 29yo. Is pilates enough to complement running? Or are more serious weight exercises needed?",running
1664,1701632263.0,Adjustment Period Switching from Brooks to Hokas,"Hey everyone, I switched a few months ago from Brooks Adrenalines and Glycerins to Hoka Mach 5s. I wanted to switch to take advantage of Hokas low drop shoes, which would hopefully let me use more of my calf and provide a more natural run, and put less stress on my shins.

However, I've found myself going on much shorter runs to avoid injury. I previously had been able to run 10ks every once in a while with no problem in my Brooks, and did often get shin splints, but now I'm getting shin splints much faster. Any time I run over 5k at once I usually need a full week of recovery.

On top of that, I find that I need to use my feet muscles and ankles muscles much more in my Mach 5s. I like the way the shoes feel a lot, and do feel more natural and less restricted running in them, but it's been a couple months now and I'm still only running 2 miles at a time, and just starting to feel comfortable with 6 miles a week or so. My goal is to un a half marathon sometime in the spring.

Has anyone else experienced this? I'm wondering if this is pretty standard. I've never been able to run a half marathon before (I did one last year in UltraBoosts (also 12mm drop, like Adrenalines), but had *really* bad shin splints that may have been a stress fracture afterwards). I wanted to switch to more natural shoes since I felt the high drop support-based Adrenalines might be masking issues and preventing me from developing the necessary muscular structure to run injury free at long distances.

1668,1701649442.0,When do you know you’re ready for an ultra?,"Hey everybody.

Long time member, first time poster and really looking for some advice from some seasoned ultra runners.

I ran my first marathon in 2021 and since then life has been really busy. I kept my running up but the furthest I went for a couple years was around 10 miles. Over the last 6 months I’ve got back into the swing of things, doing 2 half marathons, my last one was last Sunday and I ran a 1:54 which I was pretty happy with.

So next year I’ll be running the Manchester marathon in April and the Edinburgh marathon in May and I’m loving being back into these longer distances.

I’ve seen an ultra online which is 42 miles on the 1st of June and I’d love to go for it. The only thing is to date I’ve only ran one marathon and will be doing these two next year and I’m not sure if I’m biting off more than I can chew.

Does it sound feasible and is two marathons a good way to train for this or does it sound like too much too soon? Keen to hear what people think as I’m quite torn on the whole thing. It’s also a trail run with some decent elevation and I do like trial running but haven’t done much more than a half marathon on the trails.

Any advice or general thoughts are appreciated. I appreciate you might never know if you’re ready and I should possibly just take the plunge but I’m just not sure.

EDIT:
I realised I got my dates wrong, the ultra is the 6th of July, no idea where I pulled the first of June from. Reading it back I realised how extra deranged it sounded.",running

\### Training  
After having a better than expected threshold test in October last year and a also surprisingly good 10k race in November I decided that my goal for this year in the marathon was going to be to run under 3:30, my previous best was a 3:56:40 at Stockholm in June 2022 so this was going to be quite the step up.  
I started this year with lots of other commitments so wasn't able to make that goal for Stockholm 2023 which I ended up finishing in 3:35:19 after a horrendous blowup in the second half.   
I took a month throughout June just running when I felt like it to prepare for the training block running up to the big goal of the year which was going to be Valencia marathon. For this block I made sure to put more of an emphasis on threshold training and marathon pace runs which I hadn't done since I started running instead focusing on lots of easy mileage.   
During the block I ended up running about 65k on average peaking at 100k since the start of July with most weeks consisting of 1-2 sessions either with threshold work or later on in the block intervals at marathon pace which I was planning on being 4:55-5:00 min/km. Also managed to relatively consistently build up my long run once a week to 32k with some of the shorter ones containing some blocks at marathon pace.  
I ran one half in September where I blew up but managed to run/walk my self across the line to a 1:42, and in early November I ran a new 10k PB of 43:15.   
\### Pre-race  
2 weeks before the race I had a return of some pain in my left knee which I persisted through since I could still run with my regular form, I went to see a PT on Tuesday who put some needles in my thigh to relieve some tension but the pain mostly persisted through the final week of runs which were all done in the newly arrived snow and cold weather where I live.  
Flew out to Valencia on Friday and did a 6k shakeout on Saturday which felt okay but nothing more then picked up my bib and went to check out the start and finish area.  
On race day I woke up at 5:30 and had a Maurten solid bar before breakfast where I ate 2 bread rolls and a pastry.   
Walked down the start area where I did some light jogging before taking a Maurten gel 20 minutes before the start a 8:55.  

\### Race  
I lined up in my box which was the 3:25-3:35:59 one and ended up about 10 rows back where I kept a look out for the pacers that were supposed to be there but couldn't find them, pre-race my plan was to just stick on the back of the 3:30 pacers at least for the first half to ensure I didn't go out too fast.  
As the race started I was able to settle in to a comfortable pace and after a quick check at 1k I could see it was at 5:01 so right on target considering it's the first k.  
The first half of the race I spent a lot of time making sure I didn't get ahead of my self just trying to stay in zone 2 where I was hovering around the top. I especially had troubles around the water stations where I found my self trying to keep the same pace which meant my heart rate went up by a few beats which I tried to avoid. Started feeling some fatigue in my quad muscles somewhere after 10k but it wasn't impacting my ability to run and the same with left knee pain which came and went throughout the race.  
Went through halfway in 1:42:59 where I noticed I was creeping into zone 3 and having trouble getting back down to zone 2 so my thinking there was that I had some breathing room on the 3:30 goal but that 3:25 was going to be very tough.   
After halfway the kilometers ticked a long, I took a gel every 6k and took water whenever it was given, and even though I know it's horrible for the environment getting water in bottles is so much nicer I feel, not having to shuffle around trying to get water from a cup into my mouth made it a lot easier than other races I've done.  
Tiredness in the legs were getting worse but I still was able to keep running relatively comfortably even though the heart rate was getting further away from zone 2 and inching closer to zone 4.  
As I passed 32k I think my watch said 2:36:20 which with some quick maths I figured out meant a final 10.2k in 48:40 to get to 3:25:00 which felt tough but not completely out of the question.   
At this point I was well into zone 4 and hovering there and the legs were starting to hurt but some way I was able to pick up the pace and do the 35-40k 5k in 23:45 and then a sprint finish down what felt like a long tunnel lined with amazing crowds before reaching the blue mat and seeing 3:23:xx on the clock at which point I knew 3:25 was going to be broken. The only small scare I had during this part was slight twinge in the right calf somewhere around 39-40k but considering the margin I had to 3:30 I didn't put that much thought into it and it never really got bad enough to care about, maybe it was just my quads burning at this point that made it not worth caring about.  
I finished in 3:24:28 which is almost an 11 minute pb.  
For the first time being able to negative split a marathon was a nice thing, first half in 1:43 and the second half in 1:41:30 and the last 7.2k in 33:40 I think indicates a really good strategy even though it was kind of put together on the fly.  
I think the 3 keys for this result for me was a really long solid training block, Valencia being a fantastic course, really flat and the crowds were amazing and even though it was sunny and some decently long parts of the race were in direct sunshine I felt the temperature never really went that high.   

\### Post-race  
Post-race I took a very slow walk back to the hotel where I promptly consumed absolutely everything edible and then took a very nice shower before writing this.  
As for the future I'm now going to take December as a bit of a reset, running when I feel like it, going and getting my knee properly checked out and getting back in the gym which I neglected during the last months of this training block to make sure I build my body up to be ready for whatever I decide will be my next goal.  
Of course the 3 hour marathon is there as a dream but I've now done lots of ""slow"" running and I think some quicker stuff is going to be a necessity for the future if a 3 hour marathon is going to happen.

### Training
I'm just coming off of my marathon training block for NYC and was salivating at the idea of using a turkey trot to test my 5K and potentially go sub-20. I've been eyeing sub-20 for a while but haven't been focused on anything speed related due to marathon training or injury. The only test I had was a 44:10 tuneup 10k from my training plan. I knew this meant I was close to sub-20 for 5k but was still really intimidated by the pace. I went in telling myself that I would settle for a PR if I realized I went out too hot in mile 1. 
### Pre-race
This is easily going to be the most entertaining part of the report and the entire reason I decided to write a report. 
We were flying to DC the day before the race and I already knew this was going to be painful. We woke up at 5AM (day before the race) to get to the airport extra early in case of Thanksgiving day rush. Due to the time change, we ended up arriving into DC at 11PM. Then, we hit a bunch of traffic while leaving the airport and didn't get to the hotel until midnight. Grabbed a quick vending machine meal (hot pockets) and called it a night - ended up getting to bed at 1:30 AM. The plan was to wake up at 7AM, leave the hotel by 7:30 and arrive to bib pickup by 8:15. This would give me enough time to squeeze in a 2-mile warmup right before the race start at 9:15AM.  Well, it went pretty smoothly to get out of the hotel and there wasn't much traffic due to it being Thanksgiving morning. Arrived right on time - 8:15AM. 

I decided to adjust my original plan and sit in the car a bit longer since it was cold out and I figured I could only needed 5 mins to pickup by bib and then 20 to warmup. Started walking over to bib pickup at 8:30 and was getting hype. The vibe was amazing, so many cheery people bustling to get to the start line on a chilly Thanksgiving morning. I got to the bib pickup tent and I could not believe my eyes. There were about 15 lines and they were all 30+ people long. THIS WOULD TAKE FOREVER. How are this many people doing same-day bib pickup? 

I begrudgingly joined the line at 8:40 and was nervous about fitting in my warmup now, but I knew it was essential. The line was so slow, and I stood there helplessly watching the time tick by.

It was 37 degrees (F) and I was dressed for racing -  not prepared to stand around. At one point, the lady in front of me in line even turned around and asked, ""Aren't you cold?""

 At 9AM, they called for all sub 25 runners to start lining up and I was only about halfway through the line. Nerves are building. Next came the 10 second countdown at 9:14:50. I was now about 8 people away from the bib pickup table. There goes my opportunity to start with the fast group. It was now 9:15, and I hadn't even warmed up!  Finally, got my bib at 9:30AM - what a f nightmare! I decided that I could still do my warmup since I already missed the start, and most fast runners were almost finished. I took an easy jog down to the Washington Monument, took some pics, and did some strides on the way back - I really enjoyed this. 

6:25 pace felt hard during strides and now I was getting in my head. What I didn't anticipate in my plan, was that the start line would close. I got back to the start line right at 9:45 - when it was scheduled to close. I was literally one of the last people let in, and then they started dismantling the start area. 
What a crazy race morning, and next up was attempting a sub-20 5k!

### Race
I went out hot, I felt a bit uneasy being in no man's land and surrounded by walkers or people pushing the strollers. I was so late that I didn't even have to do much weaving on mile 1 and came through in 6:15! This gave me a rush of confidence as I still felt strong at this point. I told myself that I could ease off on mile 2 a and still get sub-20. Well, at this point I actually starting hitting some crowding and started having to weave a lot more. I almost came to a full stop at one point because of a wall of walkers. 

It's always really tough on me mentally when I have to stop during a race and restart at race pace. I came through mile 2 in 6:28. At this point, I started feeling it, my dashboard was starting to light up, but I knew it should hurt now and I needed to keep pushing. 

A bit of backstory is that I ran this race in 2019 with zero training and the end of mile 2 is where I stalled and needed to run/walk to the end with a 29:xx finish. I was hurting now and started having flashbacks to that race. Everything within my wanted to stop now, but I was determined to prove that I could conquer my old self and run all the way to the finish. 

I was now in the thick of the crowd and still weaving. It was a straight shot to the finish, and I decided to move to the far left to avoid anymore weaving. It was now do or die, I knew sub-20 was in the cards if I could just keep my legs turning over. I started pumping arms and breathing heavily. The crowd support was really good at the point and gave me the final push. Made it!! 19:43


### Post-race
I immediately grabbed a water and walked to the finish area. A random couple asked me to take a pic of them, which was perfect because I definitely wanted a pic and my post-race photographer (wife) was not there. 

My wife was sneakily tracking me on Garmin and texted a few mins after I finished, to ask how it went (how cute). I could not stop smiling. I went to pick up my race shirt and started driving back to the hotel to get ready for Thanksgiving festivities. I knew I was going to be exhausted for the rest of the day, but it was so worth it!

### Background
I started running in 2018 at the age of 28 with the Zombies, Run couch to 5k program, then “graduated” to the regular Zombies, Run app. When Covid hit, me and a couple others decided to sign up and start training for a half marathon that was supposed to be in September 2020. That got canceled, but we still ran the distance together. My time was 2:04.

Since then I have been inconsistently running, but this past summer my wife and I decided to sign up for the Long Island State Parks summer run series to get back into it. The series consists of mostly 5ks with a few longer runs and a horrible 1 mile beach run where half of it is on loose sand. After that I decided to sign up for the Pelham Half since it’s local, fit with my training schedule and seemed like a good first official half.


### Training
I decided to use the 12 week Hal Higdon [novice 2 plan](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-2-half-marathon/), which is mostly about mileage. On a typical week I would run 3-5 miles Monday-Wednesday and then do my long run on Friday. I also rock climbed in the gym and occasionally outside around 3 days per week. I fortunately didn’t get sick or hurt, so I completed every training run. 

The plan calls for a 5k race in week 6 and a 10k race in week 9. I didn’t sign up for actual races, but I did try to run at a 5/10k race pace. I ended up setting my PR in the 5k at a 7:58/mile pace and a PR in the 10k at a 8:44/mile pace. At this point I was pretty confident in the sub 2 hour half marathon goal. 

A big motivation for training was weight loss. I’m a 5’10” male who was pushing 190 lbs and I was pretty down about it. My main source of fun is rock climbing, which is easier when you aren’t gaining weight. Also buying bigger pants sucks. So while training I also decided to focus on losing weight with a target weight of 165 lbs. I used the MyFitnessPal app to track my calories and lost 25 pounds over 4 months! I am now the lightest I’ve been since college. 

I didn’t drink a lot of alcohol to begin with, but I drink way less now (maybe 1 per week). The added benefit of this is that even drinking 2 beers has started giving me headaches over the last few years, so no more of those. I also don’t eat nearly as much dessert as I used to. But also, tracking calories trained me to learn how much food I actually need to be full, and to be okay with being hungry if I have an hour until my next meal. I wasn’t very religious about the tracker after the first 6 weeks or so because I knew in general how much I should be eating.

I noticed as training went on, my resting heart rate dropped into the low/mid 50’s and my running heart rate also dropped. I imagine this happened from a combination of getting in better shape, weight loss and the weather cooling down. It meant that I could run faster at a comfortable pace.

I enjoyed this training block, but got worried as the race got closer because my legs felt so dead. The taper corresponded with Thanksgiving week though, which was awesome. Built in carbo-loading plus my parents visiting meant it was easy to stop thinking about running so much.

### Pre-race
I woke up at 5am, ate a bagel and a banana and my wife and I drove 1 hour to Pelham to pick up our bibs at 6:30. We met up with my cousin there, who signed up to run the corresponding 10k with my wife. 

It was cold, with temps hovering right around freezing. I knew I’d warm up as the race went on so I went with a long sleeve tech shirt with a short sleeve shirt over it, a beanie, thin gloves and shorts. I’m terrible about stretching and warming up, so I just jumped around a bit to get hyped. It was a fairly small race (361 finishers), so I lined up close to the front.

### Race
My plan was to start at an 8:55/mile pace and drop down to 8:45/mile as the race went on if my body let me. Apparently the stars aligned because mile 2 was the only one where I hit 8:55 and the rest of the miles were below 8:45.

I used my Apple watch to monitor my pace and realized after mile 1 I was a little too fast so I slowed down in mile 2 to what I wanted. But that felt slow and I was having fun running with the group I was in, so I decided to go a little faster. I figured I could always back off later if I needed to. 

I took off the gloves and hat around mile 3. If I was still too warm I’d pull up my sleeves and put them back down when I got cold again.

Around mile 4 I started to get a small cramp which never happened during training, but it went away as I ran through it.

By mile 10 I started feeling my left hamstring, which had been nagging me a bit in training, but just ran through it. By mile 11 my hips were sore.

The course was really fun. It was hilly but not soul-crushing. Mile 12 was gently downhill and I felt like I would be able to finish strong. 

The last half mile began with a hill and I thought they were going to be cruel and make the finish completely uphill. But the final 0.2 miles were actually downhill! My wife and cousin found two separate spots to cheer for me near the end, which gave me a huge boost. When I saw the finish as I crested the hill I got surprisingly emotional as I realized I had done it. I realized I still had energy and sprinted across the finish line, almost barrelling over the person trying to hand me my finisher’s medal.

I ended up squeezing into the top half of finishers for my age group and my gender, which I am thrilled by. During the summer races I was consistently between the second and bottom third.

### Post-race
We picked up our bags, took some pictures and walked to a nearby diner for some food. My friend made an impromptu trip to visit us so we met up with him and hung out, then I collapsed on the couch. My legs were sore for about 4 days afterwards. My first run back was yesterday. It was an easy 4 miles and felt great. I signed up for my next half in April. It’s called the [Baker’s Dozen half](https://www.adventuresignup.com/Race/NY/Kerhonkson/BakersDozenHalfMarathon) and is put on by a Donut shop. It’s a (mild) trail half that runs around where we like to go climbing, so I can’t wait!

1676,1701617495.0,Recommendations for 50ks in May-June?,"As per the title, I'm looking for suggestions for a 50k race in the May-June time frame.  I'm open to anything in the continental U.S.  My priorities are, in this order:

1. It would be awesome to have a 5k or 10k that my husband can run while I do the 50k
2. Good race snacks at the aid stations
3. Not crazy hilly.  I'm fine with some elevation, but I'd like to avoid these races that throw in as much vert as possible just cuz
4. Nice scenery, and/or other fun things to do in the town

Because I am an idiot, or a masochist, or maybe both, I'm going to be running the Shamrock marathon in mid-March while my husband does the 8k, and I'm hoping to turn around to do a 50k in the next few months.  This means that mid-to-late May would be preferable to early May.  The Thelma and Louise race is on my radar, but I'd love other suggestions to check out.  Thanks in advance!

1677,1701611078.0,Race Report - St Judes Marathon,"Where : Memphis Tennessee.

What : Full 26.2. They also have a half, 10 amd 5.

Time : 4:38 (PR) no walking besides water stops.

Summary 

This was my second marathon. I ran CIM last year (4:48). I loved both races. They are very very different. CIM runs you early through lightly populated rolling hills on your fresh legs and tempts you to wear them out. Then the end is flats through the city with that city energy. St Jude's front half has a few smallish uphills but mostly is a jaunt through Memphis downtown which i would describe as relatively easy run. Say a 3 or 4 out of 10. Dont think true flat but only a couple steeps that you need to purposefully decide how you run. Lots of people, lots of energy. The run through the hospital at 10 is a beautiful tear jerker. The people and the energy where great. I ran the full but the half is most definitely an A+ half. My two friends who ran with me have 20 something marathons under their belts between them and they agree.

The second half of St Jude is good but not like the first. It felt like 70% of folks veered off for the half split. They changed the full this year to do one loop of the big park rather than 2. I believe that is better. The park is pretty but i would not want to double loop it. They ran us looping through neighborhoods of Memphis with a fair amount of turning. Then the mentioned park with is noticable hills (nothing crazy but you know they are happening for sure)

I was holding about 4:34 pace through the park. Right after the park is a needle where you run out one side of the road and run back the other. It is not my favorite as it felt like late in the race I was not getting anywhere. Then the last 3 miles have more hills. Nothing crazy steep but concentrated. Overall the last 7 miles are the toughest miles. Plan for a race that finishes tough. My goal was to stick with the 4:35 pacers through 20... i made 22. I knew i was running above my pace goal of 4:40 (no 4:40 pacer). But i was hoping my legs might hold as they were doing very well at 21. But those last 4 miles began to seize my legs enough I actually worried about DNF up through 25.5. There is a hill at 25.8 that i went and cheered people through after i finished. Its hard on the soul. I bumped up to 11:30 ish pace for this last 4 mile jaunt and thank god the last 0.2 are a down sloped victory pose run.

Couple more points...

Schwag : solid. I raised 250+ so i got 2 shirts not one. Our day turned out warm but they had heat blankets (thin metal things) for the finish line. We also got a hat and of course a medal.

Water : great. water stops with Gatorade and water every 1.5 at least and individuals added many extras including rad pickle juice.

Accessibility : surprisingly this was a ding. My friend ran as a guide for an MS person. They did not seem to have a proper setup for guide running. The finish area was also quite difficult for his girlfriend (also MS) to maneuver.",running

### Background
I’m a 53 y/o M, 5’11”, 177 lbs. Prior to 3 months ago, I’d only ever run a mile on a treadmill, and I did not enjoy it. I then visited my doctor who drew a bunch of labs, and they were all horrible. They showed on was on track for all the bad things: diabetes, cholesterol, kidney disease, and more. I then decided to start eating better and to exericise. I had been lifting weights for a few years which made me look good, but apparently it didn’t do much more than that.

### Equipment 
Nike Invincible 3 shoes. WorkOutDoors on AppleWatch. Personal playlist on Spotify of songs at 168-173 BPM. Flipbelt for my phone.

### Training
Nike Run Club 5k plan for the last 6 weeks. My usual was to run a 10-min mile, occasionally faster but never under a 9’ mile sustained pace. I’d been practicing keeping up my cadence over 160 aiming for 170. 180 feels way too fast for me. I also have been practicing the form that Coach Bennett recommends in his NRC guided runs. I got up to week 4 of the training plan and then while doing a three-mile run developed left knee pain mid-run. It was mild so I pushed through. I then ran two miles the next day (with mild pain after the first mile). And two miles again the next day with the same pain. I decided to take three days off running to let me recover. (I had been taking 1-2 recovery days per week prior to this.) After resting three days, I ran 3 miles (this was 9 days ago) and by mile 2 my left knee was killing me and my left ankle was aching. I pushed through the pain and finished the 3rd mile at a pace of 12-minute mile. I was devastated that I’d only been running for a few months and that my running “career” may have come to an end before it even started. I’d already purchased non-refundable entry to the San Antonio Rock ’n’ Roll 5k which was then 9 days away. I got in to a physical therapist (who I saw 3 days ago). She evaluated me and found only some mild pronation while running. She recommended arch supports or stability shoes. She encouraged me to try the 5k but to stop running if I hurt. I then went to FleetFeet, got analyzed, and got Currex RunPro moderate arch support inserts to replace the native inserts. I walked inserts yesterday to picked up my bib and determined that the supports were actually causing me knee pain which had been absent for the last week.

### Pre-race
I ate an oatmeal cookie and drank C4. Took Motrin and Tylenol to ward off knee pain. 

### Race
Because this was my first race, it was all foreign to me. It was cold, and I wasn’t dressed for it. I was in corral 5. (I learned what a corral is yesterday when I got my bib.) At 7:30 am, corral 1 took off. I was nervous and excited. My knee didn’t ache at all. I was wearing everything I normally wear while running. Didn’t do anything different. Thank you all for advising that. My corral took off at 7:35 am, iirc, and I tapped start on my WorkOutDoors app. (My AirPod Pros were already playing my playlist with full noise cancelling; I like to block out the world while running.) Within 10 seconds, my first surprise. I was having to push past everyone! They were barely moving. And the road was so narrow and crowded. My watch reads out my pace every minute. “Pace: 12’ 30”. For every 50 people I passed, only 1 person was passing me. I tried to not bump people. So many people were walking. A dad with a stroller was stopped in the center of the road. Towards the end of the first mile, it finally opened up and I could freely run. At that point, I was routinely hearing “pace: 9’….” I kept expecting my knee to ache. But it didn’t. I kept my cadence over 160 the whole time. The further I ran, the more it opened up. I was still passing 20 people for every 1 person that passed me. As I hit the 3-mile mark, my watch showed I’d been running for 29:14. My previous best 5k (just running around the neighborhood) was just under 33 minutes. I could see the finish line. I wondered if I had any chance of finishing in less than 30 minutes, a feat I had never even considered possible. I would have been happy to just finish the race without walking. I kicked it into high gear looking like a lunatic as sprinted the last 200 meters. Later, my watch showed that as I crossed the finish line, my pace was 4’17”. I was running so fast, that I didn’t come to a stop until I was at the chute. 

### Post-race
I then walked around the park until my mental state returned to normal. I was noticing that people were wearing medals. It looked like everyone had one, so they weren’t just for the winners. I asked someone where they got them, and he told me that they were handed out at the finish line. I walked back up the chute and through the finish area. My first pass through there at near black-out speed, I’d failed to notice the snacks, water and medals. I then got my medal and a banana. I walked home. (I live just five minutes from the race site.) I then looked at the app, and it showed my race time was 29:54. I cried. 

### Lesson-learned
If I do another 5k, see if I can get in an earlier corral. I don’t know if that’s possible, but it was awkward to push past so many people. — Also, Motrin works.",running

## Background

Hometown marathon! 

I got into running a long time ago, and right when I did I got shipped off to Spain. I loved my time overseas and used marathons as an excuse to travel all across Europe. I did as many big cities as I could, and I absolutely loved seeing how different and unique they all were. When I got back stateside I signed up for Seattle right away, and used it as a chance to finally go back home and see family I  haven't seen in 8+ years. 

## Training

I ran my first ultra (Washington DC) at the end of October, so there wasn't much training to be had. Took a week off, did two weeks of slow recovery runs, and a taper the week of. My longest run was a 12 miler the weekend before the race to make sure my legs were still in good shape, and that was that!

## Pre-race

I stayed with my sister and her family across the bay from Seattle, and we all took the ferry across to the expo the day after Thanksgiving. The weather was some of the most beautiful Seattle weather I've ever seen, and both the ferry and Seattle were absolutely perfect. I was a bit surprised how small the expo was—marathons in major cities are usually enormous. But a marathon at the end of November apparently isn't as appealing. It was nevertheless a great expo. My little nieces loved the poster station and the free cowbells, and the staff was great. Very well organized and pickup was a breeze.

My sister and her family really wanted to come watch my run, so we woke up at 4am and drove around the Puget Sound to the starting line. I was a bit disappointed that Seattle didn't do any public transit to the starting line. No shuttle busses, no early light rail, no early ferries. It makes sense now with it being a smaller marathon, but the uncertainty around parking and driving in Seattle made me pretty anxious. Big shout-out to my brother-in-law for dropping me at the starting line and taking that stress off my plate. I'm curious to see how other runners handled the parking situation.

As always I judge the quality of a marathon heavily on the bathroom situation at the starting line. I'm a nervous pee-er and that's the worst quality to have while fully hydrated right before a marathon. But the porta-potties were plentiful and there were zero lines. Being a smaller marathon and staggering the start of the half/full probably helped, but I'm still slightly mystified how empty they were. Unicorn race in that regard, top marks.

## Race

I cannot stress this enough: the marathon weather was the absolute best weather imaginable. Chilly without being freezing, beautiful sunrise, cloudless skies, atmospheric morning fog that cleared out for gorgeous vistas at the end... absolutely perfect. Genuinely great running.

The beginning of the race through pre-dawn downtown Seattle was beautiful. The only bad part of the course was mile 2-4 which went through the I-5 expressway tunnels. Running without a view/atmosphere is a bit of a drag. But after the tunnel the course was phenomenal. A bit icy and slippery because of the cold, gravel/trails for parts of it, and a lot of elevation changes. So I wouldn't recommend it for a PR, but as an experience I HIGHLY recommend it. I've been to Seattle a bunch and was picturing a marathon through downtown. But almost 0 of the marathon was downtown and instead went through parts of Seattle I'd never seen and I really enjoyed it. The crowds were great, the weather was great, the views were great. The start/finish at the Space Needle was special too. The last few miles you can see the Needle in the distance peaking above the horizon, which was really cool and motivational. 

The only negative was where the marathon joined with the half marathon (mile 12-16). There was a big pace mismatch and the paths weren't wide enough to really support everyone comfortably. I felt bad for zipping in-between and cutting off the half-marathoners. I think it's bad for full marathoners trying to hit a certain pace, and bad for the halfers who were pretty pooped and just trying to push through. Same goes for the loop around Green Lake which had recreational runners/walkers on the path. Not great for anyone trying to run a PR or hit a goal. I ran the race slow/relaxed so it didn't frustrate me much but anyone designing a marathon course should definitely keep in mind to merge half/full in locations where their paces are similar.

Side note: I really enjoyed the hills. I felt they were the perfect grade and perfectly spaced during the race to keep my legs stretched/fresh. I liked climbing them much more than having to run down them. I have nice long legs and love having to push up a hill to break up the cruise control pace my legs get locked into on flat ground. Great fit.

This was the first race I've ever had with family/friends attending, and my sister moved around Seattle to cheer me on at multiple points. I have no idea how they managed travel/parking around Seattle faster than I could run, but I'm sincerely impressed and it was incredibly touching to have the support. I've always enjoyed the isolation of marathons; being completely on your own to accomplish a challenging goal. But knowing you have people watching and excited for you certainly has its merits and I will never forget the experience or the hugs from my nieces at the finish line.

## Post-race

Post race I felt great. I ran a pretty slow relaxed pace and my legs still felt fresh afterwards. I didn't spend much time in the finish area but it's always great to finish in a stadium filled with cheering crowds.

For anyone looking for the perfect combo of a small marathon in a big city, Seattle is it. I can't imagine the weather will be perfect every year, but I really really enjoyed it. It felt like a refreshing change from the crowded marathons I've done recently. This was the big city experience without any tradeoffs. Great experience

Awhile back I started recording marathons. It's cool to have mementos of a run to watch and enjoy after, especially when you might have been too exhausted to notice everything. GoPros aren't great in the dark so the first part of my video turned out to be a blurry mess, but the rest turned out great! Hope someone else can watch it and remember the thrill and excitement of the run. Congrats to everyone else who finished!",running

How the heck do you keep the training schedule?


When I'm training for a goal race, you bet I can keep my exact schedule for the months required (trained for a 100M this year). And generally I love exercising of any kind and therefore don't schedule my off season. 



But I'd like to make specific progress over the winter so I can start my training season in a better position than I was last year (DNFd two 100M attempts this year, though I'd like to blame the thunder, lightning, hail, and tornado warnings for those DNFs instead of my training hahah).



How do you keep the schedule year round? Sticking with a schedule seems to remove all joy for exercise for me.


And in case it's important - my off season changes goals/focuses enough to be considered an ""off season""",running
1688,1701456676.0,"Injured in my ""comeback"" half-marathon, but the story has a happy ending","**Backstory**

This summer, I started running again after a 5-year hiatus following 2 surgeries (2018 and 2019) to remove a Haglund's Deformity and accessory soleus that had been bothering me for over 10 years. In the beginning, I was cautious running once a week, but I quickly progressed to running more frequently and for longer distances. For those 5 years recovering from surgery I had come to terms that I may never run again and I was overjoyed with my current ability. I set a goal to run a half marathon in under 2 hours again; something I had only achieved once 6 years ago.

**Event: Lewis-Clark Half-Marathon, Clarkston, ID, October 14th, 2023**

***Training***

My training consisted of 3 runs a week. Two 2-mile runs during the week and a longer run (6-10 miles on Saturday).  Ideally, I would have ran more; however, I still didn't completely trust my ankle to hold up through the entirety of training. 

***Race***

The Lewis-Clark Half Marathon was a small event (79 runners) put on by the Seaport Striders of Clarkston/Lewiston ID that was an out-and-back on the Greenbelt Trail. The weather was around 50 F and there was hardy any wind (aka perfect conditions). The trail is a paved path through parks and along the Snake River that has minimum hills. I ran the race with my girlfriend who had been running with me all summer. My goal for the race was to run 9 min/mile to achieve my sub 2-hour goal. 

*Miles 1-9*

This was my first organized race in 5 years and I forgot how quickly everyone runs off the line. I used my watch to settle into a pace that felt comfortable for me. I hit the first mile in 8:54 and felt great! 

Side note, it was around this time that I realized why so many people were booking it off the line as there was a 5K that started at the same time and those runners were now doubling back.

The next 8 miles felt just like the first. 8:54, 8:46, 8:41, 8:40, 8:38, 8:30, 8:27, 8:34.

At this point, I was so confident I was going to break 2 hours and I started thinking I had a chance to run faster than the 1:53:08 I ran in 2017!

*Mile 10*

This mile started just like the others. I felt great, my HR was under control, my breathing felt fine and I was enjoying the process more than anything. As we were approaching the 10-mile sign, I felt a strain in my left calf (surgery leg) and I immediately stopped running. I spent 30 or so seconds trying to stretch to see if it would improve; however, it didn't. My girlfriend stopped to check on me but I told her to go on and finish without me. She ended up finishing in 1:52:39 (her first ever half-marathon)!

*Miles 11-13.1*

As you can imagine, I was devastated. I had put so much pressure on myself to finish this half-marathon in under 2 hours and, not only was I not going to achieve that, I was now injured and feeling sorry for myself. I ended up walking the last 3 miles and finished in 2:20:20.

***The Redemption***

While I was disappointed in the race, there were some positives I tried to focus on. I had ran 10 miles at close to 1:53 half-marathon pace and the ankle pain I had been feeling with for 5-years post surgery was very minimal. Furthermore, I knew that calf strains heal pretty fast and that with some targeted strengthening and recovery, I could be back to running again soon.

Sure enough, my calf started feeling better within a week and I was back to running. It healed up so well, that I decided to take another crack at my half-marathon goal a month later

***Event 2: Bill Chipman Half-Marathon Classic, Pullman, WA, November 11, 2023***

***Race***

This wasn't an official event and there were only 2-participants (me and my girlfriend) but it turned out to be my favorite race ever. The plan was to run an out and back on the Bill Chipman paved trail that connects Pullman, WA and Moscow, ID. Unfortunately my girlfriend wasn't feeling the best that day, so we ran at different paces.

While sub-2 hours was the goal, I knew I was fit enough to run much faster. As I started the run I was almost in a trance. I joked with my girlfriend that I was chasing my ""white-whale"" and I couldn't move on until I reached this goal. 

Unlike the wonderful conditions we had at the Lewis-Clark half-marathon, conditions this day were not ideal. There were constant 15 mph winds with gusts above 30. It was 35-40 F and at one point it started raining. But it didn't matter, I was so determined.

*Miles 1-10*

Like previously, I used my watch to settle into pace and for the next 10 miles I just clipped off consistent miles.

8:34, 8:39, 8:28, 8:29, 8:32, 8:35, 8:28, 8:27, 8:22, 8:20

I was feeling great at this point, but it was still in the back of my mind that I felt great last time and injuries can happen at any moment.

*Miles 11-13*

As soon as I passed mile 10 I breathed a small sigh of relief. I had made it farther than before (lol). I was feeling great but was hyper focused on keeping form.

8:20, 8:24, 8:23

*Last 0.14 miles*

As I approached the finish and I was still running normally it finally hit me. I was going to do this. As I stopped my watch and looked at the time a huge wave of emotion came over me. I had f&%@!\* done it.

13.14 miles in 1:51:12.

I had achieved something I thought was impossible for me after 5 long long long years of recovery.

I was so happy, I immediately turned around and started heading back up the trail so I could run the last part of the trail with my girlfriend as she finished up.

***Currently***

Since this ""race"" I have been running 30-35 miles per week with no problems. Everything feels great and I am grateful to be doing something I enjoy so much. I have a marathon in my sights for 2024.",running

I'm in the hunt for a pair of shorts that are quite short (the classic split shorts) but with an inner tight where to carry the phone.

Training  
Immediately following the 2023 Pittsburgh Half Marathon, I transitioned into fat loss (156lbs to 145lbs) in order to compete in a bodybuilding show at the end of June. During this time, I was walking a lot but only running 1-2x a week for 5 miles.  Immediately following that event, I did a 5-week prep period for a powerlifting meet in July. Also during July, I participated in the summer version of GRIT which helped me have volume pr for the month of right around 186 miles ran. I think that month helped build a good base for my marathon training block.  
  
My marathon training block consisted of 4 runs a week. 2 easy runs of about 5 miles pushing my daughter in the stroller, one speed workout, and one long run. I did not follow a set plan but scaled up my long runs over time and worked in some higher pace intervals on the long runs. I topped out at 2- 18s and 2 – 20 milers. Weekly mileage was between 25-43 miles. On top of the running, I was lifting powerlifting style 4x a week which included, squatting and deadlifting 2x a week.  
Pre-race  
I carb loaded per Featherstone Nutrition guide, 550-600g of carbs for the three days leading up to the race. I had my now routine meal of spicy tuna roll sushi the night before (this has now occurred 3x so its definitely “a thing” now). I’m not superstitious, but I am a little stitious (or I like the comfort of routine and I know my body tolerates that meal well). We stayed over with family nearby so we could get to City Island faster and I got there with plenty of time to pick up my bib, warm up, and take my last gel/electrolytes.  
  
Race  
For those unfamiliar with the Harrisburg Marathon, it is a double loop course that goes across 3 bridges, up and down Front St that runs along the Susquehanna, around a PennDot Building, and 2 U-Turn turnarounds. The half marathon and 4 person relay were run concurrently.  
  
Miles 1-6  
Pretty unremarkable start, it was smooth sailing, hit water and gels as planned. I set out to run 1:37:30 for the first half as my strategy was pick a pace that I thought would be relatively comfy for the first 18-20 miles and give me a shot at 3:15 if the stars aligned. A month prior I ran the Reading Half Marathon in 1:33:30 and felt like I left some in the tank so that also guided my race strategy. I had set out to run sub 3:30 at the beginning of the block but recent runs had me set a super stretch goal of 3:15.   
  
Miles 7 -13.1  
Still smooth sailing. Came in the halfway mark right where I wanted to be. Still was feeling pretty good and manageable.  
Miles 13.1-23  
Right around mile 14, I started to feel my legs grow really heavy. I was very thrown off by this because I figured this wouldn’t happen for another 4-5 miles. My miles started to creep past the 7:30 mark and I entered Pain Cave territory earlier than expected. I kept to my fueling plan and worked to gut it out.   
Miles 23-26.2  
“This.  F------.  Sucks”. The pain cave was in full-effect and I was definitely not having fun here. I knew that sub 3:15 was definitely out of the cards and felt that sub 3:20 was as well. I passed my wife at one point and also passed a group of three young women who had one of those signs about marathoners being crazy or stupid or both… I don’t really remember but I definitely told them that “This.  F-------.  Sucks as I passed them. They laughed and I felt better for about 100 feet. It was right after passing them and having that fleeting moment of feeling better that I decided that I was not going to hard charge the end as I wanted to preserve my body to a degree and thought that even with a 1000% effort, that sub 3:20 was not going to happen. I crossed the finish line at 3:21:XX gun time.   
  
Post-race/Reflection  
I waited over 2 weeks from race day to write this report because of mixed emotions. I ran the Philadelphia Marathon (my first) last year in 4:02:04. I PR’ed the marathon by a huge margin of over 41 mins the following year. I am very happy with the margin of improvement but wasn’t as happy and truthfully, still am not super happy with it like I have been with my other races. This was my first major race that I didn’t get the “race day magic” effect that I’ve enjoyed previously. I have agonized over what went wrong or what I could’ve done better too much. I physically recovered really well and am back to base building for future races but mentally I am still working on it. I am very Type A and control as many variables as possible so at Mile 14 when I felt worse than I thought I should’ve, I think that I became my own worst enemy because it stopped being fun for me around that point when usually, I enjoy (or at least partially enjoy) the races I do from start to finish.   
I had selected Harrisburg because it was better for my family (2 babies under 14 months), but I probably won’t run it again. Crowd support was sparse and I really missed that boost from the atmosphere compared to races in bigger cities. If there wasn’t a relay, then there would have been under 100 people spectating outside the start/finish area.   
  
I have already signed up for the 2024 Philadelphia Marathon. Seeing a lot of my friends run the half or full the following week was torturous and the FOMO was killer. I am still deciding on which race in Pittsburgh I want to do but I am very excited to race there again the first weekend of May and I highly recommend it! I am excited to continue to train and improve and will be increasing my volume and focus on running as my main goal for 2024 is to BQ.

*\*rounded to nearest minute*

**Training**

It was my first marathon. Did a lot of base building in first few weeks and incorporated speed workouts. Mileage peaked in the mid 40s and probably averaged somewhere in the mid 30s during the training block. Not as high as I would've wanted but dealt with injuries near where I was supposed to peak. That said, I had a lot of quality work in with some solid workout sessions. Did an 18 miler (on a hilly course) easy probably nearly 1.5 months out where I had a lot left in the tank after at a pace that was already around my B goal so had a lot of confidence from that. Fast forward, injuries mentioned above reared its ugly head and I had to stop running almost completely for a week or so about a month out before the marathon. Felt better with the rest and tried to ease back into it and was good for about a week before I got sick (!) and shut me down again. Was able to do the ""long runs"" during that time but my HR was elevated. And still is, though to a much lesser extent, at time of writing this. Ultimately don't know how that affected me day of but TL;DR is that first 3/4 of training block were as good as could be for a newb outside of some minor aches and pains and last 1/4 was hell-ish.

**Pre-race**

Didn't really do anything in particular. I rested the night before and carb loaded the days leading up. The only thing I was mindful about was hydrating. I drank a lot more water than usual because I'm usually bad about it even during the summer. I'll mention in race section but the reason for the collapse was cramps. I'm still trying to figure out if all this extra water messed up my sodium levels. Would be easy to blame it on that. But also could've just aimed too high for my fitness level. Race day morning - no breakfast because I usually don't but did have some gummy snacks. No stretching before the race either. Typing all this out, I can see the multiple reasons why this day may have gone wrong for me. Lol. And there are more you'll see if you're still reading.

**Race**

*Miles 1-3*

Plan was to start out conservatively. My watch was severely under so I kept trying to compensate until I realized I wasn't the one that was wrong. I wasn't too worried about pacing. I spent the first 3 miles trying to get my earphones/Apple Music to work and wasted a lot of energy fidgeting. Gave up until I got it to work eventually later on. What not to do - I was actually on Youtube googling songs because for some reason that worked but not Apple Music.

*Miles 4-6*

This was a blur to me and I remember nothing. I was probably trying to run my goal pace while looking for songs on Youtube like I said above.

*Miles 7-8*

My music started, I got into a groove, and found a man and a woman, who were running the same pace as me. We didn't speak but I think there was a mutual understanding we were all kind of following and tailing each other. It was at this time that I realized I hadn't taken any of my gels (was planning every 4 miles). Face palm.

*Miles 9-13*

Our little trio was still sticking around. Even with all the chaos in Brooklyn, especially after drink stations and getting lost when the course would get narrow, we'd always end up right near each other. I would deliberately slow down if one fell behind and they would subsequently catch up and push the pace. Not sure if it was all in my head but did seem like we were all working together. Otherwise I was definitely just being a creep waiting for and chasing them down.

*Miles 14-17*

Beginning of the troubles. Slowly felt myself cramping right before the Queensboro and had to first stop to stretch right when we got off. A couple ran up to me and used a massage gun. It didn't help for long but I am eternally grateful.

*Miles 18-23*

I was walking and had no choice. Would try to run but would cramp after a few steps. This is where all the negotiations started in my head. I think at this point, after a good first half, I only needed to run something like 11 minute miles and I still could've hit sub 4. Realized even that wasn't happening and was tough to not feel sorry for myself.

A well intentioned spectator around Harlem tried to force me to run when he saw me walk. I told him I was cramping and that it wasn't because I was being lazy. He grabbed my arm and gave a push, which only made me seize up more with the movement. If you were him, I would like to say f\*ck you but also thanks for the love because that did remind me to keep checking in with myself to see if I could run. People gave bananas, water, snacks, and I took every single thing I thought would help.

*Miles 24-26*

Was able to get back into a jog. Right before this point, I wasn't sure I was going to even hit 4:30. When I got the cramps under control, I just booked it to try to get the best time I could. Ended up running my goal pace for that last mile. Saw my friends in Central Park South.

**Post-race**

Longest walk out of CP everrrr. I was super disappointed with myself, which is why it took a while to write this report. But ultimately, it was such a cool day and a fun experience. I want to document the good and the bad and we all only get one first marathon and this is mine. Not sure what my running future looks like, but I'm excited to figure that out and being a part of this community.",running

### Training

M42, I did a 18/70 Pfitz training block over the summer to prepare for my “A” race, the Portland Marathon in early October.  I hit my goal there with a 2:58 and I figured that I could recover and then do some maintenance runs to complete the Seattle Marathon.  It’s my hometown race but inconveniently timed, the Sunday after Thanksgiving so I’ve never done it.  I was much more relaxed about my diet and preparation for this race and thought I would just do it as a fun run.  I am posting the race report because there were few recent reviews of the Seattle Marathon online when I was contemplating signing up.

The TL:DR is that the course is really tough, very significant climbs in the last half and near the end.  The organization and on course support good.  The weather was very good this year but caused the course to be slick in some places due to frost.  This isn’t a marathon I would pick for my first or to BQ/PR but if you want a late-season race, I recommend it.

### Pre-race

Did not do my usual prep for a marathon and it ended up showing in the race.  Went out for drinks with friends on Monday, on my feet all day on Thanksgiving making the meal, went to the Seahawks game that night, out for zoo lights on Saturday.
The morning of the race, I got up and had my usual pre-race breakfast with coffee and some Gatorade.  My wife drove me down to the Seattle Center at 6am and I was early-ish.  It started to fill up later, around 6:30.  It was nice that that pre-race staging area was indoors and had real bathrooms.  Bag drop was quick and there was water/hot cocoa/cider if you wanted them.  The only complaint was that there was no announcement for folks to head to the start line.  I headed out at 6:45am to walk to the start line and got there as they were doing the anthem.

### Race

*Miles 1-5*

My plan was to start with the 3:05 pace group and assess at mile 6-8.  If I felt good, start pushing up toward 3hrs and if I wasn’t feeling it, fall back to 3:10.  I really didn’t have any idea where I would be at because I felt like I had 1-2 minutes in hand when I hit 2:58 in PDX but I hadn’t done any MP runs since and this course is much tougher.

The pace groups where totally messed up off the start line.  The 3:05 pacers were pushing into the 3hr pacers.  I think that the 3hr pacers took the first mile really slow but my GPS wasn’t accurate because of the buildings in the city.  I ended up feeling good and pushing out ahead of the 3hr pace group because I didn’t want to mess with the mushed up pack.

I hit the 4 mile marker at exactly 28mins on my watch so either the marker was well off or 3 hr pace group was very slow to start.
The run through the city is kind of cool, down 5th avenue, but you turn on to the express lanes of the freeway at about mile 2 and then are on the freeway for a couple of miles.

*Mile 5-9*

The run through UW and the Arboretum required a couple of sharp turns, descents, and short climbs.  This was the first point since the start where there was any real crowd support.  The fog had burned off, the sun was really up, and the weather was crisp and cool. 

I also encountered the first of the frosty/icy pavement that would be a problem in a couple of areas of the course.  It was right around 32 degrees when the race started and I am not sure it got to 40 by the time I finished.  The pavement was frosty on the UW campus and I felt like my vaporflies had no traction.  I didn’t feel like I was going to fall but I wouldn’t have been comfortable making a turn and I had a lot of slippage on toe off.

We looped through the campus but didn’t really pass most of the prettiest parts. The 3 hr pace group caught me right before Rainier Vista and I fell in with them.  I felt like their pacing was a little inconsistent relative to other pace groups I’ve run with.  It would slow down and then be a sprint, not a steady 6:50 mile.  Some of that is because of the hilliness of the course but some of it was also inconsistency.

I think it would have been very hard if I had been targeting a particular time.  My GPS was off from the start in the city and the mile markers were inconsistent.  They were just sandwich boards and I caught maybe 6 or 7  on the course.  I don’t know if that was because I missed them or they weren’t there but there were long stretches where I didn’t see them.

*9-14*

We made the turn out of the arboretum to Interlaken at mile 9.  This is on my regular long run route so I am very familiar with the slow, undulating climb.  I don’t usually take it at a 6:50 pace but it is a beautiful morning run through the fallen leaves.  The top of the hill was a different story.  They must not have been able to get a permit to close Harvard, Boylston, or Eastlake, which would have been the logical course.  They had us turn and take a much too steep hill.  People were putting the breaks on hard to go down this hill it was just way to steep to run.   It was a killer to expend the energy to go up Interlaken and then get no advantage or recovery as you given up that elevation.

We crossed the University Bridge and got on the Burke-Gillimen trial.  We ran into the middle of half-marathoner pack that had started 30min after us and skipped the Arboretum and Interlaken loop.  It was really hard to navigate the half marathoners.  The Burke is ~8-10ft wide, enough for 4-5 people, but my experience is that the slower half marathoners typically form pretty wide packs so the 3 hr pace group was squeezed down to single file.  Most marathon/half-marathons share some parts of the course and I wish there was a norm for slower runners to stick right and leave half the road to the passing runners.

There is a loop through Gas Works where the crowd support was very strong.

*14-26*

This is where the course got hard.  I knew by gas works that I didn’t have it in me to hang with the 3 hr group for the whole race so I started to let them go.    Mile 14 is the 1st of 3 really hard climbs in the last half.  You have to climb a steep surface street to high 99 that climbs to the top of Phinney ridge.  I wasn’t the only one that fell out of the 3 hr pace group on that climb.  After you get to the top, you drop into Green Lake to do two loops.  This was the other area of the course that I really had trouble with footing in the shady areas of the bike path on the outer loop.  Interestingly, they didn’t close down any part of Green lake so you were navigating walkers and other runners on the inner loop portion.   This was another area of concentrated crowd support.
At the end of two loops on Green Lake, the 3:05 pace group caught me.  I was doing 7:30 miles and not pushing it so I let them pass me but I was surprised at how small the group was.  I started with them and there were at least 25 or 30.  By mile 20, it was down to 4 people and the pacers.    After Green Lake, you are back on the Highway with the 2nd long climb, followed by a nice long descent to your last climb on the other side of the Aurora Bridge around mile 24.

I didn’t realize it at the time but my pace went off a cliff after mile 23.  I didn’t take my usual number of gels because the cold made them more viscous and I just couldn’t stomach them.  I think my nutrition failed around here and I just didn’t notice because I wasn’t pushing for a time.

Took the Denny entrance as an exit and turned to Seattle Center and finish.

### Post-race

The exhibit center was open post-race.  It was pretty typical of most post-race areas but indoor so a little more crowded.  The line to pick up your bag was longer than I had encountered in other races.  They had massage, stretching, and acupuncture available for free which was nice and something I haven’t seen elsewhere.

\### Training  
Background: Currently 40 yo male, high school athletics including track (sprint/400 runner), nothing in college. Remained active during 20s and 30s with gym but really limited endurance training. My wife and I started running in 2019 with a goal of finishing a half marathon together (she beat me). We both enjoyed the experience so much that we had multiple destination runs planned for 2020. Of course, then the pandemic occurred, nearly everything was cancelled (including our vacation plans) and my running fell off to nearly non-existent levels. After a neighbor and friend gave some encouraging recommendations I thought it would be nice to train for the same half-marathon I'd completed in 2019 with a goal of claiming bragging rights in the household. I finished a half marathon in the Fall of 2022 (my wife still holding bragging rights by about 20 seconds) and decided that if I was ever going to actually run a marathon (which sounded insane) I should not lose my fitness and just continued training. I ran my first marathon in March of 2023 following a hybrid Hal Higdon Novice/Intermediate plan and finished sub-4. I was pleased with that result but had been on a pace for sub 3:30 before ""bonking"" for the final 10k and running much slower splits. I recovered for about a month, still running regularly and built my base up to about 40 miles per week figuring I still had aerobic endurance to build to avoid the next ""bonk"".

For the Philadelphia Marathon I decided to go with the 18 week Daniels 2Q program. My work schedule allows for plenty of weekend time and I also have Thursday where I can work from home with a flexible schedule. I decided to perform my two quality runs per week on Sundays and Thursdays. For those not familiar with Daniels, his quality sessions are typically 13-17 miles with a mixture of easy pace, marathon pace, tempo pace and interval pace mixed in during the long runs. All other sessions were ""easy pace"" typically between 8-9 minutes/mile.

June average 41.7 miles per week  
July average 45.1 mi/week  
August 29.2 mi/week  
September 29.9 mi/week  
October 58.7 mi/week

As you can see, I eased my way from my base of 40 miles per week but had some significant setbacks in the middle of the training cycle(August and September) including a diagnosis of two viral infections (including COVID) and one that developed into a bacterial pneumonia. I tried to run through the head cold symptoms when possible, but my quality sessions suffered with the deep lung infections and fatigue. Some days I thought it was better for me to skip my early morning (5 AM runs) and get a bit more sleep which significantly reduced my mileage for about 6 weeks. I could tell my fitness reduced by quite a bit during this time. By the time I was back to feeling""normal"" I only had about 7 weeks left before the race. I felt my goal of sub 3:10 (Boston Qualifier) was out the window and I contemplated not even running the race. Eventually I decided to adjust my goals as even a sub 3:20 would be a 30 minute PR.

I completed out my training with some hard runs and was able to run a 17 mile long run with 14 miles at 7:20 pace about a month out. I felt pretty tired at the end of that run and wasn't sure if I ""raced"" that training run. Uncertainty about what I could actually do on race day lingered throughout those final 7 weeks.

Gear (for those interested):  
I ran all my training runs and the race with a Garmin Fenix 7.   
I follow r/RunningShoeGeeks and had amassed quite a few shoes. My base training was run primarily in Triumph 19s and 20s, occasionally Novablast 2. My quality sessions were run in a combination of Adidas Prime X OG, Vaporfly 2 (shoes I ran my first marathon in that are a half size too small at the marathon distance), and a couple quality sessions in my Adios Pro 3 which ended up being my race shoes.

Gear for the race was racing half tights, running singlet with arm sleeves, merino headband, merino gloves, Adios Pro 3 shoes and a throw away polyester/spandex top.  
\### Pre-race  
Flew out to Philadelphia on Thursday. We stayed in Downtown and explored the area including museums and a variety of food establishments. I carb loaded with a goal of about 500 grams/day of carbs for 3 days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday). I did not carb load nearly as much prior to my first race in March, but I bonked hard and so decided I should ""trust the experts"". I found this part of the prep very difficult and uncomfortable.

Since we were in a new area and I was accompanied by my wife, I probably put too many miles in the days leading up to the race averaging 5-10 miles of walking per day on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. I recognized that all of those hours training for the past year was hard and so this was basically our victory lap. In the future I'll plan to leave time after the race for the sightseeing.

I had pretty bad sleep most of the week prior to the race but had a decent night sleep on Friday which I was thankful for. Saturday night I went to bed around 8:30 PM with a planned 5 AM alarm. My watch said I got decent sleep but it felt shallow and I awakened feeling a bit tired. I ate a dry bagel and downed a Gatorade. Hopped on the transport bus outside my hotel, talking with a newly made ""race buddy"" who had traveled from NYC for the race. We waited in line through security which took about 30 minutes. I found my VIP tent (yes I paid up for that), used the port-o-john, checked my bag, took my first Maurten 160 gel immediately before leaving the tent and made it to my carousel about 3 minutes before the race started. 

\### Race  
The plan for the race was to start out at around 7:30-7:40 pace for the first 10k to take it slow. Since my goal finish time had changed from 3:10:00 to 3:20:00 I was happy with sitting in the back of my carousel, between the 3:10 pacer and 3:20 pacer who was in the carousel behind me. The initial mile running up to the courthouse is quite breathtaking. Definitely a great way to start with a ton of crowd support. I had planned to run with my ear buds in as I'm used to listening to podcasts/books while I run. I intentionally decided to start it at the beginning so I could take it all in. I ended up running the entire thing without ear buds and allowed myself to enjoy the atmosphere which ended up being a great decision in my opinion. My wife was stationed at mile 1 and 6 it was good to see her so early on in the race. I gave her my overshirt at mile 6 and ran the rest in the singlet and arm sleeves.

Miles 1-7  
The goal was slow and steady, see how everything is feeling. In retrospect I may have started off a bit slow as this was very easy but I had a goal of even to negative split and to actually not bonk. Since I knew Boston Qualifier was not going to happen I was happy letting people pass me. There were some areas of the race that did not have a lot of crowd support but mile 1-6 were pretty great especially coming back through downtown between mile 5-7. I took my first ""race"" Maurten 100 gel at 4 miles. My plan was to take a Maurten every 4 miles and take liquid electrolyte hydration provided at every stop that was possible along the race. 

Mile 7-13  
This is the ""hilly"" part of the race. Where I live, there are plenty of hills so I felt pretty comfortable. I did try to pick up the pace on the downhill portion of the race. I did feel a slight tweek in the right hamstring going up one of the hills at around mile 7. Thankfully nothing came of it. This is also the part of the race where you start to get glimpses of people ahead of you as they pass by going the other direction. I always find that part of the race fun and inspirational as you see just how many people who are out there with you. I intentionally picked up the pace during this part of the race, and some of the people who had passed me in miles 1-6 I was already starting to pick off. My half marathon split was 1:37:43. I had taken Maurtens at mile 8 and 12.

Mile 14-20  
This can be kind of a quiet part of the race. The miles kind of just ticked off during this time until you start to get close to Manayunk for the turn around at 20. I kept did start to develop a side stitch around mile 18-19, I think because of all the water I had taken in. I took a Maurten 100 at mile 16 and tried a Maurten 160 at mile 20 but only took about 3/4 of it. Loved the turn around and support through Manayunk and continued to pick off people who were getting gassed.

Final 10k   
I tried to maintain a quick pace. I ended up slowing down for the last mile. I didn't feel too tired in the legs and there was no cramping in the legs. They felt tired but no burning. The side stitch was the hardest part. I'm not sure what to make of that as it had never occurred on my long runs although I had never fueled as much as I did this race. I crossed the finish line and was very happy with finishing strong. Nearly even splits between the first half and second half.  
\### Post-race  
Post-race I grabbed some juice a banana and some apple. The VIP tent had a Bloody Marys so I grabbed one of those as well. Met my wife, gave and received some great hugs and we just hung around. We tried to watch some of the finishers but it was pretty hard to see anything and so we slowly walked the 1-2 miles back to the hotel and changed for a post-race meal. 

In retrospect, I feel like I left a bit of time on the race. Perhaps a 3:10 was possible, but I was happy that the end of the race was so much better compared to my first marathon and I enjoyed being able to pass people to finish it out.

The plan moving forward to to do some additional base building in preparation for a late Spring marathon. I'm not sure how many more miles per week I can add with my work schedule so I might end up maxing out at 50-60 miles per week. As I continue to train and hopefully get faster I'll have to actively work on improving my easy pace so I can be more efficient with the time I have (more miles in the same amount of time).  I hope to add a couple half marathons or 10k locally over the next training cycle and see if I can get a sub 1:30 or 1:25 half marathon. I still have a long term goal of Boston Qualifying and plan on working to achieve that this Spring or next Fall. 

TL;DR  
Ran PR at Philadelphia Marathon and had fun doing it.

**Training**

This was my first half-marathon ever and the farthest I have ever run. I started endurance training in May of this year and have completed a couple of small triathlons before the half. Before starting endurance training in May, I had never played or trained in endurance in my life. The farthest I had ever run before May this year was a 5k that I did when I was 13 and that took me 35 mins. I used an 80/20 plan to complete my first sprint triathlon in early September. Shortly after completing the sprint tri, I started another 80/20 plan for this half. I followed it fairly strictly but definitely missed some workouts here and there. I was running on average 5-6 times per week (about 30-40 miles per week). I tracked everything with my Garmin monitored my data and adjusted training accordingly as I saw my fitness improve.

**Pre-race**

Going into this race was a little intimidating. The farthest race before this that I had completed was a local 8k and my average pace was right at 8 min/mile. This was the week after my sprint tri in early September, so a ways before the bulk of my half-training. I wasn't really sure what pace to go for in the half. I knew when I signed up months ago, that my main goal was to finish in under 2 hrs. I realized about a month ago, that goal was going to be fairly easy for me to hit. As the race got closer, I still wasn't sure what pace I thought I could hold. My Garmin predicted I could run a 1:53:00, but I wasn't very confident I could hit that. So I thought putting myself at a goal of 1:55:00 was reasonable but would still be a challenge. So going into the race I was looking at maintaining an average pace of 8:45 min/mile. I was going to do 8:50 for miles 0-3, 8:45 for miles 3-8, and the fastest pace I felt I could hold for miles 8-13.1.

**Race**

As you can see from my time, I ended up absolutely crushing my ""far-reach"" goal of sub 1:53:00. I was feeling really good the entire race yet still felt I was pushing myself. My splits are absolutely ridiculous and not consistent at all, lol. As the race went on, I realized it was best to ditch my goal of 8:45 min/mile average and just go with how I was feeling, and I was feeling good. I absolutely underestimated my capabilities and was genuinely shocked by how much better I performed than I thought I could (also than what my Garmin was predicting. Garmin is now predicting I can run a 1:51:55 half... after I recorded a much better run than that on the watch, haha). The course was flat for the most part with some very slight uphills at the end which did add a challenge. Luckily for me, I had caught up to a friend at about mile 8 and we pushed each other to the end and finished together, which I think really helped my time. You can see my last 6 splits were pretty quick compared to the others.

**Final Thoughts**

I had a blast. Already signed up for a full in March 2024. Will take a week off before I begin training for the full, but looking forward to it! I will definitely try to pace better and be more consistent on the next race, but happy I went with how I felt because I would've probably finished 10 minutes slower if I had stuck with my original plan!

Quick acknowledgement of the times. These times are from my Apple watch (series 7) I quickly noticed that there was a discrepancy between when my watch said I hit a mile and when I hit the marker on the course. The first mile marker I hit on the course came about 45 seconds after my watch said I hit the mile. The gap continued to get shorter until the 6th mile marker, which again was much different than what my watch showed, so not sure what the issue was. According to the chip timer my pace was 10:45 with a 1:06:42 time. My watch had pace of 10:12 with a 1:03:35. That last time is unknown because I didn't stop it when I crossed the line and the 10k mark on my watch wasn't at the line.

**Training** So this was my second 10k. My first was the Wicked 10K last month in Va Beach. I had started running at the end of August, beginning of Sept. because my MD told me I was overweight. (5'9"" 212lbs at the time). I didn't take that well and started running. After logging about 70 miles in September, I decided I needed a goal and registered for the Raleigh half marathon (next Saturday Dec. 2nd). I logged 104 miles in October and I also figured I needed a warm up race so did the Wicked 10k. It was nice and flat, and I chip timed at 1:18:18 with a pace of 12:37. After that race I felt I needed another warm up and we were going to be in the Augusta area for Thanksgiving so signed up for this one. My training has been for the half Marathon since September, so I switched up my 10 mile day to two weeks ago instead of the week of the race. Since I am still new, it started in September with a run 5 minutes walk 3 schedule and progressed to 6/3-7/2-8/2-9/1-10/1. Not sure where that plan came from, just googled training for half marathon beginner and found that one.

**Pre-race** Nothing special here. Ate really well thanksgiving day. Lots of dressing, potatoes, turkey, green beans, ham, banana pudding, various casseroles (I love food). Friday carb loaded on Sweet potato biscuits with ham. Had to knock out some miles Friday because the week had been hectic. Was able to log some miles Mon and Tue, but traveled on Wed and family on Thursday. The night before attached my bib, got my NB Rebel v3s ready, laid out the rest of my gear.

**Race** The race went really well. Training for the half set me up well for this. The event starts at SRP Park in N. Augusta where a single A affiliate of the Atlanta Braves play. It is a cool event that crosses from S.C. into Georgia and back again. Everyone was really friendly and the morning was about 38F. Got going a little fast and when that first mile vibration hit my watch, I checked and thought there is no way this is right. As stated above passed the actual mile marker not quite a minute later. I was running faster than normal, so I did slow my pace down some. I didn't want to walk at all, if I didn't have to. as we finished mile 2 we were almost back to the park and hit a little hill. I tried the consistent effort method, but ended up having to walk up the hill, about 100 yards. Got to the top, turned right and headed over the bridge across the Savannah river into Georgia. This section was pretty flat, and I had a couple of people that I was pacing off of. As long as I kept them in eye shot, I felt like I was doing alright. Just after the 3.5 mile timer (not sure why it was set up there unless it was more focused on the half-marathoners who had a different initial route but ended up on this section later on) there was another hill. Luckily there was water at the base so I grabbed a cup and walked for the second time. Much smaller hill and only about 30 yards or so. Got to the top and started running again. At this point, I start noticing a few people pass me and my pride kicks in a little bit. I am checking bib colors to make sure it wasn't half marathoners, and it wasn't. Once I hit mile 5 and was headed back across the bridge into S.C., I felt really good and picked up the pace (although the time on my watch didn't reflect that, but I really did pick it up). I see some halfers crossing the bridge into Georgia, so I still felt good about finishing before them (they had a 10 minute head start). The finish of the race was inside SRP park. We entered from the center field wall and it was really cool, running along the outfield track, down the foul line to first base, past home and the finish beside third. As I entered into the field, I noticed that people were starting to make some noise. I thought, maybe I was the first finisher in my age group (50-54) (I wasn't, I was 5th in my age group), so I sped up a bit. Then people were getting louder, pumping my ego up even more. Then a young man comes blazing past me somewhere near home plate. Turns out he was the 1st place half marathoner. I tried to keep pace but still finished 2 seconds behind him, to lots of fanfare; because the second place half marathoner was 13 seconds behind me.

**Post-race** Got my medal, hugged and kissed my wife. Hugged our son and granddaughter and we got on the road for the 6 1/2 hour ride back home (stopping at Buc-ee's in Florence, SC which was ridiculously busy on a holiday Saturday). All in all, excited by the improvement and ready for my half this coming weekend. Was really happy with the 11 minute improvement and look forward to attempting to hit sub 1:00:00 at some point.

Training

I started getting into running towards the latter half of July. For reference, I am a 5'10"" Male, 25 years old. I started running at 245 lbs and currently weigh 224 lbs.

I did C25K and then slowly got more and more into running, and decided to do a half. I initially was going to run one in May of 2024, and my brother convinced me that i was able to run this one in November, so I had to prove him right!

I used Hals Novice 1 plan for this race, and only variated slightly. I started a week early so i had an extra long run, and ended up doing 10 miles 3 times before this half. Other than that, the weekday runs were all according to plan. I had no real issues with training, besides getting sick 3 days before the race so i didn't run the week leading up to the race.

&#x200B;

Pre-race

I woke up early and had my normal pre-long run breakfast of a piece of toast with peanut butter, a banana, and honey. My family drove me to the race, and my brother (who ran with me (he is a beast and runs fulls, he was pacing me)) encouraged me to hang with the 10:40 pace group. This had me a bit nervous as i did most of my long runs around a 10:45 and was really scared to go out too hard lol.

&#x200B;

Race

The race itself was absolutely perfect. It took a few miles for all of the people to thin out a bit and to get into my groove, but once we hit mile 4 it was smooth cruising. At this point i had my first SIS gel and grabbed water when it was offered. Miles 4-8 were just a blast! Our little group of 10 or so was cruising right along, and the course and weather were just perfect. It was great having my brother to help me along too. At mile 8 I took my second Gel and kept running along no problems, continuing to grab either Gatorade or water at the stations. Once we hit mile 10, I was still feeling really good, so we sped up a bit and left the 2:20 pace group (which had already banked a minute or so as well).

I thought about taking a third gel around 11 but held off, no regrets with that as i was feeling the tiniest bit bloated from all of the liquid. With the help of my brother, we ran some of my fastest miles at the tail end of the half to finish at a time of 2:15:47. I  am blown away at my ability to finish strong, and so far ahead of my, albeit conservative, goal of 2:30

&#x200B;

Post-race 

We got our medals and a donut, and headed back home to enjoy our day!

It is so crazy to think that at the end of July, I couldn't run a mile non stop, and now I have finished my first half and didn't walk at all. I am going to work on continuing to lose weight this winter, and start introducing some interval runs into my weekly schedule, and shoot for a PB half middle of next year! I am totally hooked on running, and am glad I ran this race!

* B Average <328 watts Yes; 336 - 8% improvement BOOM!
* C Pick someone in the final 1/2 miles to catch. Yes, two people in the final 100metres

My highest mileage week was 40 miles which was more than planned as I felt recovered and strong in my strides. Coach put in some lower mileage weeks for the 2x 5km I did, but the reduction was slight, and I recovered fast from 5 km. In the build-up, I also bought a pair of Nike Alphaflys next %2, which I ran in for the SF half in July and helped save my joints and muscles from impact while making up for sloppy technique when I get tired. I am a huge fan of carbon plate shoes - I use Vaporfly for track sessions which I love for shorter distances and fast sessions, while Alphaflys are soreness-saving and reduce my recovery needs with the extra support. I made a few specific intentional switches in this Berkeley training block;

\-I started prioritizing my interval workouts and headed to a track for these. I also used gels and carb drinks and made an effort to get sufficient sleep in the lead-up.

\-I planned the routes for long runs, wore race-day gear to symbolize race day, and tried to get sufficient sleep in the lead-up.

\-I ran with friends and a running group for my easy Z2 recovery runs to stay accountable, meet new people, and make running more social.

\-I did one yoga session a week for mobility, recovery, and flexibility - I did heated yoga as I enjoyed this more.

A tool I find useful is my Stryd Fotpod power meter which helps me keep an even pace, especially on hills. I owe a lot of my ability to split to the fotpod negatively, and if you can afford it, I would highly recommend it. The subscription may even replace a coach for some people. I wear a Garmin 245 watch and a Garmin heart rate monitor, which I sync with the Fotpod to have watts, pace, heart rate, and time while running. Are all these tools necessary? Absolutely not. Are they expensive? Yes, but it is a worthwhile expense, given how much I get out of running. The super shoes are not necessary, nor is a coach. It all depends on what you can do and what you enjoy. I find all of these necessary and worthwhile, and I'm also very lucky and fortunate that these luxuries make sense to me. I probably take running too seriously, which I'm working on, but I'm always open to changing for improvement, e.g., going to the doctor or getting a coach if my way is not working for me.

**Training;**

My training was the best of my two-year running career and my first full block with my run coach Dr. Will O Connor. I started running regularly two years ago during the pandemic and have since done four half marathons; SF half 2x2022,2023 Golden Gate half 1x 2022, Oak Town Half 1x2022. In this training block for Berkeley, I did 2x 5 km. I did my second trial in training on the Kaizer track in SF and finished at 17:42, which pleasantly surprised me and gave me a lot of confidence. Track workouts gave me more confidence than long runs, as long runs had hills, fueling, and long distances, which are bigger challenges for me. Early in 2023, I began to work on running and went to the doctor to get my health checked as I wanted to run mentally, but physically I had no energy and felt stuck in a rut. My blood all came back good, but mentally, I felt depressed and was recommended antidepressants which I decided against. Instead, I knew I could change a few things, so I turned over my training to Dr. Will, and it has been a game changer since then. As I write this, I’m currently just after having my first run after four days off, which is not my style at all, but it's what my coach has recommended and an approach I'm much more at peace with.

Coach put in some lower mileage weeks for the 2x 5km I did, but the reduction was slight, and I recovered fast from 5 km.

**Pre-race**

I got a ride to the race with a friend from the run club, which helped me take myself less seriously and enjoy myself so much more. I got there about an hour early, which I highly recommend; please get to the race at least 30 minutes earlier than you think to get a warm-up, restroom stop x2, and adequately fueling. The temperature was perfect, around 50 Fahrenheit, which boded well. For breakfast, I had 2x25 scoops of oats, one scoot protein, and three scoops of mixed berries with one teaspoon of peanut butter. I also had a small cup of coffee and beetroot sweets. I read that nitrates help improve subjective time to exhaustion, so I tried them for this block. Do they help? I didn't notice a difference; however, I did perform better, so if it makes financial sense, I will use them at least eight weeks out. I hoped to stick with the 1:30 pacers but realistically knew my pace would be closer to 95 than 90. I let the 90 pacers go out of sight, and the 95-minute pacers also went. At one point, the 100-minute pacer caught me on a hill, and that's when I decided to push the downhill as I was definitely going too slow.

&#x200B;

**Race**

Miles 1-4

1	1.00 mi	7:11mi	169 bpm

2	1.00 mi	7:33mi	176 bpm

3	1.00 mi	7:00mi	179 bpm

4	1.00 mi	7:20mi	178 bpm

&#x200B;

I had no idea how hilly the course was, which was frustrating. My game plan was to chill going uphill and push faster downhill. I felt so good in the first mile and am very grateful to have made it to the race with a clear plan and confidence. Once I settled in, I reminded myself to stick to my own race and watts around 330, which went well. I also had a heart rate range of 170-178, which I got right up to by mile 3 or 4. The hills are bad, but as it was early on and I was fresh, I didn't notice how much they slowed me down. However, it's easy to go too hard and blow a lot of energy, so I think my strategy worked well here. I did have Nuun hydration drink from the water station at mile 3, and hydration is something I could have done better throughout; however, I didn't have a full cramp, so I avoided that setback. My first 5k was in 22:26 - my slowest 5km in the Golden Gate half was 21:36, which shows how hilly and conservative I started. It was nice to run the campus initially and see some fans in the city, too, which helped.

&#x200B;

Miles 5-9

5	1.00 mi	7:18mi	181 bpm

6	1.00 mi	6:37mi	179 bpm

7	1.00 mi	6:53mi	182 bpm

8	1.00 mi	7:05mi	183 bpm

9	1.00 mi	6:59mi	185 bpm

&#x200B;

I knew this was a relatively flat section and a chance to push the pace, so I consciously tried to kick on and surge past a few people, not taking advantage of the hills. The section here was nice and relatively enjoyable, although my HR started to climb, which was concerning. Then, I started to focus more on how I felt and trust my body's ability to perform. At around mile 6, I had an SIS gel which I highly recommend as it is half water, so it goes down really easily and comfortably. I also had a 100mg caffeine tab at this time, as I find caffeine improves my performance. My second 5k was slightly faster in 21:48, which again shows how conservative I took it, but a negative split is a huge goal of mine for any race given how Kiptum smashed the WR and increased in speed as he did it that is the gold standard for racing for me. The mid part of the course is relatively uneventful but a nice surface to run on.

&#x200B;

Miles 10-13.2

10	1.00 mi	7:10mi	187 bpm

11	1.00 mi	6:51mi	190 bpm

12	1.00 mi	6:44mi	193 bpm

13	1.00 mi	7:10mi	193 bpm

14	0.32 mi	2:09mi	194 bpm

&#x200B;

I planned to run the final 5km the fastest, following on from what Kiptum did, and I did just that, finishing this 5km in 21:28 despite more of an incline going over the bridge. The bridge was a moderately difficult but short incline, then the turn around by the waterfront was scenic; it was great to see the leaders, but running back into the wind and up the bridge was challenging given how fatigued I felt. Around mile 10, I had my second gel and started to see the 95-minute pacers. I made a big effort to tail the 95-minute pacing group, and on the downhill of the bridge, I decided to surge past the 95 pacer and follow through on my fast 5km plan. I ran too fast, and although I got such a rush of adrenaline by digging deep, it was hard to go slower, and my inexperience and negative splitting showed. By mile 12, I was suffering big time and started to get caught by a few people. I found the second 95-mile pacer and hung onto him for dear life we talked a bit which helped. We turned the final corner and could see the finish, and the pacer said to me kick like you are in a track workout and finish strong. I sprinted as fast as possible and caught three people, which was important for me when finishing. I enjoy giving 110% and finishing knowing I tried my absolute best, which I can say I did.

&#x200B;

**Post-race**

According to Strava, this result was;

Best estimated Half-Marathon effort (1:32:37)

Best estimated 20k effort (1:27:41)

Best estimated 10-mile effort (1:09:26)

Best estimated 15k effort (1:04:39)

Once I crossed the line, I sat in a chair in the medical tent as I was so tired. I was so happy and got a picture with the Pacers, who did a good job. I cannot recommend sticking with pacers for a realistic time enough. I got my challenge medal for finishing the SF and Berkeley half the same year. I got some pictures with club teammates and went back to cheer on a team mate which was great to see other competitors finish. I didn't break 90, which I knew was less than a 5% chance. I didn't hit a 10k PR which I also thought was a small chance of happening; however, to hit an overall PR of 1:34:06 and improve my power output watts by 8% overall is huge. In the SF half on a tougher course, my race average watts were 312 while my Berkeley average was 336, which is great about watts; no matter the course, the watts don't lie, and the pace and heart rate will always vary.

&#x200B;

**Final thoughts;**

I am delighted with the result, and can't wait for the Hot Chocolate 10km in SF in January, the Kaizer half on a fast course in February, and the SF Half again. I would recommend the Berkeely half as it's very well organized and has a great atmosphere; however, it is definitely not a PR course, and the elevation gain was 610 feet, whereas San Jose, Oakland, and the Kaiser half are faster courses. P.S. I no longer feel half as much depression, and running is a huge source of my ability to deal with this.

1756,1700868024.0,After 6 years I think I cured my plantar fasciitis,"I have struggled with PF for a long time and I felt like I have tried everything. After years I think it's finally nearly 100% resolved. I want to share what worked for me. (See bottom for TL;DR)

I'm 32F and have been running for decades. I started running for the first time in high school and did XC and track (2004-2009). In college/grad school I ran off and on just for health, maybe a 5k here and there. Up until that point, I really only ran around 20-25mpw.

In 2016 I started taking my training more seriously and began increasing volume, maybe up to 40mpw. I remember training for and running my first half marathon in vibram five fingers (NOT recommended, but I only got shin splints, nothing serious). Realizing I shouldn't do distance running in minimalist shoes, I switched to Altras. In spring 2017 I ran a 50k trail race. I struggled a bit with shin splints during training but overall training went fairly well and I peaked at 50mpw.

Later in 2017, I went on vacation and spent a lot of time running on the beach. Then I suddenly had severe plantar fasciitis in my left foot. I struggled with it for months after this. I tried running less, stretching, icing, rolling on lacrosse balls, foot strengthening exercises. Compression socks made things worse. Then I began sleeping with a night splint, sometime in early 2018 I believe, it improved significantly, but didn't go away. I was still running in Altras. 

In 2019, I was still having issues with pain in my foot whenever I increased volume or intensity, and I had also developed tendinopathy in my left medial gluteal tendon. At some point, I started developing some PF in my right foot as well, and had to get a second night splint. I was very frustrated and started going to a physical therapist but it was only superficially helpful. Also around this point I went to a podiatrist who recommended I switch back to running shoes with some drop (12-14mm) and getting custom orthotics. He was right, and these changes helped a lot, but still didn't cure my PF.

In 2020 during the pandemic, I was living in a place that had complete lockdowns, so I couldn't even go outside to run for a few months. I started working with an online PT to really focus on my glute and foot issues. He also coached my running once we were allowed out again. My injuries improved in 2020-2021 with mobility, prehab/rehab, and carefully planned increases in mileage and speedwork. One of the things that I believe was hugely helpful was using a mobo board. I was running 40-50mpw and set some new PBs in 5k and 10k. I stopped working with him when I moved in 2021 due to time & financial reasons. 

In 2021, I began experimenting again with wearing barefoot/minimalist shoes to strengthen the muscles in my feet. I have a dog and I generally walk a lot, and I gradually transitioned to only wearing barefoot type shoes in all contexts besides running (these shoes have flexible, minimal soles and a wide toe box). I believe this made a huge impact in strengthening all the little muscles in my feet. If my feet were feeling extra sore one day, I'd wear an old pair of my running shoes that day to give my tired feet a break.

However, I continue to only run in traditional running shoes with my custom orthotics. I found the best results running in Brooks Ghost shoes, sized big and wide so I have LOTS of room for my toes. I am usuall EU size 41-42, but I buy men's size 44 wide. The extra big, extra wide shoes for running also seemed to help a lot in preventing pain and tightness. I will probably never return to running in zero drop or minimalist shoes.

I was mostly running just for health in 2022 and early 2023 due to stress at work & home. But now in late 2023 things have calmed down and I'm ramping up my training again to run my first road marathon in spring. Now I'm now doing yoga or strength training at least 2x/week and working on doing more PT and mobility. Yoga has really strengthened my feet and calves as well as my glutes and hips, also helping with my calf and hip flexibility.  I am finally accepting that if I want to train harder I HAVE to do some activating prehab before every run and incorporate regular mobility work to address my hip/glute weaknesses. If I do this consistently, my glute problems go away. My feet seem really strong, and the PF is pretty much gone (knock on wood!). However, as a prophylactic measure, I still sleep with a night split on my left foot sometimes after heavy training runs. 

I'm really, really grateful that I can still pursue my big running dreams, and I seem to have won my long battle with PF. I would love to hear thoughts and experiences from the community and I hope this helps someone.


Summary (TL;DR):

I believe I developed PF for the following reasons:
- Increasing volume/intensity without a consistent strength & mobility routine 
- running in zero drop shoes despite a long and gradual transition period (they will just never work for me)
- insufficient foot strength due to wearing stiff, narrow shoes for everyday

I believe these are the factors which really made a huge difference for me:
- consistent mobility and prehab exercises (I highly recommend the Mobo board)
- sleeping with a night splint EVERY night (even when traveling)
- running in really big, wide shoes with 12-14mm drop, with custom orthotics (the Brooks Ghost is my fav)
- gradual transitioning to barefoot style shoes (flexible, minimal sole with plenty of toe space) for walks and everything else 
- Yoga 2x/week (or some other form of strength training)",running

1772,1700658903.0,First marathon for Dad and I (eek!),"So I’m a casual runner (F35), typically 2-3 5K runs per week and 10K on a weekend. I’m not religious about it but that’s the general pattern. I’ve gone up to 30K two years ago and know I can get there again.  I have never entered a race in my life.

Dad is also a casual runner, and in pretty good shape, and suggested he wanted to run a marathon before he turns 70. Naturally I’m concerned because in his mid 60s to suddenly choose to run a marathon isn’t a simple feat. 

But… we agreed to sign up for a race together so we have a target date for our training. We have 6 months (early May) and I honestly don’t care if we finish dead last… the thought of crossing that finish line together gives me happy tears. I’m going to run with him as much as I can and encourage him in every way, but I worry because he can be stubborn. 

Have any of you personally, or through a friend/family member set a goal like this but have had to watch for their signs of struggles/injuries?  Being as supportive as possible but also prepared to say at some point, “Ok this isn’t going to work and you’re going to seriously hurt yourself.” without crushing them.  

I want to do this with him, I think he CAN do it, but I also know that he would rather struggle through an injury rather than bench himself for a week or two to recover. 

Your thoughts and guidance are appreciated.

My running peers in my area (Ottawa, Canada) have insisted that the only way to get noticed is via social media in this industry. However, social media mentally affects me too much so not worth it + my sanity and just generally do not enjoy it all. I recently hired a social media manager to do ALL the social media for me as I have no choice as word of mouth is too passive and not working. Financially after a 3 month trial run if I still don't get any clients after taking the risk/plunge; I may have no choice to abandon ship. I anticipate so many hustle-bros and entrepreneurs could easily respond and say ""Oh well, you just didn't want it bad enough"". Okay, ya that's very comforting, thank you; guess I didn't care at all or even tried.........""sarcasm"" cough. I've taken risks, given my time, outsourced/delegated and asked for professional advice.  
  
I have one dedicated client who spreads the word but that's it. Been at it for about a year & a half now.

I am in awe the tremondous risk the big clubs & coaches had to take to be as big as they are. It appears the barrier to entry is low that anyone can call themselves a running coach (similar to Personal Trainers).

### Background
I'm an adult-onset runner: I started racing in my early 40s, started getting serious about it in my mid-40s, and set all my PRs at age 50, with quite a few AG and even Master's podium finishes.  My 50s were unfortunately filled with injuries leading to an osteopaenia diagnosis, but I continued to run and race when I could.  However, the combination of menopause + age-related slow-down and me being at the top of my age group was pretty depressing, so I was determined to get a solid training cycle and a good race in shortly after my 60th birthday in mid-September - I figured that even with a slower time, I had a good chance for an age group win to make me feel like I'd done well.


### Training
I started ramping up my running this summer with no specific race in mind, aiming at the 40-45mpw region, which I held for most of the 12 weeks before the race, not counting taper week.  (In early October we did a MTB vacation in AZ so that dropped my mileage for a couple of weeks and dropped my average to 38mpw, but I was riding instead so not sitting on my butt, at least.)  I asked on this sub for race recommendations, which is how I learned about Berkeley; I picked it partly because I have family in the Bay area and it would make a nice excuse to visit them, and registered at the end of October, 4 weeks before the race. My other reason for choosing this race is that the course plays to my strengths, with rolling hills, cool weather, and a much lower elevation than my training grounds at 6500' in Colorado.

For most of my races, I've created my own plans based on ideas from Brad Hudson's book Run Faster.  I've always done well with relatively high mileage spiced lightly with faster running, though I've found that I can only handle one real workout (not counting hill sprints, strides, surges, and fast finishes) plus a long run per week.  For this reason I've always done track work early in the cycle, and then move to tempo runs late.  A few years ago I met the half marathon 65M WR holder (he lives in the area) and he told me that he and the fast old guys he trains with use a 9-day ""week"", so I decided to give it a try.  I set up my plan with a 3-day minicycle, so every 3 days I would do either a long run, a track workout, or a tempo/cruise interval run, with easy runs on the intervening days, throwing in strides or hill sprints on the day before the workout.

This seemed to work pretty well!  My longest LR was 13M, and I did a couple of 12M; my peak GHMP runs were 6M and 3x2M embedded in 9-10M overall.  In March 2022 I'd run a just-sub-1:44 half, but I knew I wasn't going to be close to that as that had been on a downhill course and my ""GHMP"" this year was a LOT slower.  In fact I had only been able to maintain a tempo pace of about 8:35 - but I hoped that race day magic and my altitude advantage would come through.


### Pre-race
I stayed in the Hotel Shattuck Plaza, which was literally two blocks from the start.  The expo was about 3/4 mile away, which I figured would be a good energizing walk for the day before - except oops, I accidentally brought my sweatpants and a pair of tights to the gear check, rather than sweatpants and jacket, and so I walked back to the hotel to get my jacket, then back to the expo, and then I walked to a friend's house and we walked to a restaurant for dinner, for a total walk of over 7 miles, oops?  

Race day dawned with perfect weather, cold and clear.  I wore shorts and singlet, with a junky long-sleeve t-shirt on top I discarded before the start.   For breakfast I ate an oatmeal cookie washed down with coffee nice and early so that I had time for bodily functions and my pre-run strength + flexibility routine, then I walked over to the start where I took in some water, got rid of some water, and headed for the corrals. 

I had entered 1:45 on my sign-up (rounding down!) and was assigned to corral B, but when I looked for the pace group signs to figure out where to place myself in the crowd, I saw the 2 hour pace group at the FRONT of corral B and realized that I'd better move up!  I spotted the 1:55 pacer way ahead, but there were too many people in front of me for me to move very far forward, so I started the race at nearly the very back of corral A.


### Race
By the time I crossed the timing line, my Garmin told me I was moving at about a 12 minute pace, a bit off my goal :-)  I was actually surprised that I was able to come nearly to pace by the first mile mark considering the density of the crowd. The gradual climb and the crowd around me kept me from pushing too hard early - I'm always amazed how much easier it feels on race day to maintain a pace that felt so hard in training!

Eventually I passed the 1:55 pace group, and as we climbed through the campus on what I think was the steepest part of the course I caught sight of the 1:50 pacers ahead.  I figured that as long as I could keep them in my sight (and as long as they were pacing well) I'd come in under 1:50, since I'd started quite a bit behind them. On the long downhill that started around mile 4.5 I started catching them, and I passed them shortly before the 6 mile mark.  (In fact when I reached for a water cup I think I accidentally cut off one of the pacers who was trying to get the energy gel drink there - sorry!)

I did slow to a walk or jog in order to drink water at every aid station (except the last, which I skipped because it was on the far side of the street from where I was trying to run the tangents).  Still, I felt pretty dehydrated that afternoon and the next day.  For fuel, I had a small tootsie roll in my pocket that I had picked up at the expo, and I ate it around mile 6. (I tend not to eat much during races, not even marathons.)

Looking at the course map ahead of time, I hadn't realized that we had to climb an overpass a little before mile 8, and I felt a bit apprehensive as we approached and I could see people running on it - but for some reason the actual climb didn't feel like much, just a little bump. It was really cool to be running on the overpass and see the leaders coming back from the out-and-back, and I just had to cheer them on! 

The next stretch was super flat and fast, with the wind at my back, and then I ran around the turnaround and boom, right into the wind.  Fortunately I am a small, skinny woman, and there was a nice selection of larger guys ahead of me, so I worked my way up by tucking in behind one, drafting for a while, and then passing him and finding another windblock to draft behind. It wasn't long before we turned back to the east, no longer directly into the wind. It was also nice to get back in the shade of the neighborhood houses.

I had been warned about the final miles being all uphill, but I didn't find it a problem.  Partly this was because of my altitude-enhanced lungs, partly it was because the course had frequent turns at intersections, which resulted in interspersed flat sections and also avoided the demoralizing view of a long uphill ahead.  And partly it was because, I think, I paced pretty well; I was running the same pace in mile 13 that I had in mile 1, except instead of feeling easy and relaxed it was the fastest I could possibly manage!

I crossed the line at 1:49:33 on the clock and 1:48:47 official, which was good enough for the AG win in my new 60-69F age group. (Of course it was sort of silly to have this as a goal, since it depends just as much on who else has showed up, but as I said earlier, it helps with the sting of getting slower.)  My Garmin read 13.21 so decent but not superb tangent running. 

(I found the split info on Athlinks really interesting - at the 4.2 mile split I was in position 628, and 51 people had passed me by the turnaround at 9.2 - but I must have passed about the same number after that as I finished 624th overall, almost in the same position I was at 4.2!)

### Post-race

I chugged the bottle of water handed to me at the finish and then went to get my warm clothes on, which I was very glad of as I drank my free beer (meh pilsner, at least it was local) because the beer-drinking area was in the shade and I was starting to get cold.  I chatted with a few other runners and ate some pretzels, then headed back to my hotel room for a shower and nap before going out for lunch at a noodle place where I got a bowl the size of my head full of noodles, BBQ pork, and bok choy, and ate almost the whole thing.  Then it was time to take BART to go visit my brother and his family. By the time I got back up to my hotel room the DOMS was starting to kick in.

On Monday morning I walked 4 miles around the campus to loosen up my sore legs, which turned out to be a good thing as my flight out of SFO was delayed, resulting in my having to sprint across DIA to catch my connection home ow ow ow. Today my legs actually feel pretty good!

**Background**

&#x200B;

24M, started running halfs my freshman year of college for fun and a way to stay in shape during the summer (2017- 2:43, 2018: 2:12, 2019: 2:27) . COVID hit, I finished school and had endless amounts of time to start diving into running. Haphazardly signed up for the Philly half after my running club convinced me to in September 2021.

At this point, I had trained fairly well, began incorporating speed work every week and felt stronger than I had ever before. I ended up crushing my previous halfs and finally broke 2 that year (ran a 1:56). This gave me all the confidence I needed and decided to run the Philly marathon in '22.The advantages of running with a run club is the support, community & the knowledge that people impart.

The disadvantages for noobs like me are I would train in a similar fashion to those who were much more experienced and weren't running the same race as me. I trained my ass off in '22. I was running longer than I have ever before, and was doing it faster than I ever have. I crushed my 1/2 marathon PR again and ran a 1:46 at Philly Distance Run and had all the confidence in the world that I could break 4 in November '22.

This was the start of a long, painful & honestly depressing period of running. I picked up patellar tendonitis a month before the race, DNSd Philly & started from scratch in January '23. After multiple PT sessions, I knew I had to work on strength training & form. And thats exactly what I did. Spanish squats, RDLs & the 175 metronome on Spotify were my best friends.

I managed to take my cadence from an avg of 155 to 175 over the span of 3 months. This brings me to Spring of '23 and I was getting ready to begin my block. I was in great shape, hitting the gym regularly, running 25mpw & felt great. There's your extremely unnecessary and very long background :)

&#x200B;

**Training**

&#x200B;

After overtraining and building my own plan last year, I knew I needed some help. Aaron, someone from my running club (s/o Fast Tracks) was looking to getting into coaching & I was ready to be his lab rat! He built a plan & would check in with me after every run and really is the reason I was able to do this race.

We started the 'base' of my block in June, with most of my weeks looking like this

:Mon- Lift

Tues- Easy 4-5 w 6-8 strides

Wed- Quality session (Threshold paces, built up to 3mile intervals and then did a bunch of 800s & 400s at the later end of the block)

Thurs- Rest

Fri- Easy 3-5

Sat- Long run

Sun- Rest

At first, I felt like I was doing less than I could given how most of my miles were easy. I would look forward to my quality work every week so I could push myself. As we progressed through the block and the mileage increased, I quickly understood why. The best part about this whole block is training alongside my dad who was also running his first marathon. Watching him be as active as his and giving everything he had into the training really motivated me to get out there.I peaked at 43 miles for 2 weeks, my longest run being a 20miler (3hrs10mins).

I skipped a couple long runs with travel, had to split up a few into 2 days and cut my mileage significantly for the last 10 days before my 2 week taper (tweaked my soleus).

I felt decent going into the taper, definitely knew my legs would be fresh but most importantly I knew injury free. This is when I would obsessively check the weather, read every race report I could find so I could plan my race to the minute details. 

&#x200B;

**Pre-race**

&#x200B;

Woke up at 3 (without an alarm!) after going to bed at 8- chugged a bottle of water and went back to sleep till 4. Stretched, foam rolled and made my 2 PBJs so I could eat em on the drive over. A 30min drive, 10min wait for security check & a porta potty stop later- we made it to the corral. We couldn't have asked for better weather this year. I was scarred after last years 20mph winds while I was volunteering- so the 35degree sunny day had me elated.

&#x200B;

**Race**

&#x200B;

Started out extremely slow, we made a plan to hit the first 5k in 29-30mins and then pick it up to 9:15s from there. I did just that, clocking in the first 5k at 30:55. From here, I diligently took my gels every 4 miles and hit every hydration stop to drink water or nuun.

Running through the city is my favorite part about the philly races, the crowd support is great and something about running through your home city is a special, special feeling.I was in cruise control at this point, soaking in the energy and hitting splits between 9-9:15. I got to the minor hill at Drexel and tapped into my dragon powers and navigated up 34th and over to the zoo with ease. I was really looking forward to the 10 mile water stop since our club hosts it and once I got there my next milestone was the turn on to Kelly Dr.

This is where I knew I messed up. I could feel the build up of lactic acids in my legs and knew I couldn't sustain the pace I was at nor could I kick into that gear I planned on. I had to make a change. I began walking the water steps and kept telling myself I needed to get to the turnaround at Manayunk to see my friend.Finally made it to Manayunk and the energy was PHENOMENAL. I almost felt like I was riding the Tour the way the crowd took up the streets. I saw my friend and knew at that point I needed to whatever was necessary to finish.

My run-walk back up plan was in progress.With every tremble up my quads. I would slow to a halt and walk 30-45 seconds before starting to run again. At this point, mile 22- the 4:10 pacers caught up to me and all hell broke loose. I kept telling myself I couldve avoided this if I had stuck with them from mile 9. Seeing my watch creep up to the dreaded 4hr mark, I made every calculation I could to figure out what I needed to do to finish sub 430.

I somehow made it to boathouse row and told myself this was it. Seeing the build up of the crowds, the anticipation to see my friends and the sight of the finish line did it for me. I zoned in and gave everything I had to run it in. First spike of energy came when a few friends surprised me- hugged them and saw more friends. At this point I got my legs back, high fived the crowds on the way to the finish line and couldn't believe I'd done it.

&#x200B;

**Post-race**

&#x200B;

Absorbing the fact that I had just finished and this thing that hung over my head for a year was finally done- a wave of emotion hit me. Seeing my friends afterwards, I really took it all in and fell into their arms. From there, I had a second leg of energy come in with all the excitement of realizing that I ran a marathon! My buddy who ran a 2:42 at Chicago was there and I was just in awe.At this point, I was stoked to see my dad cross the finish line. He had a friend join him at mile 10 and run the course with him. That's the type of friendship I aspire to have at 56 :)From here, I know I'm going to run a marathon again so I could build on what I've learned about myself. Although an IronMan is the ultimate goal, next year will be a mix of swimming & cycling mixed with a fall marathon.Last note on this extremely long race report- this community here, on r/AdvancedRunning & my running club makes this sport special. Having a group to bounce ideas off of, train with & enjoy this beautiful sport makes everything worth it.

1782,1700596692.0,I’m HORRIBLE at pacing myself during a race. Please help me race better!!,"Backstory: I took up running during the pandemic and have been consistent with it for a couple years now. Trained somewhat consistently for a half marathon last year. Wanted sub-2:00 but was not in sub-2:00 shape. Came in at 2:16, but I KNOW I could have done at least sub 2:10 if it weren’t for the fact that I went out wayyyyyyy too fast. I’m talking my first couple miles were MINUTES faster than they needed to be. And the thing is I KNEW not to go out too fast.

I’ve decided I want to run a full marathon next fall, and as part of my year-long build up, I want to get better at racing. I ran a 5k race recently, and while I was content with my time (26:19), I went out too fast again. My last mile was a minute slower than my first…

In both races, the psychological effect of getting passed in the second half really got to me. To the point that I almost quit. I feel like it’s soooooo hard to focus on running my own race when I’m surrounded by people. I’m very competitive by nature, so I think this is the hardest part for me.

Aside from tips on how to overcome this psychological aspect of racing, I’m curious how I should go about pacing myself? I listened to music during my half marathon but didn’t have my watch telling me my splits. During the 5k, I listened to music and had my watch set to tell me my pace at each mile. I literally thought I was going soooooo slow the first mile (seriously thought it was in the 10 minute range), so when my watch said “8:03”, I was SHOCKED.

My questions are:

Do you recommend listening to music while racing? I find that music can help hard effort feel easier, but it can also keep me from being in tune with my bodily cues of how hard I’m going.

Do you recommend tracking your pace or just going by feel? If going by pace, how do you decide what pace to go at? What if it feels “wrong” during the race? How often do you check your pace?

I have a 5 mile race on Thanksgiving, and I’m determined to do it right! My goal is sub-45, and I’m trying to decide on music or no music and if/how often to check my pace. Would ideally like to run the first mile or two a little over a 9:00 pace and then speed up gradually in the last three.

All advice appreciated! Racing just feels so different from my training runs and speed work where it’s just me. I’m also wanting to run another half marathon in the spring.

Thanks!

Update:

I did it!! Thanks so much for all the suggestions!

Splits were 9:29, 9:15, 9:25, 9:19, and 8:49

Not sub-45, BUT I did NOT account for the fact that the race had 300 feet of elevation gain 😅 I’m visiting my family in Tennessee and am used to fairly-flat Wisconsin lol. (For context, the 5k where I PRed, my elevation gain was 7 ft lol)

I used the Apple Workout app to alert me if my pace dipped below 9:20 or above 9:00. Figured I would try to run the first two miles in that range and then pick up the pace if I felt like I could later in the race. Also set the app to alert me if my heart rate crept into zone 5. The hills definitely kept me from speeding up, but I felt like I had a bit of a push in me the last mile, especially as I had been trailing someone most of the race and really wanted to pass them. Not my fastest race, but this felt good and strong. And looking at my heart rate data, I think I was right where I needed to be. Started at the very back of the pack and did not listen to music. I think both those things kept me from going out too fast! Got an alert about a quarter mile in that my pace was above the range I indicated, so I definitely would have gone too fast without the alerts.

Overall, I feel like this was great practice for pacing a race in general. Will see how things go for the half marathon in the spring and then full marathon in the fall 😎",running

### Background
I haven't been a runner for too long - about 2.5 years. From 2015 to 2019, I'd do my company's annual 5k in the fall, with barely any training, and would get slower each year (31:26 -> 35:35). Then, in the winter of 2020, I tore my ACL skiing, and in the spring of 2021, after being on the treadmill in PT, I vaguely set the goal of ""getting back to being able to do a 30ish minute 5k with no/minimal training"", and started running more regularly, at first on the treadmill at the gym, and then with local running groups. 

Running with local groups escalated quickly into PR'ing the company 5k in the fall of 2021 (25:56); running my first half marathon (2:09:xx) and Broad Street in the spring of 2022; and a fall 2022 training cycle that started with an initial goal race of a metric marathon (26.2k, 16.28 miles), included another 5k PR (24:17), and ended with running the Philly marathon (4:17:50). I signed up for this year's Philly marathon the next day, I suppose mostly because I had a very good experience overall with both training and running it, although it was freezing cold that day. This spring I broke 2 in the half (1:57:xx) having done more way skiing than running, and that made me think that maybe I had a chance at sub 4 for the marathon if I ""actually trained"".

### Training
It might be worth noting here that I've never really followed an actual training plan outside of hitting mileage goals. When training for my first half, I was working with a coach from one of my running groups, but I irritated my left hamstring around the time I was supposed to be starting to do actual workouts vs just ""x miles easy"" (my ACL surgery was a hamstring autograft, and it seems to get irritated when I ""overdo it"", where ""overdo it"" means go for a walk of any distance on the same day as a long run) - so at that point we shifted to focusing on mileage only. For the metric marathon and Philly marathon in 2022, my only goal was to ""finish at a comfortable pace"", so I didn't worry about incorporating workouts into training. Last year, that worked out pretty well - I ran a half marathon PR during the metric marathon, and during the full I finished the first half in 2:05:50 (2nd best half at the time) & the second half in 2:12:00, and felt decent the whole time, from what I can remember.

This year, I planned to get 20-25% more mileage than last year, as well as trying to do one day a week where I'd alternate between ""speed"" and ""hills"", although I didn't totally succeed at that. I did attempt to loosely follow an online plan I'd seen for a 4 hour marathon, although that was more so in terms of intended mileage than anything else. Last year my mileage peaked at 33 miles, with a 20 mile long run, and my average/median for the 16 weeks up to and including the race was 22-23 miles. This year my mileage peaked at 35 miles with a 20 mile long run, and my average/median for the 16 weeks leading up to the race was 25-27 miles; I'd intended to peak closer to 40 miles and average closer to 30. I intended to run 4-5 days a week instead of 3, but I still usually only ran 3 days, with a few weeks of running 4 days - and I only kind of succeeded at the ""speed"" and ""hills"" idea. 

Almost all of my long runs felt like crap and were 1 min/mi or more slower this year vs last, which I mostly chalked up to this fall being a lot warmer (it genuinely was 15-20 degrees hotter and I do NOT deal with heat well) - but potentially this was pointing to other issues either with general nutrition, training load, stress, or some combination. I ran a half in 1:56:xx in mid September, at which point I figured sub 4 was unrealistic but a PR was still within reach, but after that point, all my long runs that had felt *amazing* last year (aka why I even signed up for Philly in 2022 at all) were feeling terrible, so I really wasn't sure what to expect, although I was still hoping for a PR. My Garmin seemed to think I could finish in 4:09:xx, and its other predictions for shorter races seem realistic to me, so I chose to believe it was right about the marathon too (or at least that if it was wrong, I would still be under my 4:17:50 PR)

### Pre-race
I ate the same dinner the night before this year's race as last year's - garlic butter chicken from Honeygrow (why mess with what worked before). I went to bed around 10pm and woke up at 4am, got ready, and left my house by about 5am. My boyfriend kindly drove me down, and I ate some Greek yogurt and about 2/3 of a Nature Valley granola bar in the car - he dropped me off and I went through security at about 5:50. I had brought water bottles to fill my hydration vest since the pre-race email said you couldn't have your vest filled, so once through security I filled that, then dropped off my bag at gear check, stopped in the warming tent for a bit, used the port-a-potties, and after that went to my corral. I had a throwaway fleece zip up that I tossed shortly before the start.

### Race
The first half of the race felt great! I dressed more or less the same as I had for the Love Run in March, which had been slightly warmer than marathon day this year (mid to high 40s in March, vs high 30s to low 50s), so I thought I would be comfortable the whole time. It was also basically the same as what I'd worn for the marathon last year (low 30s with 15mph winds), minus ear warmer and gloves: long sleeve Columbia omni heat shirt, full leggings, hydration vest, sunglasses. 

You could maybe argue that I started out too fast, although from miles 4-10 or so I was chatting with a random woman from North Carolina and overall felt relaxed & fine. I enjoyed pointing out some of the sights to her, especially since I barely remembered taking note of them myself last year (hence the ""enjoy it more"" goal - I felt last year I'd been so focused on finishing, it was all a blur). She was shooting for a faster time and pushed ahead; for another few miles (11-13ish) I was still ahead of the 4:10 pacers. I slowed a bit but not terribly in Fairmount, and by the time we got to Kelly Drive, the 4:10 pacers were ahead of me. At this point (~16 miles) I was also starting to feel a bit warm, and wished I was wearing short sleeves. I kept doing the mental math for whether I would make a Strava PR (4:14:20), chip PR, both, or neither. 

By the 30k timing mat I didn't think I'd hit either, since I was already at 3:01:06, and if I rounded to 8 miles remaining, it would take me 80 minutes at a 10 minute pace, and I was running slower than that. In retrospect, allowing myself to do the mental math might not have been helpful, because it undoubtedly discouraged me from pushing myself more at the hardest points. I ran out of water in my hydration vest around mile 24 (probably because I was too hot), and though I could've stopped for a cup at the final water stop, I figured I'd be fine for the last 2.5 miles (my watch was about .3 mi ahead). I do think being overdressed meant the second half would've been tough regardless of if I'd started slower, so I've told myself that slowing down earlier just would've meant a slower overall finish, though who's to say if that's true.

### Post-race
I got a bottle of water, my medal, my space blanket, and various snacks including a banana and chicken broth, and hobbled over to one of the fountains near the gear check trucks to sit. My boyfriend came and met me; we got my checked bag and slowly made our way back to his car. I probably should've used the bathroom before we left but didn't feel like I really needed to, so we ended up stopping in Manayunk on the way home. 

Last year I signed up before the price increased, so I only paid $85 for this year. My whole experience that time around was so different, and it definitely encouraged me to try to do it again (and, girl math, might as well save $70 by signing up early vs once the price is at its max). This time, although I know there were plenty of things I could do better in the future, I'm left feeling more uncertain of how badly I want to beat my year 1 PR, as well as when I'd want to try to do that - I like to imagine that within the next 5 years I'll get married and have kids, so theoretically it would be easier to do so sooner than later, if I actually want to commit the time to a better and more successful training cycle. Plus, I certainly came away with plenty of things to do differently next time, and though I'm disappointed, it was inevitable that I'd at some point have a race where I didn't set a PR / meet my goals.

### Training
After running a handful of half marathons since the spring of 2022 (including the Philly half last year), I (41, m) decided to register for the Philadelphia Marathon for my first full marathon because I grew up in the Philadelphia area and most of my family still lives in the area. I followed a 16-week training program put together by my running club. It had me running 6 days per week, up to 55 miles at my peak and included 2 20-mile runs and a 22-miler. Since it was my first marathon, my main goal was to finish. I wasn't sure what pace to shoot for, but I hit 1:40:35 in a hilly half marathon in the spring, so I thought that with good training, 3:30 may be in reach.

Training started off well and I only missed a couple days in September due to some Achilles pain that quickly abated with a couple days of rest. I had planned on continuing to do resistance training 2-3 days per week as well to maintain strength, but lifting went out the window as the miles increased and I only had so much time in my day. At the beginning of October, I did something to my ankle. I'm still not sure if it was a sprain or anterior tibial tendonitis. Either way, after a long run, my ankle swelled up and I could barely walk on it for three days. My PT prescribed rest, and I took nearly three weeks off before I could run on it again. I did some stationary biking, but in retrospect I should have paid more attention to my conditioning. I missed peak week and came back in time to do my second 20-miler, but I never again felt as fit as I did at the end of September. To complicate matters, I developed chest congestion and a mild cough at the beginning of November and for some reason my heart rate (both at rest and during exercise) sat about 5-10 bpm higher than before. I decided going into the race that I would start at 8:00 per mile and just see how long I could hold that pace.

### Pre-race
In the days leading up to the race I tried to eat plenty of carbs and stay hydrated, but I didn't do much else out of the ordinary. The day before the race I did an easy three miles and notice my heart rate was still higher than it used to be at the same level of perceived exertion. Saturday afternoon my wife, my daughters and I drove to the Convention Center, picked up my race packet and checked into our hotel. For dinner we ordered sushi and had a picnic on our hotel room floor.

Race day morning I woke up at 4:00 (I didn't sleep well due to nerves) and got out of bed around 4:40. I got coffee from the hotel lobby, ate the untoasted peanut butter bagel I had brought, and caught a shuttle to the start line. The security line was long, but not as long as it had been last year for the half marathon. I checked my track pants and water bottle with gear check, and to in line for a port-a-potty at 6:40. The line moved slowly, and I didn't have to pee too badly so I considered just getting out of line and getting to my corral. I stood there as they played the national anthem, then moved up a bit. I stood there as the wheelchair division started. I stood there as the elites left. Finally, as the next coral was leaving, I got to the porta-john and relieved myself. After that I raced to my coral (Green) which was about to leave.

### Race
Miles 1-2: I made it to the back of my corral with just seconds to spare. Starting at the back of the coral meant that most of my first two miles were spent weaving around runners to try to hit my goal pace. I managed to stay under 8:00 per mile, but all the weaving meant that my Apple Watch was already 0.2 miles ahead of the markers on the course by the time I had finished two miles.

Miles 3-8: I kept my pace through Center City and was feeling good, but I could see that my heart rate was above 170, when I was hoping to keep it in the mid 160s for most of the race. I ran passed my wife and daughters at Mile 6, and tried to give them a quick hug. I felt on-pace as we crossed the Schuylkill. I stuck to my fueling plan of one gel every 3-4 miles and Nuun at every water station.

Miles 8-16: As we hit the downhill on Lansdowne Drive and saw the faster runners coming back up the same way, I realized that my stretch goal of 3:30 was probably out the window since I couldn't see myself maintaining the pace on the uphill coming back. The run through the west side of Fairmont Park was hillier than I anticipated, but I managed to hold an 8-minute pace. I felt myself tiring throughout this portion. I decided that I would hold onto the 8-minute pace at least until I had completed the half marathon. After I finished the half at the 8-minute pace, I decided to push for at least 15 miles at the pace. 15 miles came, and Mile 16 was downhill, so I kept up the pace through Mile 16. After 16 miles I was actually 1 minute ahead of the 8-minute pace. I stuck to my fueling and hydration plan through this stretch too.

Miles 17-21: After Mile 16, I couldn't hold the pace anymore. My new goal became to just keep running and not worry about the pace. My pace dropped quickly to closer to 9:00 per mile. The realization that I had 9 more miles, which could take up to an hour and a half to run, seemed impossible to me. My mind and body told me I just couldn't do it. I kept going, grabbing Nuun and then water since I started to feel extremely parched. I knew the turnaround on the out-and-back was around Mile 20, but it felt like that would never arrive. At some point I thought we had made the turn, but seeing the faster runners on the other side of me snapped me back into reality. For what I had thought would be a flat marathon, this portion felt extremely hilly. Finally at Mile 20 I made the turn and headed back to the finish. Running the same route again, but in reverse, was demoralizing. The sun was beating down, and I felt the same way I did on my worst runs of the summer. My body kept telling me to stop and walk for a few minutes, but I resisted.

Miles 22-25: Finally at Mile 22 I gave in and walked for 30 seconds. It felt glorious. After 30 seconds or so I ran again. For the next three miles I took a good number of 30-60 second walking breaks, especially through water stations, where I would grab Nuun and water. I was angry at myself for giving in and walking, but I also wasn't sure if I physically could have run the whole time. I had planned on taking my final gel at Mile 22, but the thought of more sugar nauseated me so I skipped it.

Miles 25-26.2: I had planned on continuing my walk-run strategy for a bit longer, but at Mile 25 the crowd support increased and I could sense the finish was near. I kept thinking, ""Just run for another minute, then you can walk if you need to."" The cheering and support from the crowd kept me running though, and eventually the finish line was in sight. At Mile 26.57 according to my Apple Watch, I finally crossed the finish line with a time of 3:40:28. 

### Post-race
I got my medal, walked through the food tent where I grabbed a banana, drank more water and more Nuun, then found my family right outside the runners area. I hugged my family and try to process what had just happened. I'm proud of having run a marathon, but I was disappointed in myself for walking. I wished I would have pushed through the pain.

After a walking recovery, we strolled back to our hotel where I showered and changed before we had to check out. We found an Irish pub in the city where I devoured a Shephard's pie (and various appetizers), then got in the car and made the 6-hour drive home.

Having time to reflect on my experience, I'm extremely proud that I have completed a marathon. I'm still a little bit disappointed in myself for walking. If I had to it over again, I would have adjusted to an 8:15 pace earlier in the race in the hopes that I wouldn't hit the wall so early. But I think it's also good that I learned my limits by sticking to the 8:00 pace as long as I could. Part of me wonders what would have happened if my training hadn't been interrupted or if I hadn't had this lingering chest congestion. But in the end, I accomplished what I set out to do: finish my first marathon. I can worry about time goals next time.

I already plan on running the Pittsburgh Marathon in May. This time I'll make my long runs slower, do more speed work and not let my weight training fall by the wayside.

## Training

My (32M) training began last year, in July of 2022. I followed Hal Higdon's Novice 1 and was dedicated and consistent, hitting every run until a string of injuries (IT band mostly) in October forced me to abandon my pursuit of the marathon about 5-6 weeks before race day. I was super disappointed. 

I injured my knee in a soccer game two months later in December, getting diagnosed with acute arthritis in my left knee. I spent 7 months in the gym, 6-7 times per week recovering. I still didn't feel my best as July rolled around and my training plan (Hall Higdon 1 again) was supposed to begin at the end of the month. I gave myself a do-or-die run to see if I could complete miles without pain on Saturday, July 22nd. It was mostly a success so I jumped into the plan.

I hit every mile, every run from Week 3 to Week 18. I learned a lot from last year in regards to taking care of my body pre- and post-running. I'd be foam rolling, stretching, and strengthening almost every single night. I put an extra 1-3 hours of body care into almost every single day, not including the running. It was a big commitment and it took a lot of time. But it worked. My longest training run of 20 miles didn't even feel like my toughest run. 

Going into my taper, I was dealing with some left calf/Achilles pain and some right knee/hamstring/calf pain. Despite that, taper went well and my last week of training felt really triumphant. I was excited and happy to have gotten that far, and feeling ready for Philly. 

## Pre-race

I woke up 15 minutes before my 5am alarm after a night in which I didn't feel like I slept much. Between noises on the street outside and waking up freaking out that I'd missed my Lyft and my plans were ruined, by the time 4:45 rolled around I decided to just get up and get going. Normal pre-run routine consisted of a bagel, coffee, Tailwind, bathroom, music, and gear check. 

I got to the event around 6am. Security was easy and I had an hour to wait before the race began at 7am. I used the bathroom 3 times, stretched and prepped, and generally felt myself sink into my own nervousness. My stomach gnawed on itself. Intrusive thoughts like ""what am I doing here? I don't even want to be here. I don't feel like I can do this, I'm not ready"" invaded my brain and stayed there until the start of the race. I didn't feel great, or excited - not quite dread, but definitely anxious. 

## Race

The Olympians and Elites got started and eventually, my corral started walking toward the line. I started to get excited. I could feel the energy in the runners around me, we were body to body and it felt like we were going to war together. I had some music prepared for this moment and it helped me feel a little more settled, but my heart rate was over 100bpm, normally sub-50 resting. Nerves. 

**Miles 1-4:**  
Feeling and seeing the crowd was really cool. I also saw my girlfriend and my other buddy on the first mile, and it was great to know I had supporters in the crowd, people that I knew and others that I didn't but everybody was cheering me and the other runners on. Despite this, miles 1-4 I was still plagued with doubts. My legs didn't feel like they had a lot of energy in them, and I wondered if I had just gotten a little unlucky in that today was going to be one of those ""meh"" days where my legs didn't feel like doing the work. 

**Miles 4-8:**  
I took Huma gels basically every 4 miles, adding Gu chews at the start of the race, mile 12, and mile 24. These early miles slid by pretty smoothly after my initial doubts. I don't really remember thinking much about them. I saw my girlfriend and pal again in downtown Philly somewhere around mile 6-7. The weather was fantastic, I was starting to enjoy myself a little bit, taking energy from the crowd, waving to people, grateful to be running in pursuit of my goal. 

**Miles 8-12:**  
This is the hilly part of the course, but I don't feel like it bothered me that much. Seeing other runners several miles ahead of me on the parallel parts of the course blew my mind - they were zooming! That was pretty cool. At mile 10 I thought ""I basically have to start a 16mile run right now,"" and wondering if I could complete this huge task. I remember getting to the mile 12, downing some Gu chews and thinking I was just putting fuel into this running machine, my mind was just along for the ride. 

**Miles 12-16:**  
Still in the hillier portion, things started to feel a little more challenging. The crowd in some of these miles was so awesome and encouraging, and I just kept going. 

**Miles 16-20:**  
This is when it got really tough, running along the river. Knowing I was heading for the turnaround in Manayunk, I felt like this part of the course just never ended. It kept going and going and going. The water and Gatorade stations were my tiny reprieves, I couldn't run and drink so I used that time for short rests and to get fluids. By the time I got to the turnaround, I was in some serious pain. I had not felt this kind of pain even on my longest 20 mile training run. On that training run I had felt some tiredness in my legs and some knee stiffness, but on race day my feet hurt, my quads hurt, my hamstrings felt tight, my aches and pains from taper had returned. I just needed to see this through, but I was struggling.

**Miles 20-24:**  
Enter more intrusive thoughts. Temptations to walk for a bit, rest for a bit, maybe stretch. I refused. I was battling against my body, against my mind. I had never been tested like this before. I had prepared a final stretch playlist of some of my best, favorite songs during training that would give me energy and uplift me. I had also prepared some texts to send to people, dedicated these last miles to them. Mile 21 was for the dogs in my life, past and present. Miles 22-24 was for my family. I sent those texts, and listened to those songs, and tried to think of those people that were so special to me, but in general all of those coping mechanisms failed me. All I could think about was finishing the run, how many miles I had left, how many minutes that was, how much pain I was in. I know those songs were playing, but I don't remember listening to them. In the end, I had no crutches, it was just me against this 26.2 mile task. 

**Miles 24-26.2:**  
Mile 25 was dedicated to my girlfriend who was in the crowd a few hundred yards from the end. The last 1.2 miles were for me. My music was playing, I remember entering the last mile and starting to get really emotional, knowing my goal was right there. I laughed and almost-cried at several moments as downtown Philly came into view. The last few hundred yards I ran with my arms up or out, staring up at the sky, I couldn't believe it. As I crossed the finish line I broke down, one of the most emotional, cathartic moments of my entire life. I had been through so much pain and struggle in training leading up to the race, and then knowing how hard the race itself was and how I had persevered and fought through my doubts, everything came crashing down. I went to get my medal and sobbed all over the guy who put it around my neck. He gave me a hug and said ""great job man! you earned it!"" and I kept crying, hands on my head. I'm grateful to that guy. 

## Post-race

I wandered around like a lost soul for a little while until my girlfriend and friend could get through security and into the area. It was really great to see them. I cried again and hugged my girlfriend. I couldn't have done it without her, she had been so supportive over the last 18ish months and was always in my corner encouraging me. We took some photos and I tried to take stock of myself: pain in both feet, both quads, both hamstrings, both hips, and my back. Mentally I felt like a shell of myself.

Back to the bnb, a hot shower, some food, a couple hours laying on the bed reminiscing and reflecting were all nice. We hung out with my friend and his friends that night in Philadelphia before getting back on a flight home late Sunday evening. 

A few days later, I am still so so so sore. I hot tubbed, got a massage, taking motrin, still ridiculously sore. Paying the price. But I did it. I'm proud of myself, but I'm not sure I ever want to do another marathon. Training for it often felt good, some runs were amazing, like a drug, but the race itself was absolutely killer and I am feeling more beaten up than I have since playing college soccer. We'll see how I feel in a few months when it continues to sink in. 

Thanks for reading.

**Training**

I signed up back in mid October on a bit of a whim. I run most days of the week and sprinkle in some 10 mile runs on the weekends. I ran with a group when visiting a friend and went for 14 miles and felt really good. With a bit of coaxing, I signed up for Philadelphia and jumped in at the last 6ish weeks of this training plan:

[https://s3.nikecdn.com/events-platform/pre-prod/NET\_Admin/faq/2016-08-27\_822\_MarathonTrainingPlan.pdf](https://s3.nikecdn.com/events-platform/pre-prod/NET_Admin/faq/2016-08-27_822_MarathonTrainingPlan.pdf)

Training went ok. I was having a lot of stomach issues once I got 10-12 miles into my runs. I've dealt with acid reflux in the past, but mostly manage that fine with Tums. This was more like gas issues, felt deeper in my bowels rather than the mid-chest discomfort I get from acid reflux.

I started modifying my diet a bit and found that a bagel with some honey on it became my go-to breakfast. The harder part was that I also weaned myself off coffee. That seemed to do the trick. I had some reflux and stomach issues towards the end of the run, but Tums knocked out the reflux, and the other issue I think was just from my running pouch being a bit too tight.

**Race**

Pre-Race: I got in a little before 6:00 and managed to get to use a toilet without waiting 50 minutes in line, which was good, but I definitely got pretty cold waiting around for the start. It was maybe 40 degrees before the sunrise. I run on the cold side, so I have leggings on under shorts, a short sleeve under armour shirt, a thin black zip-up jacket, and gloves. A throwaway thermal shirt helped a bit, but I need to remember to keep my space blanket from this race for the next one.

Mile 1-6: This was probably my favorite part of the race. Running downtown and around City Hall gave a lot of great views. Everyone was packed in very closely, and a guy right in front of me nearly wiped out from a pothole. I go back and forth on whether I like running with this amount of people or not. On one hand, I enjoy the plotting of my route through and around people. It's a nice mental distraction from asking why I am doing this to myself. On the other hand, I don't love crowds. It's fun for a mile or so, but then I wish it had spread out a bit more.

My last race was my first marathon. I was excited and so worried about causing stomach issues, that did not do the race nutrition piece well. I had a GU about 11 miles in, and started getting toe cramps at mile 16. So, this time I tried to keep to a schedule of having a GU every five miles. So, Mile 5 I have my first one. Along the way, I hit every water station. I would get at least one water, and one Nuun. I would grab one from the end tables and get off to the side so I could walk or stop to drink. I seem to lack the coordination of jogging and drinking. Unless I learn to drink fluid through my nose, slowing down or stopping to drink is going to be my method.

Mile 7-14: No complaints here. There are still a lot of people, but I had considerably more breathing room. I started the race behind but within site of the 3:40 pace group, which I passed in the first couple miles. Around mile 7 I pass the 3:30 group. It starts to get a little more hilly, but nothing too bad. Training in the Pittsburgh area has completely changed my conditioning for hills. Mile 10 I have another GU. I get a little reflux discomfort around mile 12, so I have two Tums.

Mile 15: The toe cramp. I stop at a fluid station to get water right around mile 15. When I stop to drink, the toes on my left foot cramp. It lasts maybe 10 seconds as I walk through it and start running again. I used to get toe cramps and charley horses 10ish years ago because I didn't properly hydrate day to day. But they were a thing of the past until I ran my first marathon last April. I got a cramp in the same foot around Mile 16, and it killed my pace. I tried upping my hydration and making sure I was snacking during the race. I also switched to the Hoka Clifton over a month before the race, which felt more cushiony than my usual running shoes. Maybe I need more sodium? I did end the race with a lot of crusty white salt sweat on my face. Anway, I have another GU and keep going.

Mile 16-20: I get three more toe cramps in this time, which hampers my pace. I slow down when they start and try not to fight it. The last marathon I tried to almost push down with my foot to work through the cramp. This time, I kind of just let it go. I think it helped because I don't get any more toe cramps after mile 18.

Mile 16 was very cool because I got there in time to see the 1st-3rd place runners heading back in the opposite direction around Mile 24 for them.

This area is nice, though I have used the Schuylkill River Trail from Conshohocken to the Art Museum many times, which runs right along this road. I highly recommend it, though it did make this part of the route feel a bit less special in a way. Right after Mile 20 in Manayunk, we turn around and start the final stretch.

Around mile 19 my stomach starts to have some discomfort. Loosening my pouch and swinging it over to my hip seems to help.

Mile 20-26: On the way out, I was kind of dreading this section because it looked like it was a lot of uphill running. There was some, but it was a lot more manageable than it looked from the other direction. I have another GU after the mile 20 turnaround. My calfs are starting to feel tight and maybe prone to a cramp, so I ease up a bit. Around Mile 25, the route gets really packed with spectators which powers me through the last mile.

Mile 26.0 - 26.2: I'm feeling pretty gassed at this point. I usually build up to a sprint when I see a finish line, but not this time. I keep my pace and cross the finish line.

Post-race: I waddle off the finish line and down the hot chicken broth and apple juice I am handed. My biggest complaint here is I saw no salty snack. How are there no Philly soft pretzels? Missed opportunity. Overall, I feel decent and happy with my time for not doing a full marathon prep like I probably should.

**TL;DR:** Originally targeted the Marine Corps Marathon (MCM).  Tested positive for COVID the day before the race and decided to DNS.  Signed up for the Philly Marathon immediately with three weeks to recover from the mild case.  Finished Philly with a 10-minute PR.

### Background and Training
I (36M) have run 3 marathons.  The first in 5 hours, the second in 4:30, and most recently the third in 4:14 at the Pittsburgh Marathon 2022.  After that, I did two half marathons (2:14 and 2:01) with less-than-ideal training and some injuries before I signed up for the MCM.  I've been using Jack Daniels 2Q training plan with a peak weekly mileage of 40 since my last marathon.  One reason I like this plan is, since I'm working remotely from home, I have the luxury of doing longer Wednesday morning runs in addition to Sunday long runs.  Another reason is that I find the time-capped long workouts a better fit for my pace than the 20-milers prescribed by some plans.  My training went fine despite a back injury in July.  I did a 10k tune-up race in September in 48 minutes, which greatly boosted my confidence.  I got a slight hamstring strain from the 10k but nothing too bad.  I hit all the long workouts even while traveling.  Everything seemed set for a major PR from last year's 4:14.

### Pre-race MCM
During my taper, I started to have a sore throat 4 days before the race.  After testing negative for COVID twice, I assumed it was just a cold.  My wife and I drove to DC Friday night and I did a shakeout run Saturday morning and felt fine, but tested positive afterward.  I was crushed.  Went to the expo anyway to pick up the packet.  The queue was ridiculously long and I felt I was the only one wearing a mask.  I considered racing despite the mild symptoms but, after reading about others experiencing long COVID post-marathon, decided it was best for my health and others' to DNS.  One silver lining was that MCM turned out to be an unusually warm and humid day so not a day for PR anyway.

### Pre-race Philly
My wife found Philly marathon was still open for registration and I was thrilled.  After registration, I focused on resting to recover from COVID as soon as possible.  I tested negative for COVID within a week and resumed training, repeating the last two weeks of Jack Daniels.  The forecast suggested mid-30s to high-40s conditions, and I decided to race in a short-sleeved shirt rather than a long sleeve, ambitiously aiming for a sub-4 finish.

We flew to Philly on Friday, staying at a hotel right next to the Pennsylvania Convention Center, where the marathon expo was held.  I did a short shakeout run Saturday morning and saw some half marathon and 8k runners racing.  Walking to the expo and getting the packet was much easier than MCM, taking about only 15 minutes.  We had a big lunch in Chinatown and a light pasta dinner.  I slept unbelievably well both nights before the Sunday race.  I woke up at 4 a.m. on Sunday to do my pre-race routine.  We took the shuttle to the marathon security checkpoint and I quickly went through without any issues.  It was chilly even with my disposable raincoat, but the warming tents were a pleasant surprise.  The potty line however took forever so I decided to go straight to my corral instead.

### Race
_Miles 1–13:_
The plan was to maintain a slightly slower pace than my A goal (9:10 min/mi for a 4-hour marathon).  After a crowded first mile, I sped up to meet my wife downtown and ran two sub-9 miles.  Then I tried to slow down a bit, only to be a tad too slow for miles 6–10 (9:20-ish), and my heart rate (HR) gradually rose to 150.  I convinced myself it was the hills.  At mile 9 I felt the urge to use the bathroom just as I ate the second Gu gel.  At this point the potties I had seen seemed sparse and crowded, so I decided to join other runners using the bushes along the roadside.  I felt bad for the female runners for a moment because they didn't have the convenience, but quickly concentrated back on the race.  With the help of some downhills, I managed to increase my pace to between 9 and 9:10 for miles 11–13.  I finished the first half in 2:02, and the fact that it didn't feel exactly easy made me doubt if I could achieve a negative split today.

_Miles 14–20:_
Entering the second half, I knew that to have any chance of a sub-4, I needed to maintain a pace between 9 and 9:10.  I managed this for three miles but then fluctuated.  At this time the aggregated GPS drift on my Garmin was around 0.2 miles, so the actual pace was even a little bit slower. The warming air and my increasingly heavy legs, coupled with My HR rising to the high 150s, indicated that a sub-4 was unlikely.

_Miles 21–25:_
Acknowledging that a sub-4 was out of reach, my focus shifted to achieving a solid PR without hitting the wall.  Balancing the desire to push for a sub 4:05 and the risk of bonking, I decided to trust my training and run by feel.  This reminded me of the quote in Jack Daniels' training plan: ""Run with your head for the first two-thirds of every race and with your heart for the last third"".  I ended up averaging a 9:16 pace over these 5 miles without any major struggles.  Maybe the JD 2Q training worked?

_The final 1.5 miles (according to my Garmin):_
It was a blur.  I finally decided the remaining distance was too short for a significant slowdown and picked up the pace, maintaining an 8:35 pace till the finish.  I felt my finish looked heroic and stupid at the same time: finishing strong looked great, but why didn't I push harder earlier?

### Post-race
Reuniting with my wife after crossing the finish line was a joyful moment.  I was very happy with the time, and thrilled to learn I almost did an even split.  We took the shuttle back to the hotel and were awarded a free late checkout so I could take a much-needed shower.  Later I tried a massage chair at the airport and found it very relaxing.  I think I will start doing this after every future marathon.

One lesson from this experience is the importance of using the bathroom before a race.  My next marathon will be either Chicago, if I win the drawing, or a return to MCM in 2024 to complete the redemption.

# Background 

I have very little athletic experience of note: no high school or college sports, though in my early 20s I did the biking version of long, slow distance: some thousands of miles of bike touring in the mountains, all at a molasses pace. It’s been most of a decade since then, though. For context, I’m 31X, 5’11”, 175lb.

In 2022, I went from 0→10 very slowly, from January until June; then in July increasing my mileage to low-20s. Starting in August, I very erratically “followed” the 80/20 Half Marathon 1 plan, averaging about 18 miles over 3.5 runs a week, and ran the Berkeley Half Marathon in 1:57:30. My partner, running a little more consistently than me, ran the same race in 2:16:20.

I had to start all over in 2023, because two weeks after the 2022 half, I got covid! It took about 2 months to fully recover and get back to daily activities, much less running. I had some other subtle issues start causing me problems at that same time, which made it hard to really pick up the mileage until June.

I spent the first half of the year running 2/week for around 5mpw, similarly to my experience in 2022, with one caveat: my jan-may 2023 mileage was so much slower than my jan-may 2022 mileage.

# Training 

**Base Training**  
I spent June and July trying to get comfortable at an increased mileage, all easy; I fairly suddenly jumped from <10 mpw to 22mpw. It felt okay, but started to be harder and harder, which I originally attributed to “Maybe it’s secretly hot?”. I split the mileage up into 3 mid-length runs and 2 shorter runs, like 5/2/5/2/8.

I got a heart rate monitor strap, and used that to do a lactate threshold test with my watch, which gave me a lactate threshold heart rate of around 178 which in retrospect is very believable, though empirically I think it’s a bit higher… and a threshold pace and power that, in retrospect, have no relationship to reality. Skipping ahead 4 months, even the day after my half, it still insists that my threshold pace is around 9:30 min/mile, and that I could probably run a 2:01 half.

Right at the end of that base-building block, in late July, I had an incident of road rage — some shitty driver blew through a stop sign as I was crossing, and I bolted after them to chew them out — which gave me *three* distinct injuries after my half-year of no speedwork: my hip adductors, knee pain, and a soleus strain, so I started seeing a PT in early August.

**Scheduling & Mileage**   
My partner and I decided to do the slightly-more version of the plan we’d done last year, going from the 80/20 Half Marathon 1 to 2, except modifying by dropping two days of running so that we could just run on weekdays (and have the weekend to do whatever we wanted). If it turned out to be too much for us, we’d reduce the workouts to being closer to HM1’s workouts. The weekly structure, then, was going to be tempo/recovery/interval/recovery/long.

Very quickly, after the first 3 weeks, we decided to add back a 6th day of running (another easy run in between the intervals and the long run) so that the long run could be on the weekend (“We’re just going to be boring people for a few months”).

The one weirdness our reduced-schedule of runs (as written, the plan is 7 days of running; we did 6) caused was that the down weeks weren’t very down, because the day we’d cut out from our schedule was the one where most of the reduced mileage would come from. Didn’t realize this until like 12 weeks in. During the down weeks, I thought “I’m recovering! I’m recovering!” as hard as I could.

We only missed a few runs: two runs (5 miles) due to air quality issues from wildfires, one due to getting covid vaccines (3 miles) and feeling like hot death. We did swap a few workouts for easier versions, or at times just more appealing versions; not much at a time, except for one long run during a down week got chopped by two miles, and we reduced every run in the taper by another third or so.

Overall, I ran 385 miles during the 15 week block, an average of 25.7 miles/week over 5.5 runs/week, a 50% increase in mileage compared to last year.

**Injuries & Maladies**   
My pile of injuries didn’t fully resolve in the first few weeks of running, but very quickly became tolerable. The PT was okay with me holding my mileage constant, and okay with me holding my intensity-mileage constant, and instead of listening to him, I increased my mileage and intensity every week. To everyone’s surprise, it never blew up in my face.

Big problem that got resolved quickly: I was absurdly tired for the first three weeks of the plan. It was a struggle to run 12:30/mile. I wanted it to just be that I was tired from the increase in intensity, but my partner, who was so much slower than me last year, who had also taken off 6 months from running, was kicking my ass to the extent that they were really worried about me. Off to the doctor I went, lots of bloodwork, and the conclusion we all reached is that **Isotreinoin (Accutane) really, really messes with energy levels** (no shit?). Partner talked me into discontinuing it, which I did, and I felt better within literal days. Totally worth taking it, but maybe not while training for anything.

**80/20 Half Marathon 2**   
I have some issues with how the programming in 80/20, though I don’t half enough credentials to really back it all up. I do agree with the general thrust — the vast majority of running should be easy, and when it’s hard, make it count.

I didn’t think I needed to do 6 weeks of short 1-minute intervals, so I didn’t, and I substituted the second block with “long interval” runs, which pretty quickly led to notable improvements in my threshold/tempo paces. Perhaps I’d’ve had as much improvement but compressed if I hadn’t swapped that 3-week cycle, but at least from a race-confidence perspective, I’m glad I included that style of workout earlier.

There’s a lot of little things that were all just weird. When people in r/running and r/advancedrunning talk about doing hill repeats, they mostly talk about shorter efforts like 15-30seconds; this plan started with 30s and went up to 60s (and some plans use 90 seconds?). There’s a kind of run that in the book is called “speedplay”, and as written, is just intervals, nothing fartlek-y about it. Lots of people do strides the week of their race, sure, but it felt a little weird for the plan as written to have max-effort intervals two days before without explanation.

There’s a certain one-size-fits-all nature to the plans — we’re going to use the exact same workouts for a 5k plan, a half marathon, a marathon — that didn’t feel right to me.

Also some weirdness with how everything but the long run is described by time. I believe I was running the easy runs \~25% slower than expected, but I had no idea until I saw a comment by someone who had asked the author directly, where the response was that for a very slow runner, it would be better to convert the time-based workouts back to distance at a conversion of 10 minutes/mile for easy runs. Does this mean I was less prepared? Kinda, yeah?

Some of this was exacerbated by how I implemented the workouts: I programmed all the workouts into my watch using garmin’s power zones, which ultimately didn’t work great for me. The automatic-adjustments made by running with the heart rate strap didn’t adjust in lockstep, or anywhere close, with my actual improvements, so I ended up running basically everything according to vibes. I think this was totally fine for things like tempo and easy runs, admittedly 95% of the running, and really awful for maximal work, which was focused in the first half of the plan. All my “z3” and “z4” running in the second half of the plan ended up being at the same pace, which probably wasn’t intended.

There’s no guidance on what your race pace should be (or perhaps I’m illiterate and there’s an entire chapter, but I did check). Probably that’s because the book wants to describe everything in terms of zones, z1-z5, and you just can’t say that HMP is z3 or z4, even if you do have z3 and z4 rigorously defined.

(For what it’s worth, the author’s more recent book, Run Like a Pro, seems to have addressed most of the issues I bring up above, but …)

**Improvements over the training cycle / What is my goal time?**   
I saw this issue coming 6 weeks before the race, when my speed started to make fairly dramatic improvements — in the first weeks of the plan, it was hard to hold 9:30min/mile for 5 minutes, and even week 8, 9:00/mile for any time was kinda hard; by week 10, I was running 8:30/mile for 25 minutes.

(My recovery/easy paces also sped up dramatically — though maybe it’s better to call them “paces I recover from in well under 24 hours”, distinguishing only because my % heart rate is higher than most people would call “easy” — going from 12:00-12:30 down to 10:45-11:30.)

Fortunately, there was a cheap and convenient 10k race in week 10, so we swapped that week’s 12 mile long run for 3 miles (run to the race) + 6 miles (race!) + 3 miles (run home from the race). Didn’t really prepare for it: no mini-taper, no carb-loading, just went to bed a little early the night before. I didn’t have a great idea on how to pace myself, so I tried to aim for progressive negative splits. I ran a [51:25](https://www.strava.com/activities/10038361023/overview) (8:16 pace), which didn’t feel quite like I’d given it my all, but was definitely close. Getting home was very painful.

I felt of two minds about the predicted 1:53-1:54 half from that race: it sounded both really hard and it didn’t feel like a big improvement over last year’s race.

Naturally, after running that 8:16 pace for 10k, I was completely unable to do anything remotely close to that speed in the weeks after, so I was getting kinda nervous during peak week (36 miles). My fast runs that week ended up being more like 8:30-8:40 pace. I did do fine on our 14-mile long run that week, where we ran the hilly half of the race course.

The plan says it has a two-week taper, but during the first week of the taper, we ran as much as we did in any other up-week. In the second week, I pulled back harder than the plan suggested, though I kept the intensity very high for the little bit of fast running that I did. To my surprise, on the Wednesday and Saturday before the race, I comfortably-uncomfortably ran 7:30 pace for a few intervals, which made me finally kinda comfortable about the idea of holding 8:45 for the half.

# Pre-race 

**Carb Loading**   
Very half-assedly and unhappily increased the proportion of diet coming from carbs in the 3 days leading up to the race. The Featherstone nutrition calculator that “everyone” uses said that i should eat 600g/day for 3 days, which absolutely wasn’t going to happen. I did get to about 450g/day, which only sucked a bit: double bagels for breakfast, 4 slices of bread for lunch (pb&j, eventually just buttered sheets of bread), roasted potatoes for dinner (thurs, fri) or pasta with tomatoes (saturday), an unevenly-split half-gallon of apple juice each day. 125g from the bagel, 80g from the bread, 100g from the potatoes (nearly 2lb each), 150-180g from the apple juice. I guess this is a bit easier if you weigh less and run more.

**Taking It Easy During Taper Week**   
Tried to cut down on going out during the taper week, which was pretty easy to do because it was raining incessantly, and also I’m a total shut-in. I felt pretty drained and unmotivated except when i was running ᖍ(ツ)ᖌ but did my best to attribute that to obviously i’m conserving energy and yeah it’s dark at 4:45pm. Tried to get plenty of sleep, usually went to bed a half-hour later or so than i meant to (playing a lot of octopath 2).

Casually cleaned up the whole house the day before the race (swapped my sheets, all the laundry, vacuumed, dishes), made cinnamon rolls, pinned the bibs on our jerseys (took forever), and went to bed pretty early: in bed at 9:15pm, asleep by 9:45 or so. Basically, assumed I was going to be out of commission after the race, and asked what would be nice to have done in advance.

**Race Morning**   
Woke up at 5:35, sat around in the bathroom for a bit, shaved, got dressed, ate a banana & a caffeine pill. Thought we had plenty of time, so sat around a little longer, and we biked over at 6:30. I completely forgot to put contacts in, though I don’t usually wear them when running, only for biking. We made it to the starting area with no other hiccups, arriving at about 6:50. In retrospect, we didn’t have quite as much time as I would’ve liked; ten minutes earlier would’ve been better.

The temperature at the start was much warmer (50f) than last year’s, to my mixed relief and regret. I didn’t mind not freezing my ass off before the race, but worried I would overheat later, which fortunately didn’t happen.

On arriving, took our bikes in the bike parking area, swapped from biking shoes to running shoes, took the second caffeine pill (and felt disreputable doing so), ditched our jackets & bike shoes at gear check (same-day gear check was only for people who had their packet mailed! i don’t like it, but at least I’d had my packet mailed), and then it was already 7:10; the warm-up running would have to be a bit shorter than planned. Slowly jogged for a few minutes, accelerated to past race pace and back down, and that was all i had time for. (7:20). I didn’t stress it because the biking had felt pretty good, and I was planning to go out kinda easy and negative split.

For unknown but happy reasons, I’d been assigned to corral A, not that it was particularly enforced. I got in position 10 or so feet behind the 1:55 pacer. I spent the next few minutes before the start of the race texting my in-laws & some friends, trying to give them a gps tracking link (I failed, but had no idea until after the race, when they all said that the link hadn’t worked).

**Race Nutrition**   
It probably didn’t really matter to have it super dialed in, because it was a half marathon under 2 hours. I had some honey stinger chews with me, and whenever I needed motivation, I ate one in the manner of a chipmunk to maximize the amount of time there was sugar in my mouth/avoid choking/hell yeah psychological effect. I went through most of a bag in this manner during the race.

At each aid station I grabbed a cup of water, drank from it as much as I both wanted & felt comfortable — usually about half — and dumped the rest over my head. This was more of a struggle; I actually felt kinda thirsty for most of the race, but the one time I drank most of the cup I ended up with a brief side stitch for a few minutes. Fortunately, it went away pretty quick and didn’t return. At one point I grabbed a cup of nuun by accident, and I was so surprised that I just dropped it on myself.

# Race

**First Hill (Miles 0.0-3.4)**   
My plan was to stick with the pacer, and re-evaluate how i felt at 4 points (the end of the first big uphill, the second big uphill, the beginning of the flat section, the beginning of the final climb) to decide when to split off to go closer to 1:50. If for some reason I didn’t manage to run with the pacer, my plan was to be chill for the first mile until it thinned a bit, then negative-effort-split, run safely for a 1:55 the first half, and push it in the second half.

Instantly, I got separated from the 1:55 pacer, stuck behind people running slower than i wanted to be. I played it cool for a block or two, and at the first turn with a bit of uphill the crowd thinned out, and then it was easy to catch back up to the 1:55 pace group.

Instead, I stuck with them for most of the first mile… but got kinda frustrated by how much mental effort it was taking to stay near the pacer when so many people were all around me, and I decided to gently speed up and get ahead a little bit. A little after the first mile marker, I realized that 30 or so feet ahead of me was the 1:50 pace group. I decided to back down, because I had obviously gone out too hot. I didn’t back down but continued at 8:15 pace for the next half mile on Telegraph, though the 1:50 pace group still pulled away from me.

The race entered UC Berkeley’s campus, much steeper than the gentle 1.5%ish of telegraph. 5%? I’d just run it 3 weeks ago, so I knew it was steep but not too long. The downhill was worse in a way, in that I don’t know how to run downhill; I always feel like I’m out of control. I had a funny pain in part of my heels that unnerved me, but it stopped with the end of the decline.

**Second Hill (Miles 3.4-4.6)**   
More semi-undulating uphill, and I was feeling it a bit more this time. I tried to focus on a couple of runners ahead of me who seemed to be going about my pace. Wondered about the guy in front of me wearing an orange windbreaker, like, damn, dude, aren’t you hot? I’m hot. Some spectators sitting in folding chairs on the side of the road loudly announced WE’RE AN UNOFFICIAL AID STATION. WE HAVE SHEPHERD’S PIE. which made me laugh and choke from disgust. Someone ran near me from time to time, blasting Nirvana from their portable speaker.

It’d been a while since I lost sight of the 1:50 group, and other runners kept passing me on the modest uphill, but I tried to not let it get to me. (From my relative placements at the 5k/4.2 mile timing mats, It seems I was also passing people and just didn’t notice.) I wrote off my dream of going sub 1:50, but was ready to be content with my presumed 1:54 time.

The three mini peaks didn’t phase me too bad; short and steep. I must’ve taken them a little harder than I meant to, because my heart rate jumped a little, but they didn’t feel too bad.

**Downhill (Miles 4.6-7.4)**   
It took me a minute to catch my breath and speed up, but I did manage to hold a pace in the 7:30/mile range for most of the downhill. After a half mile of that, I realized the 1:50 pace group was right in front of me. I caught up to them shortly before we turned onto Monterey (5.5 miles).

The course flattened out somewhat, from -5% to maybe -2%, or from “flying downhill” to “this isn’t downhill, I’m just good at running, right?” (no). By the time we reached Fourth Street, where it really flattened out, I was beginning to feel it, but I put aside those thoughts and focused on staying with the pacers.

**Flat (Miles 7.4-10.8)**   
The bump that was the overpass was short and not notable. Unfortunately, turning south, the sun in the clear cloudless sky was very notable. I told myself I had less than ten minutes of this bullshit. I desperately hugged the left side of the road, pretending that the chain-link fence in between me and the freeway might block out some of the sun. There was a surprising lack of freeway noise due to stand-still traffic; near the turnaround there was a car crash. I was malaised. Struggling. Dissociating but not even in a cool or helpful way. I stepped funny in a pothole due to the blinding sun. I followed the pacer. I felt like I was losing my vision. Finally I saw the water station and knew the turnaround was imminent, but it was still some hundred feet away. Finally, at last, we turned…

Headwind. I’m cold suddenly, but at least I’m no longer in a dazed state running directly into the sun! I had an easier time negotiating with myself to keep running on the north leg, though my speed didn’t particularly change. *If the wheels fall off, they fall off, but keep running until then! This is what you paid for! It’s supposed to hurt! If you can still think, it must not be that bad. Once you’ve run out of energy, you can run without fear of running out of energy.* I watched the slower pace groups on the southern leg as I looked for my partner behind me: the 1:55 group, the 2:00 group, and then I saw my partner. I meant to say “it’ll feel better when you turn around!” but it was too many words, so I’m afraid I just shouted incoherently instead.

My across-the-street neighbor, who’s much faster than me and does hilly hilly trail runs, said in conversation “the overpass really blew me up!”. I have no idea what he’s talking about. The overpass did you in? Not the 2.5 mile uphill slog right after? No, he insisted, the overpass. (I’m not sure we ran the same course. He ran it 20 minutes faster than me, too.)

**Final Uphill (10.8-13.1)**   
It’s a 1.5% or so grade. It’s not that bad! I run up this slope every week during the long run, and then some! It hurt so much. My internal negotiations, when they existed, started to include math: *there’s 2 miles left, so that’s… 18 minutes? I don’t like that number. I’m probably less than 8 minutes from the last water stop of the course*. But mostly I didn’t think much.

I asked the pacers: If I stick with you, will I make it under 1:50? Yes, they reassured me. I was sure their math was off by a minute, but I didn’t have the oomph to pull ahead of them. I’m not even sure if any one else was running with the 1:50 pacers at that point, at least not knowingly. There had been a small crowd when I joined at mile 5.5, but they were all gone by this point (or maybe I can’t recognize faces to save my life).

People were bunched up at the corners, cheering, playing music, holding out signs (“Touch to power up!” one read, and I couldn’t reach it. The person running next to me said it was transitive and told me to smack their hand instead). I tried to smile and cheer back, because if I can cheer, I must not be feeling that bad and can keep going.

I realized we were reaching the last set of turns (Bancroft→McKinley→Channing→MLK) and I did my best to pull ahead from the pacers, finish strong and all of that bullshit. I don’t think I actually pulled ahead until the final block -- my clock time was only 10 seconds ahead of the pacers.

The timer above the finish line read 1:50:29 when I passed under it, and when I stopped my watch a few seconds later, it read 1:50:07.

# Afterwards 

**Post Race**   
I’d missed my *haha just kidding… unless…?* goal by seconds, but I couldn’t be disappointed, because I was very aware that I’d gone as hard as I could. As soon as I had stopped running, everything hurt: my feet, my knees, my hips, my adductors, I’d even pulled something in my arms. I staggered through the finisher’s chute — how am I supposed to hold my water bottle, my banana, my local granola, my energy bars, my pretzels, and my medal? maybe they took away the space blankets because they felt bad about how much stuff they were loading us down with — and teetered out to the park. I only walked into three or four people. Sorry, people in the finisher’s chute with me.

I had come to terms with my finishing time (it didn’t take long) when my sister in law texted me, congratulating me on my time on -- surprise! -- my finishing time of 1:49:58. It was a funny feeling, being so excited and having no energy to express it with.

I waited for my partner near the finish line (9 minute pr!). We thought about drinking our Free Beer, but the line just to enter the beer corral was across the park, and we decided to go home before rigor mortis set in. The ride home was the roughest 3.5 mile ride of my life; neither of us could bike uphill without cramping.

Shower, cinnamon rolls, couch, a few teeny short walks of a quarter mile to not totally seize up. My left hip adductor was (and is) in a bad way; I didn’t tie my shoes very well during the race & my foot kept slipping & I think I have a solid chance of losing a toenail; but everything else feels mostly okay. Late in the day we discovered a nascent ant infiltration, which we spent an hour dealing with; miserably painful, top 5 worst times for an ant problem, next race-day’s prep list is including Spray Outside For Ants.

**Next Time**   
Going to spend the winter building up mileage in a casual way. I hope when I say “casual way” that I get to have a life, and that I’m not just thinking “casual!” really hard. It’s also probably the case that if I stuck with this mileage, or increased it gradually, I’d probably still see some improvements.

It looks like that we’re both going to run another half in March, though maybe not doing much half-specific training, and then re-evaluating. I’d like to use a different plan next time I do a specific training cycle, though I’m not sure which.

If I’d been more confident about sub-1:50, I think the race might’ve gone a little more comfortably by starting with the 1:50 pace group, but given that I caught up to them, lost them, & caught up again, I think I needed some extra time to warm up. I think I went a little hotter on the first half than was right, but not sure that, had I slowed down 10sec/mile for the first half, I would’ve gone more than 10sec/mile faster on the back half. Maybe?

# Training 

Stats: 34M, 5’10, 204lbs

I don’t have a running background, although I was athletic in high school and college, swimming competitively (100 & 200 freestyle) at a high level from age \~8 to age 22. A few years ago, I did some distance cycling, up to 125mi days. My family tends to be good at aerobic endurance; my sister ran cross country in HS, also swam competitively, and has run a few HMs as well. My father ran throughout my childhood and had a marathon PB of 3:18, just off of BQ at the time for him.

Personally, I’d gotten very out of shape over the 2020-2021 weird COVID years and took up running on more or less New Year’s Day 2022. I did the Berkeley Half last year as my first HM, with a time of 2:16, off of inconsistently following the 80/20 HM beginner plan.

Then, we moved out of our apartment into a house, I got COVID, I got laid off while barely recovered from COVID, and I gained a bunch of weight; I’ve hovered around 200lbs since leaving school, but with all those stressors and lack of exercise, was up to 218lbs before the start of this training plan. Weighed in today at 204lbs; still over my goal weight but near where I’ve been the last 10 years.

So, I started this cycle with “I’ve run before, but have no base right now”. For a month or two before the plan, I built up to around 20-22mpw—easy runs during the week and a longer (6-8mi) run on Fridays with nothing on the weekends.

16 weeks out from the half, I started following the 80/20 HM intermediate plan for the most part, although we slowly shifted from my current weekdays-only running to first doing a very light run on Friday before a Saturday long run, and then eventually a full 6-days-a-week. Peak mileage was around 34mpw, with a good chunk of weeks spent around 30mpw. The structure was generally a tempo run on Monday, an interval session on Wednesday, long run on Saturday, and 30-45min easy runs on the other days.

Selecting a pace was a bit confusing. I had a few good efforts: a (not certified and slightly long) 10k in 57min during a peak week, and a couple of 30+min tempo runs comfortably around 9:00/mi. I’ve had a tough time nailing down heart rate / aerobic intensity of my efforts: my HR would hover around 180 for those tempo runs, which garmin said was above lactate threshold, but my HR wouldn’t budge above 180 over the course of those 30 minutes, and it looks like I genuinely have a pretty high max HR for my age. I’m 34 but reliably recorded 201-203 HRs on an electrode HR strap at effort.

So based on that I decided to go for a 2h pace. It would probably hurt but it seemed very doable.  If I could push down to 9min/mi I’d smash 2h.

See more detail about our training and the pre-race in [my partner’s race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1807nyu/berkeley_half_marathon_75_mpw_75_minute_pr/).

# Race

Berkeley’s course is pretty tough; you start off with some relatively steep climbs, there’s a flat middle section, and then a somewhat demoralizing uphill slog of a finish. My plan was to go out ahead of the 2h pacer, try holding 9min miles, adjusting a bit for the hills. If I saw the 2h pacer I’d focus on holding on as hard as possible.

The first few miles went okay. In that 10k during training, I’d flown out of the start so I wanted to try to hold back here, and I ended up holding back a little too far. As we got up the last of the hills at the start, I felt okay, but not great, and then I tweaked my left hip flexor on the crest of the last hill, which is also a turn through a roundabout into an immediate downhill. It immediately started hurting, I felt like I couldn’t really push it, like there was suddenly an upper limit that hadn’t been there before. So my idea to gain a bit of time through the downhill was suddenly a lot more challenging than I’d hoped for. I managed to do that, and ticked through 6.5mi total right near an hour, so I figured with the “easier” second half I could probably stay near my goal.

Unfortunately the pain in my hip continued to get worse, and running the bit of the course that goes along the bay trail by the water was completely draining. I figured I was doing okay, since I still hadn’t seen the 2h pacer. I tried to fuel with gummies whenever I felt particularly bad, but it was hard to discern aerobic capacity vs decreased performance due to the hip flexor, so my fueling went to crap as well.

As we rounded into the overpass leaving the bay trail, I was just… done. I didn’t know what to do. I stopped running to grab water at the next fueling station, tried to eat some gummies but just felt ill, and watched my heartrate rise while basically standing still. I walked for a bit to drink the water and tried to pull myself together, but my splits just fell off a cliff as did any hope of getting anywhere close to 2h. I was struggling to find motivation—PR in the bag since I was still in much better shape than last year even hobbling along, but no clear goals anywhere in sight. And weirdly, I still hadn’t been passed by the 2h pacer?

In hindsight, I think the pacer passed me during one of the route alternations where they send runners on different paths to let traffic pulse through, so my fallback plan of gluing myself to the 2h pacer never happened either.

I just couldn’t get it together over the last miles, didn’t eat anything, and pretty much stumbled over the line in a lot of pain. My injured hip was painful enough that I had to be careful about how to lean to grab all the finisher goodies.

# Post-race 

That sucked a lot. 

For many different reasons, I couldn’t find motivation from any sources—crowd, pacers, other runners, or within, and it ended up being very rough. But, I got a solid PR and it seems that the injury isn’t too bad even just one day later; I can walk around, and although that hip is particularly painful it doesn’t seem like this is going to be a lasting injury.

I’m not blaming the course—plenty of people manage it well—but personally I couldn’t get those hills dialed on, so my next HM will definitely be one on an easier course: uphill to start and end just isn’t fun and I need to learn how to pace without being thrown in the deep-end.

In hindsight, 2h was probably pushing it and I probably wouldn’t have blown up if I’d been really careful on the hills and accepted 15-20sec slower splits elsewhere. That probably would’ve gotten me a better result than going a bit fast to hit a goal. But, that would’ve put me in between pacers anyway (not that I got to run with one) and still with a lot of questions about how to do the hills. I don’t think there were any good solutions for me this time around; more experience is needed.

I’m not sure whether I screwed up nutrition. It’s only 2h, so this doesn’t seem like my struggles came from lack of energy, but I probably should’ve been a bit more strict about fueling anyway. I went through about 250cal of gummies. Ignoring the first hour (powered by glycogen) that’s still probably not enough calories?  On my long runs I’ve liked the gummies, but during the race, eating was definitely making me feel a bit ill in those last few miles. Might look at less sweet gels (maurten and others) for next time.

I’m still overweight for what I want to do, so over this winter my plan is to actually watch calories, lose some weight (targeting 180 to start, which is where i was in swimmer shape, though it’s going to take more than just “the winter” to get there), and build up the mileage to a base of 40-45 before starting another training plan.

I think I’m done with the plans from the 80/20 book. The 80/20 idea is obviously good—and pretty much every modern plan follows that ratio anyway. The plans in the book have a lot of very high intensity, very short intervals, even when aiming for a longer distance like a half marathon. It had 30-60sec sprint efforts for multiple weeks as the speed work, for example. I think I’ll look at the Pfitz HM plan or the Hanson plan instead; assuming I succeed in getting that base mileage up those should be easily doable.

It’s been rough but I’ve mostly managed to spin this into some motivation for next time and I guess that’s enough for now.

**Build up / Training**

I've had this race on my radar since 2016 but due to various reasons it kept getting put off. This year I decided to commit and register to save myself from excuses.  To add to my motivation my friend (previously non-runner) convinced his sister and colleagues to register for the same day 8k so we could train together. This led to an overly ambitious commitment of me registering for the ""Patriot Challenge"" which is the half marathon and 8km race the same day separated by 2 hours. The hype was definitely real - we registered under a team name, started to look up training programs, bought some fresh Asics together and started tracking workouts on strava.

I have somewhat of a remote running background. The last time I participated in an organized running event was in high school cross country and competed in a sprint distance triathlon (over 12 years ago). Since HS years I ran intermittently but mostly in the 3-5 mile range.

Training for this event was sporadic and inconsistent to say the least. Base training in August - September was mostly 2-4 miles 3 times a week. I found an 8 week training plan pdf online and did my best to stick with but was often skipping runs due to work related obligations. My longest run 8 miles about 2 weeks prior to the event. Unfortunately, again hit the inconsistency train and only had 1 training run in the 2 weeks leading up to the race. 

Overall, most of my runs were had pace consistent with a sub 2 hour run but I knew I did not have enough mileage to maintain that pace for 13 miles. Realistically with spotty training my reasonable goal was to finish and my reach was to complete the run within 2:10.  
  
**Pre-race**

The night before I had my race day bag setup with the clothes, gels, etc. My race partner and I carb loaded with tacos (not the ideal choice but they were amazing). 

Started the race day waking up at 4:45AM. Got dressed. Tried to force down a bagel (race day jitters -wasn't hungry but knew carbs were a must). I took an Uber down to the starting area and was surprised to see how long the lines were. After a \~30mins wait to get through I was left with 15 mins to check in my bags and quick bathroom run (Yes, more long lines). The race was set to start at 7:00am but there were some delays with clearance which worked out for me. I was able to hunt down the 2:10 pace group and line up with my corral just in time.   
  
  
**Race**  
  
To start the race the first half mile was very congested slowing down my pace. After the field opened up I was able to get into my comfortable race pace. The first 3-6 miles were flat and filled with volunteers cheering on runners which made it go by by quickly.  The second half was another story. The wind picked up and felt head on at some points and there was a bit of an incline at some parts which really took a toll on me. I hit the ""wall"" around mile 8-9 but managed to keep on. To add, after mile 10 there are portions without volunteers or race officials steering the course which made things feel much slower. Despite this I did my best to keep going and achieve my goal of finishing off the race. The last mile had a gradual incline back to the finish line but the area became more familiar which mentally made it easier to get by. The last km I did my best to pick up the pace but I knew there was not much left in the tank crossing the finish line with a nice ""I did it"" moment. 

Nutrition/hydration - I stopped at every water station at an abundance of caution. I took an energy gel around mile 6-7 and Cliff energy blocks were given out around mile 9.   
  
**Post-race**

Enjoyed the race and was happy to finish within my goal. I know I would have done better on timing if I had been more consistent with my training runs. I think a sub 2 hour half marathon is possible next time I do this.   
  
As for the 8km run - there was a 2 hour gap between races. During that time I tried to stay loose but it in the 40-50's with a good amount of wind so I ended up getting super tight. I went through with the second race finishing the first 2.5 miles without stopping but after the first water station I could not get going again. I ended up laboring through the last bit alternating between walking and running to get a finishing time of 1:07. 

Overall, happy to know I can do it and now more motivated to get a sub 2 hr half marathon time the next time I give it a go. My previously non-runner race partner is planning on making the plunge into the half marathon distance next race as well. So win/win weekend for me.

### Training
This was my (28F) first marathon! I have never been a long distance runner but have been active for most of my life through sports, workout classes, short (< 3 mile) runs but I moved to a new city on the west coast and started to take up running back in March. I ran a half marathon in June and had an official time of 2:19.

I continued to run and used the track club babe running plan that consisted of running 4-5 days a week. In the 16 weeks leading up to the marathon, I had one international trip, 3 weddings across the country, started a new job and moved to a new place which made it difficult to stick to the training plan and develop a consistent routine but I did the best I could and completed the majority of it. The longest run I did was 18 miles.

As you can see, I had no idea what to expect so I set multiple goals for myself. Sub 4:45 felt ambitious but potentially attainable, sub 5 felt doable but still a challenge and running the whole thing also felt like a challenge based on some of my longer runs. I also discovered that running really... gets my bowels moving. I found myself needing to stop on most of my long runs to use the bathroom. That was a big concern for me going into race day.

### Pre-race
My friend and I (her first marathon too) got to the race at 6am, checked in and found our corral. We waited over 45 minutes to use the bathroom and made it just in time. I finally was able to poop before the race and I also took an Imodium at 6:30 which I had never done before (risky, I know). And then we were off!


### Race
Miles 1-6 

I started off feeling good. My friend must've been feeling good too because she waved goodbye and took off ahead after the first mile (which was totally fine). I saw my family and miles 1 & 6 which kept my spirits high.

My plan was to take a gel roughly every 4 miles and I also brought candy with me in case I felt like I needed some food. I had a handheld water bottle filled with water I sipped along the way and ran through the aid stations and grabbed the electrolyte drinks.

Miles 6-10 

Also feeling good and had not stopped! Took a second gel around mile 8. Listening to music so far and maintaining my pace. I noticed that my watch was out of sync and it would say I completed the mile a few minutes before reaching the mile marker, so I was trying to do some runners math and figure out my actual pace. A 4:45 was still in sight but unlikely at this point - that was okay though. Really just wanted to get sub 5.

Miles 10-16 

Was starting to feel it but would and could not let myself think any negative thoughts. Per my official race report, I hit the halfway mark at 2:24, which is what I had estimated based on the running clock time on my watch. At this point, I had not walked and took a 3rd and 4th gel at miles 12 and 16. 

The week prior, I had friends and family make voice recordings of anything they wanted to share with me while running my first marathon - words of encouragement, stories, jokes, etc and compiled it all together in an audio file that was almost 1.5 hours. This gave me so much motivation to pull through for a few more miles.

Miles 16-20 

A little after mile 17, I walked for the first time. I didn't even think about it - I just found myself walking. I was watching my average pace on my watch and when it would creep up 1-2 seconds, I would start running again. I sort of kept this up for the next few miles. I tried to time my walking through the aid stations. 

I felt like I could no longer stomach the gels so I switched to a few pieces of candy here and there. I was trying to think positive but it was getting reallly really rough. There were a few loop sections but on the last out and back portion, I had passed my friend who was looping back to the finish line. It was hard to tell how far she was ahead but I tried to keep pushing.

Miles 20-26 

I did my walk/run method from about miles 17-24 roughly. At this point, I knew I would be really close to sub 5, and It would really come down to these last few miles. I texted my sister saying ""6 miles to go, in so much pain"" around mile 20 and she responded saying, ""I'm so proud of you, dig deep - you can do this.""

It was at this time where the 5:00 pacer group caught up to me, and I knew they had started after me. At this point I had around 2 miles to go, and I knew I would be regretting it in ~20 minutes if I didn't run as fast as I could. I ran my heart out. I passed the 25 mile marker and my total running time had said 4:45. I could do it! I saw my sister maybe 1 minute before the finish line. At this point, I had tears in my eyes and ran through the finish line so happy to be done! My friend had finished 3 minutes before me and we both were just so happy and proud for each other!


### Post-race
I finished with all 10 toenails, 1 blister, minimal chafing and a lot of soreness. I saw my family after the finish line. They said it was so chaotic and difficult to get to the front to see the finish line but my sister ditched them and was able to push through. It truly meant the world to have supporters there. 

I loved the crowd and energy, but I'm still not sure if I would do another marathon. Maybe a smaller one would be better in some ways. Not sure if all the bigger ones are like this, but the lines to the portapotties throughout the entire event were ridiculous...probably 10+ mins long at each aid station. I was so thankful for that Imodium because I wouldn't have reached my goal without it. I can't say I will run a marathon again, but I can say I am a marathoner!

# Training

This race wasn’t actually supposed to be my first half marathon. I began training in earnest in April for The Disney World Half Marathon I will be competing in on January 6, 2024, but, a few months into training, I felt like I was in decent shape and wanted to try my hand at the distance locally first. Something about competing in my first half marathon while on vacation and after out-of-state travel just made me nervous. I really wanted to be able to trust my body to go the distance during the Disney World race after the chaos of travel.

Because I have a one-year-old daughter, I kept my training regimen pretty light. I targeted 20mpw with at least one speed workout per week. Those speed workouts included 40-minute Farleks, 8x400m intervals, and tempo runs with a targeted race pace of about 9 minutes per mile. My long runs were always 8-10 miles. I should note while this was my first training regimen for a half marathon that I have previously raced in 5Ks and my PR at that distance is 24:50. I had initially set my goal for the half marathon in January for 2:00:00. That felt like a achievable time based off my 5K and 10K times. For this precursory race, I told myself it was more about familiarizing myself with the distance and the rigors of racing and that I’d be happy with 2:05:00 and ecstatic with anything under two hours.

I honestly started running in order to justify my obsession with shoes, so I run in A LOT of different models, but I wanted to list what I considered the most valuable pairs to my rotation:

**- Nike Invincible 2**: Long runs

**- Saucony Endorphin Speed 2**: Speed workouts

**- Asics Novablast 2**: Daily training

**Honorable mentions: New Balance Rebel v2** (speed workouts), **Adidas Boston 11** (long runs)

I also maintain a piece of Python software for analyzing running shoes using the Strava API if you're interested: [https://github.com/zwinslett/strava-shoe-explore](https://github.com/zwinslett/strava-shoe-explore)

# Pre-race

It was a mixed blessing that the date of this race overlapped with the dates some friends were visiting from out of town. On one hand, I really enjoyed having them attend the event to cheer me on. On the other, it meant late nights and cocktails. We spent the evening before the race bar hopping, but I gladly volunteered to be the designated driver, which kept my imbibing to a minimum. I was in bed by 10:30PM with an alarm set for 6:00AM.

# Race

The race started at 8AM. I arrived at 7:30AM and initially lined up with the 2:15:00 pace group with the thought that I’d take a little slower at first and see how I felt after our night out. This is the first of many times I’ll be praising the pacers at this race. I chatted briefly with the 2:15:00 sign holder about my training and goals, and she immediately recommended I line up with the 2:00:00 group and just fall back if felt uncomfortable. As you can see from my splits, this proved to be such valuable advice. I cannot thank her enough.

The beginning of the race was little shaky, but not for the usual reasons. My body felt very strong right from the gun. I can’t say the same for my shoe strings. My right shoe came untied twice in the first 2.5 miles, which forced me to pull over twice and then sprint to catch up with my pacers. All of this was exacerbated by the fact I was wearing gloves that made it nigh impossible to lace up competently. On the second stop, I lost the gloves for the rest of the race out of fear of another untied lace. Fortunately, the second stop was the last.

Miles 1-7 went so much better than I anticipated. I felt very strong and nearly got a 10K PR. I had never run with pacers before and I cannot express how helpful it was. Being able to focus only on the action of running, which is hard enough on its own, without having to worry about being overtaken by adrenaline or constantly looking down at my watch was invaluable for this first-timer. On top of that, our pacers went above and beyond by giving encouragement, calling out obstacles like potholes and train tracks, and alerting us to aid stations.

At mile 7, I ran side-by-side with my pacer and joked with him that if I hit my goal after a night out did that mean I had to go out every night before a race from now on. He regaled me with a few tales of his own about the virtues of of drinking and racing, which was a welcome distraction. He then dropped a really encouraging note around mile 8: we had more than 2 minutes of cushion on the 2:00:00 target time. With that in mind, I felt really confident about reaching and even exceeding my goal.

Mile 10.5 is where I left the pacers. They slowed down at an aid station for folks to drink water and catch a breather if they needed, which was provided for by that valuable cushion they had built into the race, but I was feeling confident and grabbed a gel in stride, scarfed it down, and kept my foot on the gas.

Miles 10.5-13.1 were uncharted territory. I had not only left behind the pacers that had set the stage for a perfect race, but this was also officially longer than any training run I had ever done. My form started breaking down a bit in the final stretch as my upper body felt tight, but I finished strong. I think the liquor from the night before caught up with my stomach around mile 12, but that was just additional motivation to finish and find a bathroom. I’m keen on mantras and affirmations, so during this final stretch I was ticker taping “This isn’t aspirational; it’s achievable” in relation to a sub-2 finish time.

I crossed the finish line at 1:56:09.28. I felt like I emptied the tank but I wasn’t keeling over. I was mostly in a daze— the final mile or so was trance like. Once I snapped out of it and hit “end” on my watch, it hit me and I felt euphoric. Unofficially, Strava says I ran 13.27 miles and my half marathon time was 1:54:50.

# Post-race

I’ll be brief here as I haven’t fully processed the race myself.

* Pacers were invaluable! You can see in my splits that mile 1 and mile 13 clocked in at 8:39/mile. As a first-timer, I would’ve never been able to do this without a pacer. I’m so thankful they were there.
* Nike Vaporflys are not just for elites. Don’t let anyone make you feel like you’re too slow to wear these as long as they’re comfortable to you. I had never run longer than 6 miles in these shoes after buying them on a whim. My legs felt so protected, and, forgetting whatever they did for my time, I don’t think I would’ve enjoyed this race as much without them. Having fun is the priority after all.
* Perhaps an odd observation, but I noticed in the pictures from the race that I’m tight in my upper body and running like a T-Rex in some places. Does anyone have advice for this besides trying to be more conscious about form?

### First Marathon & Training 


My first marathon was NYC last year and as most know, the heat made it a disaster for most, myself included. I crashed at mile 8 and then walk, jogged, cried for the next 4 hours to finish at a ~5:13. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. I probably cried the entire next day at how little fun I had and how horrible the experience was. Why does anyone even run marathons!??? NYC is supposed to be magical! It sucked!!!!


I decided to take time to reset and use the solid cardio base I had developed over the course of training to switch back to HM training. I made a lot of additional fitness progress: got used to running 6 days a week, avg HR continued to drop for easy runs, threw in a mix of medium distances and tougher speed work using Daniels Running Formula. I PRed by over 6 minutes in April 2023 with a time of 1:42:45. This rekindled some confidence I am not a total loser and could maybe look for a redemption at the Philly Marathon, knowing it would be a higher guarantee of cold temps (my preference). So I signed up!


May - Early July I continued to run 6 days a week, sticking around 30-35 MPW with at least one day of speedwork. Long runs did not exceed 12 miles. This felt easy, no issues, no injury. Kept up with strength training.


July kicked off an 18 week program. I used Daniel's running formula and came up with a program using his charts of 2 quality sessions + easy runs. In retrospect, I should have used another 4-6 weeks to build up my base further to the 40s MPW and then started with the 2Q sessions. It was overload to jump straight into speed work + increased mileage. And I burned out towards the end of the program.


In the end, I was able to hit 36-42 MPW for the full 18 weeks, with a down week every 4-5 weeks. My longest runs were 2 18 mile runs with some pace work. Unfortunately I traveled and then was hit with a sickness in the final weeks of training so I missed my peak week and did not get a final long run in. My last long run ended up being 5 weeks prior to the race.


I developed some Achilles tendonitis and plantar fasciitis in my right leg in the last 7 weeks. Was able to manage the tendonitis with PT work, but was worried about my arch holding up as I was dealing with pretty constant pain.


Although I didn't hit the volumes I had planned for (wanted to build up to 50 MPW) I was quite happy with my training and kept reminding myself I had done probably twice as much work as during my first cycle, and that surely would pay off. I ran close to 1,500 miles in the year between marathon #1 & #2.


Additionally, during this cycle, I was resolved to listen to my body first and foremost - when it screamed for rest I listened, no matter what the schedule said (something I've historically been bad at doing)


During training I had done my MP work at an 8:45 pace. But I realized that was most likely too ambitious based on the fact those runs did not feel particularly ""easy"". My #1 priority was to enjoy this run and not burn out early. So I threw away any goal I had in mind. I decided just as I had done during my HM with lots of success, that I would go by HR and see where it takes me. I anticipated I may end around 4:05-4:10 which I was fine with. Sub-4 was a nice thought but I refused to let an arbitrary goal force me to overplay my hand early.


### Pre-race


Stuffed myself with carbs in days leading up. Lots of water and electrolytes.


Woke up at 4:20am to have oatmeal/banana/coffee and use the bathroom. Walked over at 5:45am. Security was a breeze. Hung out in a warm tent until 6:20. Then went to the porta potties. Lines were 150 people long for maybe 15 porta potties!! Many guys started going to pee behind the porta potties. It was now 6:50am with no end in sight. So...I, a woman, joined the guys, wrapped myself in my space blanket and popped a squat. Gotta do what you gotta do!!


### Race


Weather was absolutely perfect. High 30s to start and low 50s to end. No wind. Sunshine. Couldn't have asked for better conditions.


I brought my handheld which was a life saver as the water stations were sometimes a bit far apart and pretty disorganized. Was able to dump a few cups of NUUN water at each stop, constantly drinking the entire way. Probably took in 64 oz of water at least. Had about 6 huma gels I think. Half a pack every 2-2.5 miles starting at mile 3. 


To start, I ended up about 20 ft behind the 4:00 pacer. Thought I'd just keep an eye on them in the first few miles while I warm up and decide later if I could catch up. I lost sight of them within about 1 mile 😂 so much for that.


Mile 1-7.5 focus was on HR sub 160. Kept it easy peasy, no problems. GPS was a bit off so I wasn't clear on my pace, seemed to be in the 9:15 range. Told myself ok, no sub-4 today, so just enjoy it!


7.5-14 was the hilly portion of the marathon so I knew I had to be conservative here to not blow up later. Made sure to take the hills easy and make up ground on the down hill. Went smoothly, HR still sub ~162.


I hit mile 13.1 at the 1:59:45 mark, to my surprise. Sub-4 in the books after all then?? That got me fired up, as I felt still super great and not fatigued at all and knew the rest of the course would be pretty flat.But told myself to keep my emotions in check and stick to the plan. We're only halfway!


Mile 14-20 was a long, pretty flat out & back. This was my chance to shine. Settle in, add a little gas (not too much!) and let's get it. I let me HR climb to 165-172 range. Felt great. Was fun seeing the pro runners coming back already towards me. So fast!


Mile 17, I look up, and it's none other than the 4:00 pacer! I had caught up! This is it. I decided to stick to them for the next ~5 miles to pace. Since I had started after them, as long as I stick to them I'll be good with hitting sub 4. This part was a bit frustrating as the crew following the pacers was quite large and the road narrow, so was doing a lot of dodging to try and stay in the pack. I was also confused on how I hit the half marathon mark at a 4:00 pace but was only seeing the pacers now?


Mile 20 was the turnaround to the out & back. Amazing fun crowd. I still felt good! But reminded myself it's just beginning.


Mile 21.5 I decided to pass the 4:00 pacers. I felt tired but good and wanted to get out of the crowd. 


Mile 22.5 things were starting to hurt, bad. Plus the course was a bit long so it was mentally and tough to see my watch at 23 miles knowing technically I was only at 22.5


Mile 23 legs dying, so thirsty, my airpods die. I throw them in the case for the next mile and just tell myself you make it through this and your reward is your fave songs in the last 2 miles to get you to the end. Kept checking back to make sure the pacers weren't catching up, couldn't see them from my quick glances.


Mile 24-26.2 (technically 26.7), crowds are roaring, I'm in full grimace-try-not-to-cry horrible pain. Telling myself slowing down or stopping will only make things worse, just get it done. 


I started getting worried when I was close to the end and my watch read around 3:57. I thought oh shit this course might be long enough that I could still miss the 4:00 cut off! So I put the gas on in the last leg. Absolutely everything I had left.


My last mile ended up being my fastest in the low 8s!


Final time 3:58:45.


Wanted to cry of happiness, can't believe everything worked out so perfectly.


### Post-race


Hobbled out, met my friends who cheered for me at mile 6, 13, and 25.5! Went to sit in the shower for a while. Then went out to eat, got a beer before eventually heading back to our Airbnb to order in some Thai food.


Overall felt quick good outside of my legs being absolutely shot.


I'm absolutely elated. Happy with my time, but more so at having had such a fun and good time on the course! Really glad I took the leap to redeem myself from last year, got to remap my feelings towards marathons. Maybe they aren't so terrible after all!

1805,1700489372.0,intermediate marathon 18-week plan from 80/20 review,"Hi all,

Whenever I look for plans for races I try to come here for some reviews/thoughts so I thought I'd repay the favor. See below for my thoughts on the 80/20 18-week intermediate marathon plan

&#x200B;

**Me:** 

6'1 205lbs. Def fit-ish but more in terms of strength training. When I started this plan I hadn't really run in several months but have a decent running background, having completed several 10-13.1 mile runs and a half-ironman a few years prior. 

**Gear:** 

Garmin Forerunner 945. Plan completed through training peaks.

**General plan overview:**

6/days per week. 80/20 based on heart rate and time, except for long runs each week, which were distance and heart rate based. In addition, there were <5 runs that were based on distance/speed/heart rate scattered throughout. In general, there were two weeks of building followed by a recovery week (6 total cycles).

In the weeks, there is generally a long run, two speed runs, and three base runs. All runs have a 5 minute zone 1 warmup. The base runs and long runs are all done in zone 2 (long runs allow for drift up into higher zones from dehydration), and the speed workouts varied nicely, with more short burst higher zones at the beginning of the plan with the backend of the plan formulated with longer zone 3/4 efforts. I am no scientist but this seems to make sense for a marathon plan. 

**General thoughts:** 

All in all I was really happy with this plan. Having not run in the weeks leading up to the plan, I was heavily considering doing a beginner plan (5days a week, less volume), but was glad I chose this one. I never felt like any one workout was very difficult, but the training volume definitely started to get to me in the later weeks, and I missed maybe 10% of my workouts from weeks 12-15 due to various injuries. I question with my size and weight whether 5/days a week with more cross training would indeed better for my body and training. The plan makes it clear you can exchange any of the baseline runs a week for cross training efforts, but there was always this drive to do the workouts as prescribed. Additionally, there is no strength training built into the plan, and I wish I had emphasized this a bit more during the workout plan. Finally, while I did like the zone training, I did struggle with the fact that there were no benchmark runs built in. Again, I think the plan recommends that you can do these runs in place of base runs, but I did feel that my body was always tired from the training volume and that it would be difficult to incorporate these easily into my workout. 

&#x200B;

**Specific pros:**

\- Heart rate training allowed me to improve at a nice pace throughout the plan

\- With heart rate training, I never felt that one workout was particularly brutal or unachievable. For the most part, most of my runs were ""good"" runs, rather than ""bad"" runs

\- Good support material and FAQs/resources online to help answer questions and complement information regarding the 80/20 theory

\- Allowed me to achieve my goals nicely

&#x200B;

**Specific cons**

\- Perhaps too much volume for someone of my size/weight.

\- Allows user judgment for cross-training, benchmark workouts, which may not be ideal for some.

\- Perhaps an issue with all plans/smart watches, but for extremely short zone 5/6/7 efforts, my watch never caught up in terms of heart rate so you could never tell whether your efforts were appropriate or not. Generally I thought this was a very minor inconvenience. 

\- Temperature and other factors (caffeine, sleep debts) always play a role in heart rate. The plan authors argue that these changes are important for you to be aware of so that you can modify your pace and prevent injury. However, I do wonder if more of a cognitive approach using heart race and pace zones would be more intuitive than using heart rate alone. 

\- No strength training incorporated.

&#x200B;

In the end, this plan allowed me to crush my marathon goals, despite perhaps some injuries in the third quarter and other minor issues. Would highly recommend it to any runner. I also read the associated 80/20 book during the initial part of training, and while the book definitely started to drag on towards the end (we get it, you think 80/20 is better), thought it was a worthwhile read.

### Background

I've been running on and off since early 2020, but never really stuck to any consistent schedule, generally running at most once a week. I started doing it a bit more consistently in the late spring of this year and signed up for my first ever couple of races, culminating in running the SF Half Marathon (first half) in July of this year (finishing in 1:54). However, my training had solely consisted of running 1-2x a week, with one long run, and I also didn't feel like I even gave the race 100% as I was afraid of not finishing/blowing up. So I decided to do another half marathon before the end of the year and this time give it a proper treatment. Along the way I trained for a shorter race (JPMCC, 3.5 miles) as my first ever real training block (maxing at ~20mpw), which went well, so I decided to pick up a proper HM training program after that and picked the Berkeley HM as the race I'd train for.

### Training

I decided to do a slightly abridged version of a 12 week training program since I only had about ~10 weeks from the shorter race until the BHM. I found a 1:45 program on Runners' World and planned to adapt it slightly to a faster pace (as I decided I'd try to target sub 1:40) -- basically just moving all the workouts up in speed to match the real target pace. The program was meant to ramp up to around 40mpw at its peak on week 10, though I never reached that and actually spent most of the training plan at much lower volume. Since I only had 10 weeks I planned to basically just start on week 4 of the plan which would leave me some wiggle room to slot in an extra week depending how training went. 

However almost immediately things didn't go to plan. 

Week 1's speed workouts were fine, but I decided not to do the ""easy"" runs as I felt ramping the volume too fast would be an issue. The week was supposed to end with a 10K time trial, which I attempted, but it was on a trail (was traveling and was the only thing available) and I got lost a few times so I didn't end up actually running 10K fast.

Week 2 I was back home and was determined to complete a proper , but I'd do 8x1k intervals as I read that's better for HM training vs the shorter interval work recommended in the RW plan. This actually went great and I felt really good, but alas, disaster struck -- I came down with covid immediately afterward (started feeling sick that day). I took the rest of the week off as I felt absolutely miserable. My symptoms largely went away by the end of the weekend of that week, but the next week (3) I had severe fatigue and only managed to run 2 short easy runs. At this point it was 3 weeks into my supposed 10 week training block and I'd manage to run a grand total of 30 miles when I was supposed be doing more than that *per week* by then... however, I resolved I'd jump back in and make the best of it as I felt fine at the start of the next week & my first interval workout was strong (thankfully no loss of fitness from covid).

Weeks 4-8 were my ""real training block"", where I did 30+ miles every week and maxed at 37 miles on week 8. I was very loosely following the RW guide at this point, but trying to ensure I did at least 1x intervals, 1x tempo, and 1x long run every week, and getting 4-5 running days per week. The very fast ramp up to 30mpw had a bunch of side effects for me -- I had difficulty sleeping, felt high levels of fatigue throughout the day, and easy runs were leaving me very sore (worse than some faster runs). I was lifting 3x a week as well which probably contributed. However, I was hitting my paces on intervals, tempos were going fine, etc so I kept at it. I figured out some form tweaks that improved my easy running and by the end of the 3rd week I got used to the volume. The original plan had some weird things like a 13.1 mile time trial 4 weeks out from the race which I disregarded and decided to just do long runs w/ either portions at goal pace or with a ""moderate pace"" + fast finish. All this culminated in a very successful peak week of full training (planned a 2 week taper), with a 13.5M run that felt great and set a new HM PB of 1:43 (according to Strava). 

Unfortunately, I got sick the day after my last long run with what turned out to be a very stubborn cold. I only managed 2 short-ish runs the first week of my taper, and the 2nd run left me with massive sinus pain that lasted a full 24 hours, which scared me off running for several days. I was still feeling sick on and off through the Friday of the following week so I was getting anxious I wouldn't be healthy in time for the race. After all the pains and struggles, it would've been a real shame to have this ruin my HM attempt. Miraculously I woke up fully feeling better on the Saturday -- 1 day before the race. I decided I'd go ahead with my goal pace (which was to run a ""flat 7:20 pace"", i.e. equivalent flat pace when accounting for hills).

### Pre-race

I was in the throes of still feeling somewhat sick until the day before the race so I didn't put a lot of attention to pre-race nutrition (usually like to carboload a couple days beforehand), but I did make sure to eat a lighter meal the night before and keep the alcohol to a minimum (had a friendsgiving event). I decided to go to bed early but I was too pumped about the race and could barely sleep -- I think I ended up getting 4 hours total over the course of the night. Due to my light meal, I actually started feeling rather hungry in the middle of the night so I made myself some buttered toast and had a banana in the midst of my insomnia -- figured it'd be safer to start digesting 6-7 hours before the 7:30am race time vs eating after my final planned 5:30am wakeup.

I got up in time, took a hot shower and got ready for the race. I brought an old swag hoodie as a throwaway since the forecast was looking very cold (45 degrees at the start line at race start) and got an Uber to the race start line as I didn't know what the parking situation would be like (in hindsight there was tons of parking and I could've easily driven -- oh well lesson learned). I ended up arriving at 6:55am as they'd said the corrals would be closing 15 minutes before race start, though this turned out to be a lie and no one really even enforced the corrals. It was super cold, definitely felt like it was in the 40s -- everyone was doing short jogs to try to keep warm. The race start area was pretty well organized and since the race wasn't huge it was fairly compact. I didn't really need to do anything though so I just wandered about aimlessly until I decided to go to my corral.

I was in corral A (the first one) as I'd indicated an estimate time of 1:40 (no mistakes unlike some previous races where things had gone less well..). Since I'd been in the corral so early, I ended up right near the front of the overall group and a few minutes before race start realized that I was in fact in *front* of the 1:25 pacer -- way ahead of my intended target! At this point the national anthem started playing so it was too late to move around, so I decided to stick with that position. The anthem ended, the announcer counted down and the race was off!

### Race

I'd been afraid of going out too fast so I tried to restrain myself and stick to my original goal pace for the first mile. I let the 1:25 and 1:30 pacers get by me and go at a slower rate than them since I knew that would be way too fast for me to sustain. However, I ended up still going quite a bit faster than goal pace since I was surrounded by a lot of much faster people. The 1:35 pacers didn't catch up to me for a while and when they did I decided to stick with them instead of falling back further.

I was planning to pace myself by using a set of pre-determined ""segments"" -- the race had a lot of uphills & downhills and I'd computed the right ""estimated pace"" for each overall uphill or overall downhill segment. This had seemed like it'd be an easy way to follow along but it proved a bit more difficult in practice since the actual contours/hills I ran into weren't exactly what I'd expected and I also forgot to switch segments on my watch at the right intervals, leading to distances that didn't quite match what I had expected the uphills/downhills to be. Nonetheless, it was clear I was exceeding my goal paces in the opening phases -- faster on both the uphills & downhills -- but I felt good so I kept up with the 1:35 pacers. I was hitting 7:40 or lower on up hills I planned to hit 8:10 but again it all felt good and my HR wasn't crazy so I kept it up through the UC Berkeley campus and hills after that.

The route reached its peak elevation at around mile 4.5 after a series of grueling hills (totaling >400ft of elevation gain), before starting a long descent. At this point I passed the 1:35 pacers and flew down the long downhill significantly faster than my goal pace (watch was reading 6:50 most of the way -- goal was 7), despite their warnings that I should conserve some energy since the last 2.5 miles of the race are steadily uphill. It started to feel a bit tougher as the downhill flattened out but I was still feeling pretty strong so I kept going fast - I was well ahead of the 1:35 pacers but surrounded by a stable group of runners so we kept together for a while. I grabbed a couple cups of water but had a lot of trouble drinking them, not sure if I ended up getting much swallowed.

Around mile 7.5, the race went over a highway overpass -- the first hill in a long time -- and ended up on a long flat stretch right by the water (on the bay), where on the way out you stay on the left side, do a turnaround and then come back on the other side. I started a new segment and was feeling strong -- my pace on my watch was 7:09 and it felt fairly sustainable. Eventually there was a turnaround, and I flipped direction, only to realize that I'd been riding a strong tailwind the entire way out and I was now directly in the face of the wind! My pace immediately dropped and it felt like a huge struggle - I started to feel like the last 4 miles were going to be really tough. I found a runner going at approximately the pace I wanted to go and decided to draft him, which worked reasonably well (at least as a psychological pacer, if not any actual aerodynamic advantage). I passed the 10 mile marker at just over 72 minutes -- a 4 minute PR for me -- and made it back to the highway overpass to return to the last few miles of the race.

At this point the finishing uphill the 1:35 pacers had warned me about arrived -- first the overpass, then a steady uphill to the finish line. I started really flagging at this point -- my legs felt like they were running out of energy and the steps were hurting. I felt myself slowing down. Shortly after that, I saw the 1:35 pacers pass me and realized I wouldn't be able to catch them. Every step was getting painful, but I still had over 2 miles to go (hadn't yet seen the 11 mile marker) --  I wasn't sure if I would be able to keep any reasonable pace at all for the end. I struggled through most of the 12th mile, desperately clinging on to the best pace I could manage. My watch was showing a 7:44 pace at this point for my latest segment, and slowing, which was basically the slowest number I'd seen on any segment so far. My legs

At about mile 11.5 I looked at my total time and realized that I was way ahead of my goal time and if I could just scrape 1.5 miles together I would be easily able to beat my original goals. This got me motivated and I started to push through, though I was deep in the pain cave at this point.  I kept thinking, just another mile, just another .75 miles, just another 800m, etc, til I finally saw the finish line in the distance and gave it one last final push and sped up. Crossed the line at 1:35:xx!


### Post-race

As soon as I stopped I realized how much pain I was in, especially the quads. Also realized I desperately needed to pee (somehow had felt 0 of that in my running but immediately hit me as soon as I stopped) so booked it to a nearby portapottie and met my girlfriend and friend near the finish line who had come out to cheer me on. They'd apparently taken a video of me near the 12 mile marker which showed just how much of a struggle bus I was on -- amusing :). We took some pictures and I collected various swag items from the fair. It was really cold still (despite being sunny) so we went to a nearby brunch place instead of hanging out at the finish line festival. Demolished a breakfast burrito and went back home to be horizontal for the rest of the day (while of course relishing my Strava kudos as they came in).

My watch had underreported the race distance so it turned out that all the paces I saw on my watch were actually underestimates. I ran the race with an absolute positive split (around 75 seconds delta between the first 6.55 vs last 6.55), which would be even more severe if grade adjusted since the first half was actually the more difficult half with most of the total elevation gain. I know the guidance is to run even or slightly negative splits, but I think I would've never gotten anywhere close to as good of a time if I had taken it easier in the start so I was pretty happy. My slowest segment was miles 12 & 13, but even these were actually at my original goal pace. One thing I did wonder is a caffeine/carb hit mid race could've kept up my energy for the last bit but overall no regrets -- my stomach felt fine all race and I kept up a decent pace to the end.

Next up I'm probably going to sign up for a full marathon sometime next year but for now this is a good enough accomplishment for 2023!

1807,1700407653.0,Did Salomon ruin Spikecross? + further discussion about spikey shoes,"I'm from Northern Europe, and winter is 2/3 of the year here. It gets to -30 to -20 Celcius.

I usually invest into winter running shoes, and I've been running with Spikecross 3 for at least 7 years. Now they're worn down, and I thought of Spikecross 6.

I noticed Salomon has moved the spikes to the \_edges\_ of the shoes, and there's only 1 spike under  the ball of the foot, where weight will actually land. Ice here is not soft, but hard and doesn't push down, so I'm afraid the spikes on the edges will not prevent me from slipping. There's one spike in the front, and compared to the Spikecross 3, it's much more in the front than before, in a spot that wouldn't have weight on it.

In Spikecross 6, they added spikes to a part of the shoe in the middle. In my 4 year old shoes, the shoe bottom still has the pattern in that spot, that hasn't worn down at all, so it isn't a spot that would really touch the ground.

What would be Salomon's reasoning here..? Has anyone tried Spikecross 6 and can actually compare?

I'm frustrated with how little spikey shoes there are, and using added spikes to normal shoes just isn't enough in these conditions. Only if you run quite slow and in monotonous, even ground, like a road. I'm so frustrated that Salomon seems to have ruined Spikecross shoes. I've been trying to find good spikey shoes for 2 months now, and every shoe that I try, is either incredibly loose around my foot or is just designed for easy road running.

This is a serious issue, because living in the climate I live in, it's not an option to just run inside for half a year or run on days with no ice, because for the next 6 months, there's not going to be warm days.",running

Welcome.

### Training Foci

I signed up for this half a few days after completing my *first* HM in April of this year. My finish time then was 1:47:53, which I’d done on the back of 5 **total** months of running experience, and basically no structured training at all. I was proud of the time then, and still am now, but after that race, I realized I *hadn’t* raced that race, I’d only run it. I started that HM running far faster than I was capable of sustaining, and while my pace at the beginning of the HM was in the 7:40s, my pace at the end was in the 8:40s. I also felt like I had more at the end of the race — I knew that for my next race, I would have the goal of knowing I left 100% of my ability “on the field,” so to speak.

I spent the summer after that race building up to ~38 mpw consistently, with a couple peaks in the 40s, which coincided with starting to slow down my pace (I’d never run during the summer before), and **genuinely** try to improve my Z2 aerobic fitness. While in January and February I’d been running at 8:30 paces on average, during the summer I was slowing down to the 9:40s, all the way into the 10 & 11:00s during the hottest, most humid days. I did not do any speed-work over the summer; long, easy miles (and lots of them) were the goal. My average heart rate on 3/10-effort runs dropped from ~168 bpm in April down to ~138 bpm in October. 

In September, I signed up for the Runna app, which I route through my Apple Watch, and started using it to train for Philly. I knew very early on that I wanted a big PB. Since April, my running had coincided with losing about 40 lbs (from ~235 in April to ~190, a low of 185 in October), and so I thought my effort would be getting me considerably further now. In addition, I really took to the speedwork sessions presented by Runna, and could feel the upper “gears” in my register really starting to open up. Because of that, after 1 tempo run where I held 7:30 pace for 2 kilometers, I decided: **I wanted to go for a sub-1:40.**

I trained 6 days each week (running’s a pretty important mental health thing for me, so consistency helps), and only missed 2 total runs in training (both of them easy runs). I bike ~20 minutes to work with my daughter on the bike each way, so I always have ~40 minutes of aerobic stress on my body each day — and a conflagration of life stuff meant that even outside of work, mostly me (rather than my wife) preoccupied our 6 year old after school each day. Being as consistent as I was with training is something I’m incredibly proud of, and I’m **confident** I wouldn’t have had the success I did if I’d taken days off. The majority of my runs during this block were run between 4:45 and 6:00 am. 

### Race
From mile 1 all the way until mile 8, my main thought was “This isn’t hard. **Training** was hard; this is just fun.” I thought to myself: “You don’t have to do this; you *get* to do this.” The energy was incredible. This was my first event with 2k+ people, and it was just incredible to be a part of. If I could do the event any justice in describing it, I wouldn’t need to run; but it’s just one of those totally non-representable things for me, in its purity. It was just **good**. I think I’ve gone off-topic.

Crossing the Windy Bridge (not sure what it’s called in real life, but sure as **fuck** was that bridge Windy) signaled the transition of the race from Fun to Hard; it was a crystal clear demarcating line. I still felt strong after mile 8, but the toll of running 8 consecutive miles at a 7:30 split was taking a toll on me (I’d never done that before!). This part of the race also featured the majority of the race’s elevation changes. As a larger runner (and, in my opinion, probably the least-fit-looking of the runners around whom I finished), ups-and-downs kind of kick my ass; gravity has it out for me. But I kept on; I noticed one of my splits had a 7:40 mile in there, and even though I *knew* it was uphill, and toward the end of the race, I remembered: *If I run 7:40 splits the whole time, I won’t get sub-1:40.* I knew at that point that a -1:40 was still totally possible, but I needed to **maintain**.

So for the rest of the race, I was back to a modified version of my earlier mantra: “You **have** to do this, because you get to do this.” I remembered a runner in a wheelchair I’d passed earlier; I’ve been thinking about mortality a lot lately, as my wife is pregnant with our second, and thought about the gift it is to be young, able-bodied, *running*. So I dug deep, and pushed whenever I could, still mentally holding back that **very** last little bit of *push* for the finish. But this part was really, really hard; I had to remind myself to smile, which hadn’t been true at the start of the race. And I lost focus on trying to “pick off” runners around me, which signaled a turning-inwards of my attention in a way that felt more foreboding than anything. So I would try and focus on things around me to hold my attention, off of checking my watch, or focusing on the gentle-but-increasing burn of the throb of tired muscles, holding, solid as a rock, to that 7:30 pace. 

Then I saw the crowd thicken, and saw a statue that **had** to signal something important, and I realized that This Was It, there was nowhere left to push if not right here. A, frankly, *stunning* woman in the crowd found my eyes and said specifically to me, “Run, you can do it!” Which, I mean, right there, that’s maybe where the PB came from. And I huffed and puffed myself across that mat, and paused my watch. 1:38; hell yeah. Texts from my wife and family poured in congratulating me; and after some calls, I waddled back to the apartment. I split the rest of my day between taking pics around Philly, and eating a big-ass edible in my AirBNB and sleeping for 16 hours. I was worried, before the race, that if I got a sub 1:40 that I’d break down crying at the finish line; I was pleased to find instead that I **just** felt happy, and proud, in a simple way, like I haven’t felt in years, and I couldn’t shake the feeling for about 35 minutes. It was really pretty great.

### What I Did Well

1 - I stopped losing weight. When I started the training block, I was around 190, and had lost that prior weight precipitously. I realized after one particularly challenging long run that training at an energy deficit was going to make me feel and perform like shit. So I started eating a LOT more — honestly, largely in an unstructured, calories-first kind of way. An **easy** “grow” for next race would be to be more particular about macros and fueling than I was, but for the level of experience I started at, I’m proud of my results here. Being fueled up also directly contributed to success via the next strength of

2 - Consistency in training. As mentioned, I attempted 70/72 prescribed runs during the block, and the 2 that I missed were easy day runs, where I’d already done 40 minutes of biking. I was truly fortunate enough to not get sick during training, but there were **numerous** days where I went out, felt like shit, fell short of the workout target, and kept chugging along anyway; I think those days are probably more contributory to my success than the days where I felt great; because by the end of the race, I *knew* what it felt like to feel like crap and try to run your hardest anyway — and that **definitely** described miles 10-13 of the race, for me.

### Next Steps & Improvements

1 - Continue losing weight. Now that I’m not training for a race any more, I aim to drop speed workouts, keep tempo runs, and up my milage to around ~45 mpw consistently, and then see where the spirit leads re: spring races. While I’m doing that, I’m going to throttle back on some of the “easier” cals (read: candy) and try to drop down to ~180 flat. I’ve never been that weight before; it’d be interesting. By the end of running Philly, I **definitely** felt the effect of my weight on my legs. My legs are visibly, incredibly strong, but because I *am* heavy, I remember cresting one specific hill and feeling my leg do a weak little wobble, and thinking, “It’s not an endurance thing, it’s becoming a *strength* thing.” So, yeah — prioritize reducing my contributing weight / dead weight ratio. 

2 - More Miles = More Fun. I’ve never hit 50 in a week, and I think that by dropping interval work and replacing it with long, easy runs, with tempo miles injected in the middle — basically burying the workout inside a Z2 run — I’ll be able to hit 50, and then see if I can maintain it. But I’ll need some weeks to rest my legs up — when I say I met the goal of not leaving anything on the table, I’m basically limping around my apartment. I realized I was 5 seconds above being below the minute barrier of my time, and thought to myself: “Couldn’t you have found 5 seconds in there *somewhere*, buddy?” But actually, reflecting on it now, my honest answer is, **no**. I *raced* my whole heart & ass out during the race, and couldn’t, with my current level of fitness, have done any better. Which means that the only thing to do next is do it again, but with a better level of fitness. Onwards.

1813,1700372819.0,Best Method for Shoe Measurements,"Hello everyone, I'm planning to get a max cushioning shoe for me and my wife, I wanted to know which method is the most reliable for shoe measurements?

From what I've generally read and looked into, there's two general way:

1. Wearing the shoe, and it should have a thumb-length gap of free space from the tip of your longest feet (could be your toe)

2. Taking the insole out, and putting your foot on it and it should have a thumb-length gap of free space from the tip of your longest feet (could be your toe)

Context: I'm a fairly new runner that's jumping back into running after a year of hiatus. I bought a Nike Pegasus 40 a few months back (size UK10.5) and I've just noticed the sizing is confusing. With the shoes on, there's around 1-1.25 thumb-length gap in front, whereas if I measure it with my foot against the insole it's around 1.5-2 thumb-length gap. Does this means the shoe is too big for me? I am starting to feel like it's bigger, compared to when I tried it in store.

Bonus context: I also kept getting shin splints, more frequently lately. Is this due to the shoe being a tad big for me? (I also do weightlifting on alternate days that also targets the lower leg region)

|------|------|

### Training
This was my third marathon: I ran one about a dozen years ago in 5:23, then Philly last year in 5:25 (frustratingly close to a PR).

Training went better this year. When the plan I was following called for 20-mile runs last year, I could only get to 15-16. But this year, I completed two 20-milers. So my hopes for improvement in the race were high.

### Pre-race
My over-excited brain woke me at 3:45 a.m., and I couldn't get back to sleep. I was really anticipating a great race, since weather conditions were forecast to be perfect (high 30s at the start, mid 50s at the end).

Fortunately, the security check to get into the starting area went much quicker this year; no long line (perhaps because I arrived as the first wave was starting).

One nit to pick with the announcer: he kept saying ""And now the next wave is about to begin,"" but he usually didn't identify which wave it was. It would have been helpful for runners in the final corral (like me) to know how many more waves we needed to wait for.

### Race
I set off at my typical low-10s pace. I maintained a similar pace for much of last year's race, but due to chronic stomach issues (IBS), I made precautionary stops at about 12 out of the 13 port-a-potty stations, which led to my 5:25 finish. This year, since my tummy felt pretty good, I chose to bypass a few more, which really helped my time. But I was making my final pre-race potty stop when my wave began, so I ended up crossing the starting line several minutes after almost everyone else was gone. It was easy to pass the very tail-enders, but soon I reached clogged parts of the city streets, where it was hard to weave through traffic.

(Sorry to be toilet-obsessed, but a big failure on the organizers' part was to have too few potties and to have many of them run out of paper long before the race ended. I spent 10 minutes standing in one line, which knocked me way off pace; I figure 1,000 runners passed while I stood there. And then to find that the paper hadn't been replenished ....)

Early on, it became clear that I'd smash my PR if I didn't have a serious breakdown. In fact, I caught the 5:00 pace group around the 19-mile mark -- sadly, just when I was going to make another pit stop. I didn't see them again.

However, in my tired-brain condition, I finally realized that I didn't *have* to cross before the 5:00 pace group, because I'd started several minutes behind them! So there was still hope of hitting my huge reach goal.

Today was proof of the adage that the halfway point of a marathon comes at 20 miles. The first 10 went wonderfully well, and the next 10 went reasonably well ... except that shortly before 20 miles, I started feeling pain with every stride of my left leg. It felt like a hip flexor. I stopped to stretch a few times, which provided little relief. So I spent the last 10K alternating running for a minute or so and then walking for about half a minute, until my hip felt like it could run a bit more.

When I reached the 5K-to-go point, I knew that if I ran at my typical 5K training speed, I'd hit the line right around 5:00. I tried to summon a final long burst, but the hip just wouldn't cooperate; I had to keep running/walking.

I ended up crossing at about 5:04. That knocked nearly 20 minutes off my PR, which delights me! And I'm not really that bummed about missing a good chance for sub-5:00. Stuff happens.

### Post-race
My wife was waiting near the finish to congratulate me, which made a lot of the pain worthwhile. She was wonderfully supportive all through my training and the race, though I don't think she really understood why I'd subject myself to this process. Afterward, though, she said it was cool that people of all ages and body types could participate in something like this together.

Last year, I finished ahead of about 22% of guys in my age group, so I set a goal to beat 25% of them this year. I figured my time was so much faster that I'd probably succeeded. Just now, though, I looked at the results ... and discovered that I'd beaten about 24.7%. The fine weather must have aided everyone else too! And no, I'm not going to round that decimal up to 25. ;-)

I'm pretty sure that's my last full marathon. The amount of training required is just absurd. Those 20-mile training runs took me half a day! And the hip issue was a reminder that my aging and sometimes fragile body probably isn't well suited for such extreme amounts of exercise. I'll keep running shorter workouts and races, and next summer I hope to do some duathlons, as biking is my alternate training activity.

I hope everyone else who ran Philly today enjoyed the weather and a good outcome!

# Training

First half, first major race after HS, second major road race. 

Last April, I ran the Broad Street Run (10 mile), and had a lot of fun doing it, so towards the end of my HS track season I decided to focus on road races in college. Had this race on my radar probably since May of this year. 

When I ran the Broad Street my training consisted of track-oriented workouts, usually with a more threshold-oriented session (e.g. 6-8 x 800 @ \~5k) and a more speed-oriented session every week, with meets on weekends (aka. no long runs). 

Started to really build mileage late-July, with the goal of hitting around 45-50 MPW (6 day weeks). During the summer I was largely training alone, although since I was mainly in a build phase it wasn't too bad of a slog. The only real difference between the build this time vs. building for HS xc was the introduction of steady-state runs (ty RunnersWorld) to try and get some extra aerobic stimulus. 

Starting college in the fall, I joined the club team, and as a result had people to run with (always very nice), but due to scheduling I could usually only make \~2 practices a week. Training usually consisted of a threshold session on Tuesdays on the track, some sort of improvised fartlek/tempo/steady on Thursdays, and LR Saturday. Eventually the Thursday workouts became less consistent because waking up and trying to hop into a workout is not fun, especially alone. As for the workouts themselves, the main difference was that the club workouts largely used jogging rest over the standing rest in HS, which helped to build my aerobic baes even more. I didn't really notice the effect until I did a workout with standing rest and realized how fast I recovered from each rep. 

Sprinkled within the training were 2 club xc races (both 8k), which I basically just trained through (terrible idea, legs were absolutely shot on both of them and the waterslide course conditions only contributed to that fact). The first 8k also made me realize that I had been neglecting to do my standard lifting (aka. stability/core/light high rep lower body stuff 1x/week) routine, so I had to get back on track doing that. Additionally, during this time my body was getting used to being consistent 40+ mile weeks so I dealt with quite a bit of calf/achilles soreness. 

Additionally, I raced a road 5k 4 weeks out from the half (reduced mileage a bit like 3 days before), and picked up a PR, but definitely necessarily feel as fit as I had hoped. The week after the 5k I did my longest run of the training block (14), and was feeling confident in my abilities to hammer the half. 

Then, the only real setback in the entire training block, I got the flu 2 weeks out from the race, so had to skip a long run and was out for 3 days, as well as having to reduce my workout volume quite a bit for a few days after. However, by this point I was already starting to bring my total mileage down so it wasn't too big of an issue. 

Overall I think my body responded pretty well to the training, mostly just had to give it some time to adjust to the mileage and the threshold sessions fell into place pretty well. I think it definitely helped that in HS I was a more aerobically based runner and responded well to tempo/threshold work.

# Pre-race

I dropped my mileage quite a bit a week out, and did a 3.5 mile race-pace session on the track on Tuesday to get a feel for the pace. Tbh my ""half pace"" was just a complete shot in the dark based off what I had run at Broad Street and trying to adjust for the harder course (but also increased fitness). 

I also began to consciously shift my diet to more carbs 2 days out, and went to a fun little club pasta dinner the night before. Also ran to the expo and back as my shakeout the day before the race and had fun trying to dodge people running down Chestnut Street (also definitely didn't put the wrong address into google maps in the process)

Also took 200 mg of caffeine the morning of (I usually have no caffeine), so was absolutely hyper and jittery. One of my clubmates said that I talked more to him waiting in the bathroom line then I had all year thus far  


# Race

Had a fun time waking up at 4:30 am (I am a college student and this is not normal behavior here). Was with some people from the club team who were also running

Glad I got there at around 5:55 (race started at 7:00) since apparently the security lines were really bad later on. Didn't stop the bathroom line from being 15 mins but we got there in the end  
  
Miles 1-4: A bit chaotic off the start but eventually managed to find a pack running \~6:00 pace, settled in behind this random guy (shoutout to you Jose aka. maroon singlet man) who was very encouraging. Course was pretty wet from the rain the night before but was just trying to find a rhythm for these couple miles. Also failed miserably at trying to get water at the water station and ended up spilling a bunch of nuun lemon-lime electrolyte drink all over myself (this becomes a theme throughout the race)

Miles 4-8: Going into the race I didn't realize that this entire stretch was very gradually uphill, and I realized at around mile 6 that my legs were starting to get a bit heavy. Then running up the walnut street bridge I really began to feel the lactic building in my legs, and at this point I was lowkey panicking a bit mentally but just kept pushing  
  
Miles 8-10: Literally in the depths of hell mentally with two large hills at miles 8 and 10, at this point my form was starting to break down and I had fully detached from the pack, and was just trying to hold on for dear life. My bib also ripped a bit so it was hanging on by 3 pins with the top-left corner free, so just tried to not let it bother me too much and used the drink stations to try and stick it to my wet singlet (this did not work) 

Miles 10-13.1: Luckily at this point the entire course was mostly downhill/flat, but also entering fairmount park there were way less spectators so it was a pretty big slog. Also began to realize significant pain in both of my big toenails, and after the race I found out that they were both covered in blood (still not really sure where exactly the wound is but I'm pretty sure it's a combo of under and around the toenail). Sun also started to beam down at around mile 12 and I was starting to overheat really bad, ended up pouring like 4 cups of water all over myself just to try and cool down. The last \~2 miles or so was probably the worst pain I've been in out of my entire running career (including the time I blacked out after running the 800). Either way, managed to push all the way to the finish and snag a sub 1:21. 

Per my watch, avg HR was 176, but really it was just in the 177-182 range for miles 1-finish  


# Post-race

Very interesting experience. Didn't really realize the pain in my big toes until I sat down in the warming tent and took my shoes off and realized my socks were soaked in blood, went to the first aid tent, then got directed to the main medical tent which meant I had to try and fight the thousands of people finishing because it was right next to the finish line (first-aid was like past all the medals and stuff). After a while just gave up and figured it would be faster to uber back to my dorm and try to wash up, but due to road closures had to hobble my way like 3 blocks away (couldn't walk properly since any pressure on my toe would lead to significant pain). 

Looking back now I probably should have trimmed my toenails since I think the way the alphafly upper tapers at the toe was pushing on my toenail and it was causing it to bruise, which eventually broke. 

Ended up picking up 7th in the 16-19 age group, and happy with the time. Obviously a lot of things to learn, but a fun time. Excited to watch some of my clubmates/former teacher crush it in the marathon tomorrow",running

### Training
I was invited by The Running Channel to try and beat my 10K PB. When I enrolled my time for 10k was 1:06:59. I'm not from the UK, so I made a weekend trip to London for this event. I spend friday morning on the Eurostar and then walked around the British Museum and the Natural History Museum. I did around 17k steps that day. My training hadn't gone as I had wanted it, due to circumstances beyond my control, sadly. When I initially signed up I put in that I wanted to run a sub hour 10k; however I knew this was going to be impossible. I ran a 10k race the week before and crashed at 7k and eventually finished in 1:09. Not a great confidence booster. 

### Pre-race
I arrived at the Olympic park an hour before and was in slight panic as I saw a lot of people running. Did I miss it? No, there was another race going on, luckily. 

I grabbed a coffee and the Running Channel presenters started to arrive and set things up. 
This event was sponsored by Puma, and we were given a brand new outfit. Shorts, shirt, socks and (!) brand new shoes. I got the Puma Deviate Nitro 2. My first pair of ""super"" shoes. 
After some warming up (guided by the lovely Andry Baddeley) and then we were assigned our pacers. There were pacers for 1h and 1h10. I was hoping for a 1h05 so I started behind the 1h. 

### Race
We set off with a lot of cheers from the crowd. The course was 4 laps around the olympic park and included a 'nasty' bridge. Right before the start I met a lovely fellow runner who was aiming around the same time. We decided to run together; but she set off like a rocket and I never saw her again until the finish! 
By the first lap, I was running pretty much alone, but because of the way the course was I passed a lot of faster runners and got encouragement and high fives. Awesome.

 Second lap I settled into the rhythm and kept a steady pace and thought I could make the 1:05. Grabbed a bottle of water and started lap 3. This was the hardest one. Because I had previously crashed around 7k, I was feeling hesitant about it. 
I slowed down a bit and was caught by two lovely girls whose plan was to ""survive"". We ran together for a bit but then I left them behind. 

Last lap started and I felt pretty strong. Was it the new shoes? The crowd? The perfect weather? Maybe all of the above. I picked up the pace again. I saw two runners in front of me and wanted to catch them. Afraid of burning myself I only set off after them in the last kilometer. 
I managed to pass them both. Tried to encourage them to stick with me, but they couldn't. Put in a sprint for the last two hundred meters or so and was met with a lovely cheering crowd of all the runners that had already finished. 

### Post-race
So, did I PB? I didn't know right away because I had started my watch early. But, checking Strava, I got the confirmation! PB! 1:05:52. Very happy with a PB of over a minute and 4 minutes faster than the week before. Would have loved to go even faster, but I made a slight mistake with my garmin (set up just a 10k with a pace between 6:40 and 6:20 instead of setting up each km like that). 
I cheered on the runners finishing and when everyone was done, took some group pictures, some more youtube content, interviews, and some selfies with the lovely presenters of The Running Channel. 
After that I went to Kings Cross to take a shower and took the train back home in the evening. 
Overall, super happy with how it went. Met some lovely people, got a nice new kit, and got a PB and a medal! What more could you ask for! Thanks again to The Running Channel and Puma for setting this up!

### Training
This is my second ever half marathon. My first half was September 17 of this year, and I made a [prior race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/s/eiaVr0iEPi) for that event outlining my background and training. TLDR; couldn't run a mile, was never a runner, did Hal Higdon novice 2 plan and finished an half at around 2:35ish. 

I signed up for the Philly Half mostly because my friends were doing it, and it was far enough out from my Sept. half that I felt confident that I could rest, get back into training and complete the race. This time around, I decided to do Hal Higdon's intermediate 2 half plan. This involved speed work twice a week. I struggled with hitting a wall the last two miles of my first half, so I wanted to get really good at not exerting all my energy off the bat. I also repeatedly had 5ks and a 10k where I went too fast in the beginning. 

Since I didn't have 12 weeks, I did weeks 1,3,5, etc.. until I could normally increment for  8-9 weeks. A typical week routine was: Monday cross training (I did light strength work and incline walking), Tuesday was intervals at 5k pace (reps increased weekly), Wednesday 4-5 miles, Thursday 3 miles, Friday rest, Saturday half marathon paced 2-5 miles, and Sunday was long runs. I also modified the plan to allow me to do 13.1 miles on week 5. I took my easy runs easy at a ~13-13:30 min pace and did speed work at goal paces of 11:27 for half pace workouts and 9:35 for 5k intervals. I peaked at 30ish miles. I had never done regular speedwork until this training cycle since it's not really incorporated in Higdon's novice 2 program.

My setbacks during training were:
1) I didn't give myself a full week off to recover from the  first half. I took like 3 days off and went back into it. I then hit a big wall the following week, but I took 2 days off and felt totally fine after. No injuries, just fatigue.

2) I unfortunately got an infected ingrown toenail. this was right after I did peak week and a successful 13.1 mile easy run so I took two days off to recover. Since I couldn't run after getting treated, I  then did two days of rowing that equated the cardio effects of a speed workout and a longer easy run! This was awesome. I learned I really liked rowing and will be doing it in my next training cycle for cross training. I felt like I didn't really lose any fitness from this since it was after peak week and I still did cardio.

Overall, I responded really well to the speed work being incorporated into my routine  and felt quite confident that, at minimum, I could beat my prior half time. I also got sick last training cycle, so I was very grateful I wasn't sick this time around.

### Pre-race
I did a big taper the week before and I think this helped energize me a lot for race day. I also studied the elevation map and made mental notes of the big uphill sections. My prior half was only 160ish feet in elevation but this one was 320ish. So if I was going to beat my time, I needed to be strategic. I hit a walk at mile 11 last race, so I wanted to make sure I didn't do that again. I planned to do the ""Jeff Galloway method"" of walking and running intervals during big hill sessions to not burn out.

On the morning of, I had my first cup of coffee in a week (didn't do coffee or alcohol the week leading up and I'm very happy I did), and I packed Clif blok bites and the AWAKE caffeine chocolate bites. I didn't really feel too nervous and was mostly just feeling happy! 

### Race
This race went by... so fast. I feel like I spaced out for a lot of it? I'll try to remember everything that went on:

For miles 1-6, I did my best to keep even splits at a goal pace of 11:27 and I started the race with the 2:30:00 pacer. I couldn't find the pacer after a bit but I wasn't worried since I noticed the group was going pretty fast at first. Feeling pretty good! Took an AWAKE chocolate at around mile 2 and the 50mg of caffeine was awesome. I  felt really solid at the pace I was going at -- pushing myself but  not at threshold yet. These miles were pretty flat overall, too. I took a Clif blok bite every other mile or so starting mile 3 to keep my fueling up. These were great! I also walked through the water stations, which were every 2-3 miles or so.

For like 7-10, this was the tricky part. I was feeling good, but knew the uphill areas were around these miles. I ran a good chunk of it, but at the super inclined areas I walked for 30 seconds, listened to a full song, and then reassessed if I needed another 30 seconds. This was a huge lifesaver since I didn't *need* to walk immediately at each time, but it gave me a massive second wind. I was able to get through these miles with decent times since I averaged a bit under my goal of 11:27 for the first 10k of the race. At around mile 10, I forgot I had added ""circus theme music"" to my playlist and it STARTED PLAYING LOL! It reminded me I shouldn't give up since downhill glory was soon ahead.

At the end of mile 10 and beginning of mile 11, I saw the light. There was a slight uphill stretch followed by a flat road that turned into DOWNHILL FUN. I pushed through, and then proceeded to go from an 11:25 mile 10 to a 10:24 mile 11. AND I FOUND THE 2:30:00 PACER AGAIN!! But I kept running. I couldn't stop now.

I did a 10:52 mile for the final 13th, and sprinted into a 5k pace to finish off the last .1 mile. I didn't just break my former PR on tougher course, but I also beat 2:30:00 by a minute and a half!!! 

Per later analysis of my stats, I realized I spent way more time in zone 3 this time around than I did at my first half! (50% in zone 3 and 50% at threshold this time, only 30% in zone 3 and 70% at threshold last half) Also, my average HR was 3bpm lower despite double the gained elevation and a 30ish second drop in average pace.

Official chip splits:

10k - 1:10:59 and 11:25/mi
15k - 1:45:51 and 11:27/mi
20k - 2:21:32 and 11:22/mi
Finish - 2:28:23 and 11:20/mi

### Post-race
I was ecstatic. I had a track record of bonking at races since I'm new to running as of this year, but I'm glad my patience and training paid off. I am signed up for another half in spring 2024! I'm doing Hanson's beginner plan with slight modifications. I'm really excited to see what an 18 week plan can do if 8 weeks already helped a ton. I am gonna aim for a sub 2:15:00! 

I only started this year but I really love this sport and I'm excited to keep improving!

##**Bighorn 100: White Shorts Were a Choice, Huh?**

> ""Oh I thought I knew what ~~love~~ mud was 'till I met you""
> 
>  —Tom Odell
> 

On paper, Bighorn doesn't look like a particularly tough hundred miler. It has somewhere between 16,000 and 20,000 feet of climbing depending on whose watch you believe, none of the climbs are very steep, and the altitude isn't a huge concern. So why is it a Hardrock qualifying race?

In reality, there are two major factors that make this a burly course: weather and mud. Depending on the year, there can be 90°F+ heat or freezing rain (or, potentially, one and then the other). This year we seem to have gotten lucky as the highs were around 70° and only a light drizzle fell on day two. However, the mud... Dear lord, the mud.

Listen folks, I'm from the northeast. We're no strangers to [~~love~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) mud. I've done plenty of runs through the Adirondacks, the Catskills, and the Green Mountains in ""mud season."" Hell, I ran Tough Mudders before I became an ultrarunner. This was the worst mud I've ever seen, and there were miles and miles of it. Forget shoe sucking mud; this was soul sucking.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

##**The Course**

The Bighorn 100 is an out-and-back route through the (you guessed it) Bighorn Mountains in northern Wyoming. The route is remote and the trails are sparsely used by humans (Based on the amount of cow dung on the course, it does seem to be extensively used for grazing though.).

The course can be divided into three major climbs and descents, with a major aid station at the start/end of each one and many smaller ones along the way.

Of the major aid stations, Dry Fork (mile 13 and 82) and Jaws (48) are easily accessible to crews, but Sally's (30, 66) requires a long drive down a poorly maintained dirt road which had also recently experienced a landslide earlier in the summer. Needless to say, I asked my very pregnant wife to please not drive out to Sally's in the middle of the night.

##**Start to Sally's**

Much to my delight, Bighorn has a civilized start time of 9am, and I got the best night of sleep I've ever had before a race. I drove to the start with Girl Alex (the pregnant one) and Boy Alex (not pregnant). You might remember Boy Alex from his pacing gig at Fat Dog 120. This year, we decided to race each other and drag our wives along for the ride. Alex was aiming for 26 hours and I thought 28 hours might be in the cards if things went well.

I got to the back of the race field just as the starting gun sounded, which was perfect timing in my mind. I get anxious standing around before races.

The first mile was along Tongue Canyon Rd, which allowed the runners to spread out a little before being funneled onto singletrack. A few miles in, we began to climb in earnest. The first eight miles of the course would take us from the mouth of the canyon at 4,000 feet up through a forest to a broad plateau at 7,500 feet. This section would be our first taste (sometimes literally) of the mud that we would see for the next 90-something miles. Snowmelt combined with record breaking spring rainfall had saturated the soil in the Bighorn Mountains, making the conditions treacherous for runners and volunteers alike.

I tried to keep my heart rate in check as I struggled to gain a foothold in the mud, but I ultimately had to red-line a few times to stay on my feet. I had left the snow baskets on my trekking poles for extra floatation, and I made liberal use of them on this climb. After some very slow miles, we emerged above tree line and were greeted by a stunning alpine meadow.

I reached the Dry Fork Ridge aid station about 20 minutes behind my 28-hour schedule, but feeling pleased with how my lungs and legs were holding up so far. I could feel myself naturally slowing down from the altitude but thankfully didn't experience any headaches or nausea for the entire race. Alex helped me restock on food and water and sent me on my way.

We spent the next 10 miles or so traversing through more alpine meadows and muddy forests. During this stretch we passed by Kern's Cow Camp, which had been relocated from its planned site because the muddy access road was impassible to the pickup truck carrying supplies.

Random conversation I overheard in this section:

> Man: ""You know how you can tell the difference between deer poop and moose poop? If you can fit it in your nostril, it's deer poop.""
> 
> Woman, spotting a pile of large pellets: ""So that's moose poop then.""
> 
> Man: ""How can you tell? You didn't even try.""

At the end of the traverse, the course dropped more than 2,000 feet down a section that is appropriately known as The Wall. As I picked my way through a particularly wet section of The Wall, I plunged my trekking pole deep into the mud, and when I pulled it out the entire bottom segment detached. Not ideal with 75 miles of race left to run. I spent a minute looking for the missing piece but it had sunk too far down to be retrieved.

I tested out the pole and found that it still offered a little stability on firm ground but sank straight into the mud since it was now just a hollow aluminum rod. I would later have to tape the remaining segments of the pole together since the bottom piece is crucial to holding the whole thing together.

Equipment malfunctions aside, I made it down to Sally's Footbridge aid station (mile 30) in a little under 8 hours, having lost another five minutes from my anticipated splits.

##**Sally's to Jaws and Back**

Sally's will always have a special place in my heart for two reasons: First, they had a foot washing station composed of small plastic tubs of water and towels set out in front of camp chairs. This was a godsend since I had planned to change my mud-soaked socks here and needed to clean all the grit off my feet first. Second, they had a tray of McDonald's burgers at the food table. I'm not a big fan of fast food but a greasy burger hit the spot in that moment.

The next section would be an 18 mile, 4,500 foot climb through the dark. I downed a cold brew coffee, grabbed a headlamp, and stashed some warm layers in my pack. After a quick 5-minute turnaround I was back on the trail.

I quickly met up with a local runner named Mario who had done Bighorn in 2022. He warned me that there would be a treacherous river crossing coming up with just a rope strung across a deep and fast moving section of water. A few minutes later he let out a celebratory howl as he saw that there was a brand new bridge spanning that section.

At Kern's Cow Camp, an 8-year-old volunteer (Eva, I think?) was handing out Balsam Root wildflowers to all the runners. I figured it couldn't hurt to add some more color to my ensemble, so I tucked it behind my ear for the rest of the trek to Jaws. Mario spent a little longer at the aid station, and I ended up doing the rest of the climb almost entirely alone.

As the sun began to set, the weather rapidly cooled. I layered up and strapped on a headlamp for the long night ahead. The trail continued to pass through muddy, slow sections, but the golden hour views more than made up for it. Elks bugled in the distance just out of sight. Just after dark, I started to see the first runners heading back.

The last few miles to Jaws had shin-deep standing water. At 9,000 feet up, with the temperatures now just below freezing, this was an unwelcome development. I reached Jaws at 10:40pm, now back on my target splits despite the tough conditions. Alex was waiting for me in the giant heated aid station tent, and the next ten minutes were a whirlwind of sock changes, adding layers of clothing, grabbing hot food, and of course getting a kiss to keep my spirits up (perks of having your wife crew you!).

I walked out of the aid station still munching on some warm quesadillas. The short break from running had left me chilly and my movements were stiff and slow. I slogged back through the shin-deep water section, soaking my new socks. It was going to be a long descent back to Sally's.

The 18 mile climb to Jaws had taken just under six hours (20 min/mi). In my race planning, I figured that the descent would be much faster, ideally about 4.5 hours (15 min/mi). This seemed conservative since I'm typically a good downhill runner and the grade of the descent didn't look bad on paper. What I hadn't accounted for was the mud (have I mentioned the mud yet?).

When all was said and done, I rolled into Sally's after well over 5 hours of descending, once again well behind schedule. The mud, the cold, and the dark had conspired to activate the what-the-fuck-am-I-doing-with-my-life lobe of my brain, and I was feeling very sorry for myself. But I still had to get back to Alex at the finish line, so there was no time to sulk.

I changed out of my Speedgoats and into my ridiculously plush Glide Max shoes. It was just after 4am, and the sun would be out soon. Despite the mental low, I was certainly going to finish this thing.

##**Sally's to the Finish**

Once again, Sally's delivered a world class aid station experience, and I left while munching on a sausage McMuffin. During my ascent of The Wall, I would periodically pull out this greasy cylinder of hyper-processed factory-farmed organ meat and nibble on it for motivation. Then I would jam it back into my sweaty running vest like Napoleon Dynamite squirreling away his tater tots. This must be what people mean when they talk about a runner's high.

The sun finally came out and we were greeted with another day of mild weather. With the power of a thousand emulsified animals coursing through my digestive tract, I hammered up the wall at a blistering 28 minute per mile pace. I was now back on top of the ridge and had only a few short climbs and one massive descent left.

Somewhere in this section I linked up with Dandelion, another Wyoming runner whose parents, she assured me, were not hippies. She was one of those all-around mountain athlete types, and we spent a few hours talking about her rock climbing, skiing, and mountaineering adventures. Somehow, my two favorite things to talk about during an adventure are past adventures and future adventures.

Shortly after I passed through Dry Fork, the 18 mile race started from that aid station. I have mixed feelings about how the next few hours played out. On one hand, it was a huge pain in the ass to pull over for the faster runners and to get stuck behind the more timid runners who slowed down in the mud while I wanted to just plow straight through. On the other hand, it was nice to have some people to talk to who weren't all sleep deprived zombies.

I slip-slid my way down the final descent feeling more like a drunken skier than a trail runner, making sure to take in the last few alpine views. At some point in here I slipped and attempted to brace my fall with my hands, only for them to sink into the mud up to my elbows. This is fun. We're having fun. I rinsed the smelly goo off in a stream, trying not think about the amount of cow shit I had seen in prior mud patches.

The last five miles were entirely on roads and descended at a mellow grade. I had envisioned trotting through this at a nice leisurely 12 min/mi pace, or perhaps in a final burst of energy, hammering some 8 minute miles. On that particular day and time, all my legs could manage was a pained 14-15 min/mi shuffle. As a matter of pride I maintained a running cadence, but a very friendly 18-mile runner was able to match my pace while power walking.

I crossed the finish line a little after 2pm after more than 29 hours of running. Alex and her baby bump were there to greet me. Boy Alex had finished two hours earlier, also an hour behind his time goal. We decided that our race execution must have been perfect, but the course must have been an hour slower than normal because of the trail conditions (I am not interested in investigating this further).

Final time: 29:18:34 (63rd of 226 starters)

##**Epilogue**

We often turn my destination races into week long vacations, and in this case we drove out to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks after the race. If you are considering running Bighorn, these are ideal places to visit while recovering from an ultra. There are tons of views, geothermal features, and wildlife that are visible from the side of the road. We even managed to do a little alpine scrambling despite my tired legs and Alex carrying a small human in her belly.

Bighorn was equal parts spectacular and awful. The views and the aid stations were among the best I've ever seen, but the mud was unrelenting. I doubt I'll ever race it again, but I'm glad to have done it once. Thank you to all of the event organizers and volunteers and of course to my wife and daughter for supporting me!",running

1841,1700008310.0,Relative Intensity of Intervals vs Continuous Efforts,"I got a Garmin a few months ago and have been following the Suggested Daily Workouts (almost) religiously, which has been great. When the “Tempo” suggestions go from 3x6:00 to 3x8:00 and I can do them at the same or better pace and HR, I know that I’ve gained fitness. I am curious about how to compare the intensities of some of the suggestions, though. Sometimes the workout will be given as (usually) three intervals, with 2-3 minutes of rest between each, and sometimes it will just be one 15-20 minute block.  
How does a 3x8:00 really compare with, say, 20 minutes continuous? It’s greater time overall, but surely the continuity counts for something as well. I don’t have great intuition for which one is “harder,” and they only come up as suggestions about once a week, so it’s hard to compare directly.

### Background 
I've never been a very competitive runner but have always enjoyed the ride to some extent. I've run 5 half marathons before, usually in really pretty places with tough courses. The last half I ran had 1500 feet of vertical climbing, and I wasn't terribly concerned with time. I was just there for snacks and excellent views. I stopped running for about a year and a half before I moved from Switzerland to Boston. For obvious reasons living here got me back into running again. I ran the 10k in July with basically no training and came in at 1:10. I decided then that I'd love to try and do the half and set time goals for the first time. 

### Training
I called an old friend who coaches cross country at a small college and asked them to help me throw together a plan. I paid them in dinner and drinks and we put together a plan that tops out at 30 miles per week. We settled on a time goal of 2:10 based on my 10k time. He told me it was a bit ambitious given the lack of recent running but it was absolutely achievable. 

The training went very well. I absolutely learned to love the grind again. I got to see so much of my neighborhood. I met some good running friends and explored some great running paths around the city. 

There were a couple hiccups here and there. A few minor injuries, a few moments of self doubt but this community absolutely helped me quiet my mind a bit and stick to the training. 

My favorite training run ended up being 2 mile warm up and then 8 miles of alternating goal pace and easy pace (10 miles total with 4 at goal pace). Just an excellent way to spend a Saturday.

### Pre-race
The weather was pretty cold but absolutely beautiful. Bright and sunny with minimal wind, around 35-40 degrees. I love the cold so this felt like a good omen for me. I felt pretty confident but has some lingering doubts without having done 13.1 at pace before, and having never actually *raced* a race before. I felt great though and I set my fastest time since highschool (10+ years ago) in the mile during my taper. 

The organization at the race was great. I think B.A.A does a good job with the logistics so no surprise here. Got lined up in the corral and started dancing to keep warm and get hyped! Started to realize I had to pee again but hoped it was just nerves.

### Race
First 5k absolutely flew. I had to reel myself in a little bit and then realized I was way faster than my goal pace. My partner and dog met me at mile 4 and my dog gave me a good luck lick on the face. 

I debated easing off within 10k but my legs felt like they'd never quit. I saw my 10k come in at 56 minutes which shocked me. I realized I'm at sub 2 hour pace and had to adjust my goals mid race because I was going to crush it. 

I decided to aim for 2:05 and see how my legs would hold up. At mile 8 I realized I definitely had to pee at some point. Found a portopotty at mile 9 which slowed me down a lot but was absolutely ready to throw everything into it for the last stretch! Started losing steam towards the end but pushed to finish at 2:04! 

### Post-race
Felt amazing! My partner pointed out something that really highlighted how well training went: both of the 10ks in this race were 10 minutes faster than my July 10k race! 

My coach friend texted me absolutely thrilled for me and told me we're going sub 2 in 2024!

### Training
I'm a 39 year old male with two kids, a dog and a consulting business I share with my wife. I was a (not great) high school athlete (rowing mostly) and didn't start running for my own ends until I was 25. Spent the next decade running 3-6 times a week, training for various things (a 20 mile trail race was probably the highlight). Previous PR in the half was in the 1:50-ish range. I don't recall the time exactly (RIP DailyMile). 

I properly re-started running after a three year (pandemic-related) hiatus this spring. That coincided with a commitment to stop eating like crap (and cut back on alcohol) at the beginning of 2023. That along with much more focused weight training meant I had lost 20-25 pounds by the start of this training cycle. 

Before the cycle began I set a big PR in a June local 8K (38:45 vs. a 2021 time of 48:48 on no real training) and started to question whether I could get a lot faster with proper training. 

So I asked around town and got a recommendation for a coach (shoutout to Lindsey Funch! She rocks!). Fast forward through a summer base-building phase, a long August vacation and I was ready to start training in earnest. 

Training went pretty smoothly. Through my base build and my first month of the cycle I focused on keeping easy runs in Zone 2 (challenging given that Durham is one big hill). A July 2-mile time trial on the track was a suckfest but ended up being a pretty good predictor of where my fitness would go. 

This was the first time I'd ever done speedwork. It was the first time I trained with intentional strength workouts. First time I thought intentionally about fueling workouts. It was the first time I'd ever had a coach. All great things. 10/10 recommend. 

Managed to stay relatively uninjured and jump on rehabbing any minor issues (some intermittent Posterior Tibialis weakness causing cramping sometimes reared its head). Had a good PT in my corner for advice (also 10/10 recommend a running-focused PT, applied early and often). 

The only memorable hiccup was a really awful 12 mile long run with HMP intervals in Chicago the week after catching a stomach bug from my kid. Thought I was recovered but my HR was off the charts from the warmup onward. Had to bail on the last interval and jog it in. Then had to bail on the jog-in entirely and take an uber. Got a Big Gulp fountain Coke from the 7/11 on the corner while waiting for the uber. That was the best part by far. 

All in all, a really positive, fun training block. I had set a PR in the 10K at 46:21 in October. I was running my HMP and 5K pace intervals faster than planned so I thought I had the fitness to go pretty fast (for me), but I had no idea how fast. The time goal was one big mystery from 1:50 on down to 1:40. 

### Pre-race
Friday morning I was doing one last pre-race shakeout with my dog. In the last 100 yards I felt a little twinge in my calf and very slowly jogged it in. Skipped the planned strides so as not to turn the twinge into a full-blown cramp. Spent the next 24 hours obsessing about whether I would be able to run properly. 

Family came with me and we stayed at an Airbnb in a beautiful neighborhood in Richmond. We met a close friend and her running partner (they were also running the race) for dinner on Friday night. Had fun, no booze, got to bed early. 

Got up at 5:00AM. Had toast with honey and PB, a banana and coffee. Foam rolled. Applied lube. Applied nipple guards. Checked the gear. The usual routine.  

I had pre-booked an Uber to the start line for 6:10. He confirmed and got in touch in the AM. All seemed Go. Until he couldn't get through the roadblocks. 10 minutes later he told me to cancel and I did. Started walking toward the start (2 miles or so). I searched for a Lime scooter on the Uber app and found one two blocks away. Go searching for it. Pace up and down this sketchy alley three times trying to find it. Finally pull it out of a bush between a house and a parked car. Sorry to the person who was clearly saving that Lime for their next day's transportation. Scooter to the start, meet my friend at her hotel. Hang for a bit and head to the start line. 

### Race
We got to the race start. Said goodbye to my friends as they moved back to the 2:00 pace group area. Slotted myself into the gap between the 1:40 and 1:45 pace groups. Ate some salt tabs and a gel. Shed my throwaway sweats (though I do miss that fly windbreaker I got at goodwill). 

Gun went off, and I kept repeating to myself that I needed to stay conservative. Plan was to go out for the first 6 miles at 7:55-8:00/mi. I got pretty close. Saw my family at mile 2, gave some high fives. 

The only negative in the first 10K was that the race was on a heavily-cambered road, and there was nowhere flat to run. It was killing my left knee until the road finally flattened out about mile 5. 

Miles 5-7 were the ""hilliest"" of the course, although I kept waiting for this big hill I had heard about. Turns out living at the top of a big hill prepares you well. My slowest miles were in this section, although I don't believe the 8:30-ish pace my watch spat out. It was measuring long and I think the GPS snafu'd in there. Splits felt more consistent than that. By the time we exit the park I was feeling good. 

The next mile or so through the neighborhood was steady and I started to look forward to the end of the race. There's a turnaround just before mile 8 where you can see the folks in front of you. I saw the 1:40 pace group a decent distance ahead of me (maybe 1/2 mile?) and thought I had enough in the tank to catch them. So I turned it up and started to think about making 1:40 happen. 

Spent the remainder of the race picking folks 50 yards ahead and catching up to them. By mile 12 I was definitely in the pain cave, but hey, that's what we're here for. Sprinted it out down the big hill to the finish, wondering if I'd be able to make 1:40 reality as the pace group sped up and stayed ahead of me. 

Crossed the line with 1:39:xx on the clock with a feeling of elation. I'd beat 1:40. Didn't think it was possible. And I might have even beat 1:39. Turns out I did, but I wouldn't find out until later that morning.  

### Post-race
My family was on the side of the finish chute. Grabbed my medal and a water and then met them. I should have headed to the island and gotten that sweet fleece blanket, but I was worried about getting an uber back after my morning, so we started walking up the hill. Spent the next 40 minutes shivering trying to get home. Finally got to the Airbnb, showered and headed to Sub Rosa for the best pastries I've had on the East Coast. They did not disappoint. 

A little sore in my right knee (IT band maybe?) but otherwise I feel good. Overall, this block has been a great experience. I'm going take a week off (coach insists) and then go to work on dropping my 5K PR over the next few months.

1859,1699919302.0,I ran a marathon without training and did not die (but I did fall in a lake),"**Background:**

I'm a 30-year-old woman who rarely exercised before the pandemic but got really into hiking, trail-running, and climbing when the rest of the world shut down. I was that kid who refused to run the mile in middle school PE. I did not do any organized sports. I dabbled in fitness a tiny bit in college but the extent of my workouts pre-2020 were 15 minutes of running and a few situps.

By 2022, I was either running or climbing daily and hiking most weekends -- doing my best to be better than a weekend warrior, you know how it is. But I wasn't (and still am not) very organized about any of this. I just do what I want on any given ""training"" session.

I spent November 2022 in New Zealand, mostly backpacking and doing a bit of trail running. My childhood best friend got stuck there during the pandemic and is never coming home to the US  now because why would you? It's beautiful there. She's run a number of marathons and was talking them up the whole time I visited, so when I found myself in Queenstown the day of the marathon last year...I signed up.  
My plan was to run the half, which still would've been a stretch. At the time, the longest run I'd ever done was 11 miles (and that was during the trip to NZ). But the half was sold out, my friend had to drive back to her little town, and I had a day to kill before my flight back to the States, so a full marathon it was! I had absolutely no idea what to expect. I spent some time madly googling, was well-informed that what I was about to do was very dumb, and decided to do it anyway.

&#x200B;

**Training:**

As noted, I did not explicitly train at all. I had no plans of running a marathon any time soon, though it was on my mind as an idea for the future. Maybe sometime in the text year.

That said, I was in very good shape when I attempted this, and probably would not have tried if I hadn't been. For most of 2022, I was running 3-5 miles 4x per week and going to the climbing gym the other 3 days. My primary mode of transportation was my bike. Most weekends, I did long hikes, averaging 10-25 miles and a lot of elevation gain. I'd guess I ran 15 miles, cycled 50 miles, and hiked 20 miles in any given week throughout 2022. In short: my cardiovascular fitness and leg strength were both quite high.

And then I spent the three weeks leading up to the marathon in a sort of bootcamp without intending to do so. The friend with whom I was staying is an ultrarunner. We did multiple 10-mile trail runs after work, spent three consecutive weekends doing backpacking trips involving about 15 miles/day off-trail over-land hiking, and on our ""rest days"" went gravel biking or climbing. I spent those three weeks perpetually hungry and sleeping incredibly well due to the exhaustion, but I quickly got whipped into the best shape of my life.

I signed up for the marathon on a Thursday which was already meant to be a rest day -- the first complete rest day of the entire trip. After signing up, I obviously did not do the hike I had originally planned for Friday. That meant I went into the marathon with two full days of rest, which is about as much rest as I have ever given myself in my entire life, and left me feeling totally antsy by Friday night. I drugged myself with Benadryl in order to sleep.

  
**Race Morning:**

I got up with my alarm feeling weirdly good at 5am (for an 8:20am race, where the last bus to the start line was at 6:45am). Since I didn't really have a race day nutrition plan, I ate my normal breakfast of a banana and peanut butter (with a bit more peanut butter than usual) and coffee, and brought an extra banana to eat right before the race. Then I walked to the bus stop and waited nervously with two other marathoners, also from out of town, all of us not at all sure whether the bus would come. It did, and we made it to the start line!

It was lightly raining and there were tons of people. The weather felt perfect and the energy felt good. I had an audiobook downloaded and ciabatta in my pocket; how could I fail?

**The Course:**

Most of the route is on hard-packed dirt/gravel trails. A small section is on boardwalks or bridges (I walked because I was afraid of slipping here). The remainder is on paved roads.

The [course](https://queenstown-marathon.co.nz/assets/Uploads/2022/Maps/QTM-FullMarathonCourseMap.pdf) follows a river until the second aid station at 7 kilometers, then briefly a road until the 3rd aid station, then loops around a small lake for aid stations 4 and 5 until 18 kilometers, then follows a road until it picks up a river again at the 7th aid station at kilometer 26.5. After that, most of the elevation and all of the road running is done, and it's very pleasant along a river and then the lake past 4 more aid stations until kilometer 42. It finishes right in downtown Queenstown and runs right along the popular touristy waterfront, so there were lots of spectators. Running this far really highlights how small of a town Queenstown is, though -- most of the course you feel really far from town!

To summarize:

Aid station 1 after 3km

Aid station 2 after 7km

Aid station 3 after 10.5km

Aid station 4 after 13.5km

Aid station 5 after 18km

Aid station 6 after 22.5km

Aid station 7 after 26.5km

Aid station 8 after 29.5km

Aid station 9 after 32km

Aid station 10 after 35.5km

Aid station 11 after 39km

Finish at 42km

Since I didn't have any experience with a run this long, I used the aid stations to pace myself. Each one meant water and snack. I also used the portapotties more often than I probably needed to because I did not want to be caught without one.  


**The Race:**  
I was probably the chillest person at the start line because I did not care how it went beyond surviving. I also had no idea how fast I was going to go so I started among the slowest group, then ran far too fast for them (and me, let's be real), then slowed way down when I realized I was being dumb and going too quickly. For reference, I ran my (longest ever) 11 mile trail run at about 9:30 pace, so there was no way I was going to do that for more than double the distance. I probably should've started out running 10:30-minute-miles, but I don't have a smartwatch so I wasn't paying that much attention.  
I also did not carry much of anything with me because I never do on runs and didn't want to start during a marathon. My plan, which I pretty much followed, was to slow to a walk when I saw an aid station, drink the water and eat the snacks they gave me, then continue to walk for a couple minutes before resuming running, while otherwise running the whole time. It worked well and I didn't feel nauseated. I did shove some ciabatta into my pockets that morning because I figured I'd need extra carbs and that was a good decision because I don't love goos or chews but I do love bread. Even smashed up bread that has been in a pocket for several hours.

  
Because I did not have a speed goal, I figured I should appreciate the route. For me, this meant touching every body of water, something I always do when traveling. If you read the title, you can see where this is going.  
Somewhere about mile 8, I skittered down an embankment to touch a lovely lake. This was ill-advised, because the embankment was absolutely covered in the slipperiest moss you have ever seen, and I ended up touching that lake with my entire body. Invigorating! 10/10 recommend when you're flagging on a long run -- a surprise cold-plunge really gives the adrenaline rush you may need. Running the rest of the route all wet was less ideal.

The portion up to the lake had passed pretty quickly, but miles 9-15 really dragged, possibly because I was soaking wet. This was also the portion of the race mostly on the road instead on trails, and I don't generally run on roads if I can avoid it. I let myself walk a little bit of each km, right at the km markers. This was great psychologically, because a kilometer feels like nothing! If I get a break every kilometer, I'm basically taking constant breaks! When we were back on the trail again, I resumed running more consistently.

  
I finished in under 5 hours (barely barely barely). I hated the people shouting ""you can do it"", especially the ones very close to the end because like dude I know I've run 25.9 miles I can manage 0.3 more! When I finished, I was so single-mindedly obsessed with acquiring a pizza that I didn't even take any pictures at the finish line.  
Oh, and then I had to walk three miles back to my Airbnb because all the roads were closed and I had not come up with a transportation plan.  
*Don't be like me. But if you are like me, make sure you bring more ciabatta. And possibly a swimsuit.*

&#x200B;

**Lessons Learned:**

* Well, obviously, don't run a marathon without training.
* Beyond that, though, I'd say the biggest thing I did right was not trying anything new. I ate food and drank water and wore shoes as I would on a long hike. It all went pretty well. If you're going to jump into something kind of absurd like I did, try to make it as much like something you've done before.
* I was hurting when it was over, but I didn't feel terrible. Walking back to my Airbnb was totally doable. Getting on a 15-hour flight the next day wasn't the most fun, but it was okay.
* Eating is super important also, which I knew well from mega hikes. Fuel your body. Eat that entire pizza. Drink a lot of water. (The temperature was low so I didn't sweat much, but still).
* Since I didn't do much to prepare, I focused a lot on recovery, which for me has always been about sleeping a lot and eating a lot. I know there's a lot of opinions out there on how best to recover, but doing some gentle yoga-like moves to get my muscles to engage and then getting out of my body's way is my go-to.
* I did an easy hike the next day to keep my body moving, but nothing crazy. I didn't run again for 2 weeks, but I did cycle and climb within that window.

Will I ever run another marathon? Who's to say. Knowing me, probably.

I had a pretty bad knee injury this year so I'm just getting back to running right now, which means it won't be any time soon. But I would love to do an ultra. Maybe next summer?

I promise I'll train for that.",running

**Training**

I have never been athletic and actually hated sports/physical activity in my youth. This past year I took up running. It has become my sport and something I care about deeply. I used NRC training, specifically the half marathon training schedule with guided runs. I had completed my first race ever in the spring, a 10 miler, so never stopped running after that.  During training, I never did a walk/run dance. I was very consistent at running the whole time, and this proved to be true during my 10 miler where I didn't have to walk at all. I was pretty consistent getting at least 3 runs in a week but will be honest I fell off around the month out to race day mark. I lost motivation and was maybe averaging 15 miles max around this time. I knew this was going to hurt me race day. Maybe it was a form of self sabotage? Who is to say. But the longest distance I ran pre-race was 10 miles. I was trying to convince myself the race energy would push me through. 

**Pre-race**
I had a Publix sub the night before and watched Beyonce's Homecoming documentary to get pumped up. I actually slept pretty well, woke up and had a yogurt + some coffee. I take a medication in the morning that alters my heart rate, I was debating on not taking in the am but ended up taking. This might of messed up some things looking back. Ubered to the start line and it was COLD. Colder than I anticipated. I probably should of done some warm-ups because I couldn't really feel my legs. I got to my heat and the emotions just started flooding in, was truly sobbing as I crossed the starting line. 

**Race**
Mile 1 was so emotional, I was crying for almost the full mile which messed up my breathing a lot. It was good tears, just proud of myself and in awe by the amount of support from strangers and the community. I made a friend who reassured me that the emotions are normal!

Miles 2-6: I felt good, my stomach was kind of churning and I was very burp-y. I also had a runny nose from all the crying so I was having trouble breathing there. I ran into mile 3 with no headphones but decided to throw them on after mile 3. We crossed over a huge bridge and into the neighborhoods heading towards Bryant park where the middle and meaty part of the race was. I was feeling good on my pace though and really tried not to come out too fast. I tried slowing down a bit in the park to make-up later. We were pushing through the park and finally coming out the other side. People were at the end of the park which was helpful and motivated me to get  outta there. I finished the 10k at 1:04, which is exactly where I wanted to be.

Mile 7-10: After the mile 7 marker I needed a tissue bad. I asked some of the water stations if they had any but no one did so I had to stop at a porta-potty to get some toilet paper. I honestly think this screwed me. I blew my nose and got back into it but my body was feeling very tired. Mile 7-8 were in neighborhoods which was fun but it felt very crowded. I was not returning to my pace and I didn't think I was going to at all. I started the walking/running game from mile 8 well into mile 10. My splits were absolutely crumbling and seemed impossible to get back. I threw the any goal of a time out the window and just pushed to finish. I put on a guided run through the nike run club app to try to distract myself, as these were super helpful in training. I knew my friends were at mile 11 so I pushed through to see them.

Mile 11-13: I was pretty over it but seeing my friends was a whole new wave of emotions. There were so many people lining the streets screaming and cheering but seeing my pals was just the best. I walked a little into mile 11 but promised myself we needed to run through mile 12. My airpods died at mile 10 so I put them back in the case and just let the crowd act as my music. I made the turn and hit the downhill for the last .6, not really feeling much of anything. I finally saw the finish and blasted through feeling relieved but also pretty humbled.

**Post-race**
I walked through and got my hat, infamous blanket, and medal. I had no idea what my time was but honestly didn't really care. I realized my airpods fell out of my belt at around mile 12 sadly. It was SO crowded at the finish and took me about 20 minutes to find my friends as there was no service for a while. After getting my time back I was relieved to see my 2nd goal was at least achieved but I know I can do better. My feet are full of blisters and I am definitely sore but determined and ready for another race.

### Training
This was my 3rd year training and running for half marathons, and I planned to do two this year; #3 was the DPR Trail Races Half Marathon 4 weeks ago, and #4 was the Madison Half Marathon yesterday.  This led to setting up about a 20 week training block where I would run the first race after 16 weeks, rest a week, then redo the last 3 weeks of training leading into the final race.

My training really got messed up at about the 8 week mark by an international trip where I brought COVID home with me.  Symptoms were mild, but I had a full week off and a very gradual return where I just felt like my lungs were not clear of mucus and my HR would jump to 70-75% within 30 seconds of starting to run where it would normally take 10+ minutes if I was at an easy pace.  Around the time of the DPR Trail race, one of my kids was also getting sick with something, and I'm pretty sure I picked it up too - within the first mile of the race, at a pace of 10-10:30/mi or so, my heart rate was already in the low 90%s.  That race was a huge struggle that just felt difficult, coupled with rain, part of the course being under 2 feet of water leading to heavy/wet feet, and GI issues.  I logged a 2:15 there, missing a PB by a little over a minute.

In the weeks after that race, I finally felt like I turned a corner and cleared the crap out of my lungs, and my long run paces started to improve to where I could keep my HR <75% max at a pace of 11-11:30 or so.  What I did start to experience unfortunately were weird niggles; my upper back, a dorsiflexor tendon on my left foot, my right hip, etc.  I figured it was just the accumulated fatigue of the race and the longer-than-usual training cycle.

My taper got a bit screwed up by being busy and not feeling 100% physically, so the last week I really only ran the 12mi long run on Sunday, 30 minutes of tempo on Wednesday, and then rested hard for the race on early Sunday morning.

### Pre-race
Got dropped off near the square and started eating my pre-race food.  I have T1 diabetes and have developed some strategies for eating some foods that digest both quickly and slowly to have even blood sugars throughout the race with the use of my insulin pump.  As I went around the square to the back of the corral entry, I couldn't find the bank of port-o-potties.  Being short on time, I didn't have a chance to go, but I had gone just before leaving the hotel so it was alright.  I found the 2:15 HM pacer and was planning to stick with them for a while since there was a 2:00 HM pacer that would be out of my reach.

I then noticed a 4:20 full marathon pacer and realized that I could follow them for a 2:10, but also that at some point when the courses diverged I would lose them.  Temperature was about 40 degrees, felt perfect for me.  The sun was rising and the temp would reach around 50 by the end of the race.

### Race
Mile 1 is downhill out of the square, and I used the pacer to keep my speed low.  For a 2:15 they should have been running about a 10:15 pace, but they were jumping around between 9:30 and 10:30 so I kinda just went with it.  My HR was staying around 85%, starting high due to the pre-race jitters but not going up, so I figured I was already feeling better than the previous race.  Through the first few miles I stayed with the pacer and held a sub-10 pace, feeling good.

Miles 5-9 I was very encouraged to see my HR holding steady, and that I didn't get too exhausted going up and down the few hills in the race.  I kept the 4:20 marathon pacer mostly in sight and decided I would try to kick at Mile 10 and pass her to guarantee a sub 10min/mi average pace.  Took a Gu around 8 miles or so to keep blood sugar stable as it started to drop.

Mile 10 there was a blast of super frigid air as we came back closer to Lake Monona, and the biggest hill of the race.  I again felt encouraged that it didn't seem too hard to climb, but I felt my quads straining at the eccentric load of going down.  I also had developed a bigtime hotspot behind the ball of my foot on my left foot and knew I would have a blister.  My calves felt good which was also encouraging since I had some bigtime tightness and fatigue in my last long run.

I had a bit of a mental issue at Mile 11 - all of the race course mile markers were bang on, with my Garmin beeping to signify the mile within just a couple of meters of passing the sign.  Then for some reason, as I passed the marker for Mile 11, I didn't feel my watch buzz, so I looked down, and saw it was at 10.80mi.  I kinda gnashed my teeth on that wondering what happened and if I should run extra at the end of the race to make sure my GPS logged 13.1, did I lose signal some how, etc...but then at the 12mi race marker, it was exactly bang on again.  LOL.  No idea who set that Mile 11 marker and why it was like that.  I also heard from my sister after the race that the 10k markers were all jacked up and the total race distance was like 6.37 miles.

At mile 12.5 or so, there was a little out-and-back off of the main road back to the square, presumably to get the distance just correct...but it was down like a 10% grade hill!!  It was brutal to thunderfoot down that, make a hairpin turn, then a steep climb back to the road, ouch.

The last segment was packed with people, when I turned a corner I saw the finish line and accelerated to cross it, knowing I had made my sub 10min/mi goal.

### Post-race
Exceeded my expectations, 8 minutes faster than the sickness and rain-fraught race of 4 weeks prior, and beating my personal best by about 7.5 minutes, coming in just under 2:07.  Got some pizza, mac and cheese, and a light beer.  Knew I would have a blister on my left foot but was otherwise feeling okay - I actually felt like I could have kicked into the 95%HR territory earlier, but with the hills leading into the final push it was just so difficult to muster more speed.

I got the race experience I wanted, and also raised more than $1k for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, whose jersey I was honored to wear for the race.

Another 7 minutes would put me below 2 hours for the half, which is going to be my goal for the end of 2024!",running
1862,1699896210.0,Richmond Marathon: Not Your Usual Goals Race Report,"Race Name: Richmond Marathon   
Date: Nov 11th, 2023   
Distance: 26.2 miles   
Location: Richmond, VA   
Time: 4:37:04 

Goal Description Completed? Boom goes the dynamite   
A High five all the kids: Yes (32 total)  
B Drink a beer in the party neighborhood: Yes (two small beers)  
C Do a shot of Fireball: Yes (oof)  
D High five all the folks at Grace & Lombardy: Yes (so many people)  
  
Richmond was my third marathon this year and I had given myself permission to just run for fun and not worry about a time. It was SO liberating to not have any expectations.   
  
Well, I did have expectations but not the usual ones. My goals were to high five everyone that I could, hit all the ""power up"" signs, drink a beer on Fauquier in the party neighborhood, do a shot of Fireball with a friend who helps with SAGs all year, and high five as many people as I could at the corner of Grace and Lombardy.  
  
The weather was perfect, and I felt pumped. I chatted w a few people who had their ""1st marathon"" stickers on their bibs and wished them an awesome first race. I managed to see a few friends once we all got started which was fun. During mile 1, I ran over and gave two friends a hug and knew I'd see them later for a second round of hugs.   
  
Since it was a bit chilly, I had a throw away jacket that I pulled from my donate pile. I decided that it was kind of cute and so I'd keep it. Our training team had a drop area for things we wanted to keep and pick up next weekend at our reunion run. I was going to drop my jacket there but remembered the course literally runs by my backyard, so I’d just hop off course super-fast and throw my jacket over the fence. The police officer at the intersection was laughing at me when I told her what I was doing. I went around her car the same way, so I didn’t cut the course. On Strava it’s funny to see this tiny blip where I tossed the jacket.   
  
Running down by the river was pretty as always (miles 8 - 10ish). There were some people out dressed as aliens offering to abduct anyone who didn’t want to finish the race which was funny. Go through the rolling hills on Forest Ave and then over the bridge. A lot of people struggle w the bridge because it’s about a mile long, but I think about another mile being checked off and boom - I’m on the other side (about 16.5).   
  
On Arthur Ashe Blvd (about mile 20) I stopped to dance quickly and do a small mimosa shot which was delicious. Once I got close to the Pope Arch I walked a bit because I was feeling kind of done. But I knew beer was waiting for me so I started running again.   
  
When I got to Fauquier a guy asked if I wanted a beer (like an inch of Lite beer) and I said I did because it was one of my goals. His wife looked at me like I was crazy. I explained that I was just having fun and stopping at the party was one of my goals. I had finished the beer and he asked if I would like some more – of course I said yes. 

The beer definitely picked me up and I was just running along enjoying Brook Rd (miles 22 - 23.5 are notorious for being a pretty dead zone) before starting the last few turns. I turned on Lombardy and passed through an amazing cheerleader squad that got me energized again. Close to Broad I saw my friends, got my second round of hugs, and did a shot of Fireball. Honestly, I immediately regretted that since it felt heavy in my belly but figured if I puked, I puked. It wouldn’t be the first time in a race. Maybe mentally that attitude helped because I felt fine quickly.  
  
Got up to the November Project/We Off the Couch/lululemon corner (mile 24) and must have high-fived at least 50 people. Felt super stoked and made my way to the finish line. I saw a couple of my coaches and they said I looked really strong which was awesome. Made the final turn to head down the hill and was done. I finally looked at my watch – 4:37:04. 

It was no where near my PR, but marathon #9 was by far the most fun.

**Training**

Used 10 Week Runner's World Challenge ""The Break 2:15 Half Marathon Plan"". Last and second half was in 2018 and I ran a 2:27. Prior to that it was a run walk time of 2:37. I had a goal of dropping another ten minutes this time so found a 2:15 plan that seemed feasible.I experienced my first ever case of shin splints in July so I took the entire month of August off and focused on mobility, rest, massage and physio. Started hot the first week of September and caught covid right at the start of week 2. It was luckily mild and only took me out for all of week 2. Started back up in week 3 with a focus on not pushing myself too much. Felt back to normal by week 4.  It began as a 4 day a week program and moved into 5 days by week 7. Due to the setback early on I opted to keep it to 3x until moving to 4x in week 5 and then upped to 5x in week 7. I converted the plan from miles to KMs so I did some rounding off to keep things simple.I kept to the recommended paces as best as I could. Tended to to be a little slower in the first half of the program and quicker during the second half. Training went very well overall and I managed to beat my 2:27 half PR on my last long run of the program with a time of 2:25. That set a great tone for race day.

**Pre-race**

We flew to Disney on Thursday(Stayed at the Swan Hotel on property) and did exactly what you’re not supposed to do for three days. Walked 20,000 steps at Disney each day before the race. Was already tired and sore going into race eve. We grabbed runner’s boxes in the hotel store which had banana, cliff bar, PB, honey, bagel, Powerade and water bottle. I brought my own tortillas and rolled it up with PB before going to bed. Went to bed at 8:30, woken up by fireworks at 9 and then again by firework testing at midnight. Luckily we were blessed by daylight savings time and were gifted another hour of sleep.

**Race**

Alarm set for 2:45 and on the bus to the race by 3:20am. Walked almost 5000 steps to get to starting corral and was lucky to be in corral B (by submitted POT of 1:00:03 for a 10k). Started 8 mins past 5am and had 3/4 of the race in the dark with no hot sun beating down.The earlier corrals had very little crowding and no issues of moving around walkers or big groups of runners. I chose to start at the very back of my corral so I had no pushing or rushing pre race. The whole race felt great and I reminded myself that I didn’t want to start breathing heavy until at least 16km in. The race begins in the Epcot parking lot and after a few KM goes through Epcot park. We then headed into and through Hollywood studios to the highway where we settled in for the majority of the race. The park portions were a nice distraction and many park staff were out cheering us on. Many people stopped to take pictures with characters but that’s not something that interests. I enjoyed running by and seeing who the characters were. I started out with an intention to focus on a 6:25/km pace. After 10k I gave myself permission to move closer to 6min kms. After 15k I knew I had plenty left in the tank and started to push myself. The sun came up around 15k. A couple more kms on the highway and then the last bit was back in Epcot. I was no longer looking around and enjoying the sights and just focusing on maintaining breath and pace. Knowing I was .5km ahead of the actual race distance was a bit of a struggle when I came into the last 2 kms. I couldn’t look at my watch because I annoyed that I was going to finish 21.1k well before I reached the finish line and I also don’t have a great grasp on how far a mile is so those signs didn’t help either. I pushed through and was thrilled to see my watch hit 2:07:51 when I passed 21.1km and knew that I just had to push a little further to seal in an official PB at the finish line. My legs turned to bricks as soon as I stopped running and I was happy to zombie walk through the medal station, grab two Powerades and a running box and then grab my bag at bag check. I made it past the marked lines on the ground and sat down to snack and wait for my mother who ran a corral back. The sun was fully up by then and kept me warm while I waited. The snack box had a banana, honey stinger waffle, chips, cheese dip and skittles. When the party was back together we made our way to the bus pickup spot and hopped on a bus immediately. Run Disney transportation was very efficient and I would highly recommend.

*Lessons Learned:* Take it easier the days before the race(like I did during training). Schedule in a pool/rest day over an active day. Otherwise I wouldn’t change a thing.

*Next Goal*: A sub 2:00 half next fall. If anyone has any fall half marathons they recommend, I’d love to hear about them!",running
1864,1699835750.0,"Judge my first Marathon - Richmond, VA","Hiii r/running, first time poster long time lurker. So I (37M) ran my first Marathon in Richmond on Saturday and I’d love to get you guys feedback/criticism whatever. 

Official time was just under 3 hrs 37 mins and stayed around 8 min/mi except for outliers of 7:22 and 8:50. 

Training consisted of 20-35 mile weeks for the past 2 years, (4) 40 + mile weeks and (1) 50 mile week leading up to the race. Tapered hard as I developed shin splint issues after running 10 miles the day after my lone 20 mile run (I’m not a smart man) about 3.5 weeks prior. Ran a trail half 2 weeks before (ran well) then only did four short runs in the 2 weeks leading up to Richmond. None of my training runs were focused on pace or tempo really, I pretty much wing em all and pace can be anywhere from 7:30 for a 5k up to 10:30 for long runs. Did speed work 5 days prior and a 4 mile run at goal pace (8:00) 4 days out. 

Things I did right (I think):

Day of fuel!  - PBJ and banana for breakfast then a stroopwafel 10 mins before the start. Planned for a gel every 45 but ended up having 6 plus 2 servings of Cliff Bloks. Hydration mix almost every 2 miles at the aid stations. Salt pill every hr. 

This one could be controversial but weed gummies 🍃 - it keeps the boredom alway and the vibes going, especially good with my earbuds in 🎶. I listen to music in most races 5k+ except for the start and finish. I can’t recommend gummies enough so curious if anyone else does this. 

Lube - lube everything people! I saw a couple guys with bloodily nipples and you really don’t want to be that guy plus how uncomfortable. 

Clothes: comfortable singlet, tab socks, also I  recently started using tights and I really can’t recommend them enough. Vaporfly’s because I’m a zoom x whore. 

Things I did wrong: 

Day before meals - the MORNING of the race I’m reading a Reddit thread on marathon tips (again, not smart) and someone said “don’t try to be a pasta eating champion the night before” anyway I definitely PR’d at around 8:30pm with a massive bowl of clam pasta with red sauce plus broccoli and fennel and one glass of red. Honestly I think I’m just lucky here and it may have helped in the end.  I would recommend to drink coffee early the day of to get it all out though.  

Needs improvement:

Hydration - pretty much consumed the hell out of water for 2-3 days prior but I did get pretty drunk with friends 3 and 2 nights prior and I didn’t really drink much water the morning of.  Also I did not practice fueling strategy and would run 10-18 with 2-3 gels and water.  I’ve taken up to 4 in a half marathon before. 

Focused training and more mileage obviously 🫤

Honorable Mentions: 

Sunscreen! - even on a cloudy day you will get a ton of Sun in 3-5 hrs. 

Picking a strongly supported marathon - 
I really can’t say enough about Richmond. Relatively flat course but the whole thing is pretty much a party. So many out cheering and I honestly think that makes a difference. 

Training in a hilly city - I live in Charlotte, NC which is moderately hilly and also spend a lot of time running (slowly) in the mountains. 

Anyway, congratulate me, judge me. Either way I love this community. It truly helped me prepare for this marathon and I wish all of you a goodnight. 

P.S.  I’m writing this from an epsom salt bath and while I can walk around well enough the legs are pretty sore.",running
1865,1699873762.0,Anyone here has BQ'd through the adaptive program for para athletes? How did they deal with cut-off times?,"**ETA 10 days later, to help future people who might be looking this up:**

I got my answer from the BAA, as of November 2023 (so running a qualifying marathon in 2024 and running Boston in 2025), there are no cut-off times for disabled athletes running through the adaptive program. 

From the BAA answer I got ""The field is not full for these programs, so we \[the Adaptive Programs and Para Divisions\].do not have a cut off.""

**OG post:**

Hello all, I posted this question on the daily Q&A thread yesterday, but didn't receive any answers. I hope this is still appropriate as a main post.

I'm quite curious about the cut-off time policy for para athletes. Is it 1-5 minutes like for the pleb (/j), or is it scaled to the adapted qualifying times? I can't find anything about it on Google or the BAA's website.I'm going for a sub-4:30, which is 30 minutes faster than the qualifying time for my disability, but I'm trying to plan for the worst case scenario that would still have me qualify.

By the way - if you did BQ or run Boston as a para athlete, I'd love to hear about your experience in general! I can't find much about it online except for inspiration porn and the main article from the BAA. Very few first hand experiences.",running

# Background

The Kasterlee marathon is a small race in my hometown in Belgium. It consists of a half marathon distance course which runners of the full marathon distance loop around twice. It's around 90% unhardened terrain, which runs through the fields and into the woods. It's a beautiful course, but it's well known for not being a course to set a PR on. This is due to the small trail roads on which it can be very hard to pass other runners, allowing 2 people running next to eachother at max at a lot of times. And also due to the difficult terrain, being a muddy and hilly trail course littered with tree roots and mud puddles.  
This year, there were around 250 marathon runners and something of a 1700 half marathon runners.

Last year, I ran the half marathon here as my first (and only) half marathon distance race. This, for me, was a big accomplishment, as I reached my goal of running it sub 2 hours (1h52). So when the dust had settled, I half jokingly mentioned to my friends I'd run the full marathon distance next year.

And after a couple of months break time from running, the half jokingly turned into a more serious thought. A couple of years ago, running a marathon distance was something I would have never even considered. I thought people were mad for doing something like that. But I already got this far running a half marathon, I'm in my late 20's and feeling fitter than ever. If ever there was a time to go for it, this was it. So I made the decision in my mind to go for it.

&#x200B;

# Training

For my half marathon, I followed a program from the garmin connect app, which I followed pretty dilligently. For the full distance, this wasn't available. So I set out to get some information online and eventually write my own training program.

And then, well, life got in the way.

Around the start of my training block, which I calculated to start months in advance of the race to grant me a lot of time, I made a promotion at my job. Which led to more responsibilities, stress and less free time. I also fell in love with my now girlfriend, which also ate up a lot of time. This, combined with living on my own, doing my own household, groceries, preparing dinner, and still keeping up with my other hobbies such as indoor rock climbing. This made me miss out on a lot of runs I should have done during training. A lot of base building I desperately needed.

It wasn't looking great, but I wasn't about to back down.  
In the last month leading up to the race, I did double down on training. Skipping rock climbing, not going out for drinks with friends, and making sure I did put in the work. I let go of my original goal of finishing it sub 4 hours. Now, my sole goal was to make it to the finish line.

My longest distance I ran in training was 32km. It was hard, I was very out of breath, and my legs were tired. But, I didn't cramp once, and I felt like I could slog out 10 more km's on race day with proper adrenaline and motivation. It would be very hard, but this run gave me just enough confidence to go through with the race. So I started my taper after that.

And then I hit a major issue during/after my first run in my taper. I read that the first week, I should lower the mileage but keep the intensity. So I ran a tempo run on race pace (for a sub 4hr finish). I felt a sharp pain in my lower calf/achilles.  
I managed to go my entire training without any injury, I made sure I always stretched and did exercises to avoid all that stuff, and then in my taper of all things, I got hit with one anyway.  
This was a major blow to my confidence. I let it rest and I barely ran anything during my taper (which I calculated to be 3 weeks). I went to a fysiotherapist the week before my race and she massaged the life out of my calf. It felt good, and I didn't feel any pain on the few runs I did in those last weeks.  


My friends were very supportive, telling me I'd hit that sub 4 hour no problem. They were amazing. But I knew better. I knew my training wasn't enough. I knew my weekly mileage was low. I knew I was in trouble. But I put on a brave face and went through with it.

&#x200B;

# Pre-race

The race was in my hometown, so the day before, I slept over at my parents, as the course litterally passes their backyard. I felt some cold symptoms creeping up, had a runny nose and some bowel issues, which gave me some extra stress, but it was too late to back down.

I packed my gels and jellies which I tested during training. They were the few that didn't give me stomach issues so I was fairly confident in them. Having to go poop during the race was a major fear of mine, as there were very few opportunities to do so on the course, other than going to take a dump in the forest next to the track.

I ate a bowl of oatmeal with some blueberries and a banana. Something that worked for my half marathon last year. I could barely get it down as I wasn't hungry and feeling a bit nauseous. Something I attributed to the stress.

I made my way to the start. I was anxious. The weather was cold, but at least it wasn't raining, and there was some sunshine predicted later in the day. It had been raining a lot past weeks so I was gratefull for that. I knew the track was going to be very muddy because of this, but at least i would be dry during the race.

People started crowding in the starting zone. All runners start at the same time, both half and full distance. I placed myself somewhere around the back. There is some music and a guy with a microphone hyping up the crowd, but I barely notice it. Some guy with a dog stands next to me so to distract myself a little, I tried to chat with him. Turns out he's going to run the race with his dog. The full marathon distance.  
Then the start gets signaled and we scamper off. This is it.

# Race

I immediately got a bad feeling when I took off running. I told myself beforehand to start very slow and build up speed when I got into it. But this feeling wasn't going away. It felt very different from my training runs and my half marathon last year. I knew from the beginning this was going to be a war for me.

Because the race was in my hometown, I was extremely familiar with the course. I ran it a thousand times and used to play in the forest as a kid. Or so I thought, because after around 1.5km, I caught a tree root and toke a nose dive. I managed to catch myself luckily, so it wasn't a full faceplant, but it was enough to rip my race number. It was cold so I had gloves on, which made putting it back on an ordeal in itself. After I managed to do so, I continued.. So far for a smooth start. After a km or 2, there's a narrow point at which the race usually comes to a walk because people are funneled into the small swirling trail. At this point, I think was litterally dead last of the pack.

As we get moving, I start to pass a bunch of people. I wasn't running fast, and nowhere near my original sub 4 race pace, but it was still good for my morale. As we move through the first half of the course, I'm able to keep a decent pace for my liking. The first half, I knew, was the easy half. Flat enough, open enough, easy enough. It's the last 12km of the course where most of the mud battles and hills come into play.

I told myself I would take it easy at the supply posts. So I walked through them drinking a cup and then easily start again. There were supply posts every 5-ish kilometers.  
I also had my parents, bless their supportive souls, biking around so they'd meet me at several points to cheer me on, and to hand me a new water bottle filled with sports drink whenever I needed it. I could not have made it without them.

I trailed through the second half of the course feeling pretty decent. Leading up to the finish line for the half marathon, where most people on the race finish and the full distance racers make another loop. So far, I felt okay. Not great, but decent enough not to give up.

As soon as I leave the pack of people cheering for their half marathon runners, I enter a new kind of loneliness. The second loop, there were very few people left running, and equally few people left next to the track cheering. This was going to be a very solitary struggle. I knew I was among the back of people still running. I had my music, but I got tired of it so I just enjoyed the surroundings as much as I could.

I had been feeling a small nagging pain in my right hip since kilometer 18 or so. Nothing I wasn't able to slog through.  
At kilometer 24, I knew I was running into trouble. I felt very fatigued, my legs started to hurt and feel heavy. People twice my age, size and weight started passing me. A guy with what appeared to be some kind of muscle disease or disorder passed me. I have an insane amount of respect for those people, but everytime such a person passed me, it hit me like a hammer. This was a very humbling experience I will never forget.

Around kilometer 27, the cramps started. Something I had never experienced in my training. This was new for me, even though I had ran 32k before. I felt a slight panic, as I still had a lot of ground to cover, and the hardest part of the course still to come. I took several walk breaks, just to  try to push the cramp out of my quads with my hands. The few people still on and around the course were extremely supportive. I cheered on the couple of walkers I passed as they cheered me on as well. We were sharing the pain it felt.

The last 10-ish kilometers were litteral hell for me. The rugged terrain, the mud, the hills, all were hard enough in the first loop. In the second loop, with my quads cramping like never before, it was pure torture. I knew my friends were waiting for me at the finish line. This was the reason I didn't quit. This is what got me through this last part. They were my light at the end of the tunnel, and without them, I would've dropped out of the race for sure. I continue to alternate walking and running as much as my cramped up body would allow.

As I approach the finish line, I see my friends waiting for me. As they notice me, I start to tear up. I'm tearing up even as I'm writing this now. There is still a bunch of people hanging around the finish line. I'm the only runner around at that time crossing the line and my face and body language are of pure agony. Everyone starting yelling and cheering for me. This is it, I'm going to make it. I've finaly done it.

As I cross the finish line, I get a medal around my neck, and the lady says something to me, but the words don't come through to me. My friends and family run over to me to congratulate me as I'm hit with a truck full of emotions. I'm usually not an emotional person in public, but I cried right then and there. Tears of joy and tears of pain as I hug my friends.

&#x200B;

# Post race

I took a long warm bath. My legs were extremely sore. I felt nauseous from either all the gels, the plain exhaustion, or both. I could barely eat but my body desperately needed some solid food and some nutrients. I ate some pumpkin soup and a bit of spaghetti. I took a painkiller, which made me feel better. I didn't sleep very well because of all the aches and pains. As I'm writing this the day after, I still have a slight headache and very heavy legs.

This was the hardest thing I have ever done both physically and mentally. I've trained boxing and martial arts for a couple of years, but no opponent has ever hit me as hard as this marathon hit me.  
If I could do it all over, I would have sticked to my training plan and increased my weekly mileage by a lot. I would not recommend anyone doing it the way I did.

I always had a lot of respect for the fast runners, running marathon in 2 hours and then some. But this race has given me a lot more respect for the slow runners. Being up and moving on your feet for 5-6 hours or more? That's an insane effort of an entirely different category. This race humbled me like nothing has ever done before. It was a lot of suffering, a lot of pain both physically and mentally.

But was it worth it? 

Yes. Absolutely.

## Training

TLDR: Hal Hidden Novice 2 (entered around week 4). Started training in early July with no real plan. Nightly stretching.

I’ve never been much of an athlete and I was never in to fitness growing up; more the computer-nerd type. And that stuck through most of my twenties. Early in my thirties I did try to reverse course; I busted my ass in the gym — lost a ton of weight — and picked up the running bug.

Over the years I’d run off and on. Some weeks I’d run quite a bit, only to have it taper into nothing for months on ends. But with each new bout of running, there would be new thoughts and dreams of completing a marathon. Plenty of late nights lurking on reddit. Wondering. And ultimately doubting myself. I never committed.

In early July, I decided enough was enough. I either wanted this or I didn’t. Turns out - I did. I started running much more regularly. For the next few weeks, I’d run every other day — roughly 3 to 7 miles — depending on the day. My initial goal was the LA Marathon next March. But I had no real plan. Then I decided to try to run 10 miles (a goal I’ve had since I originally started running over a decade ago). Then I did it again. And on my third attempt — I just kept going. I felt like Forest Gump. I stopped when I hit 13.1.

That night, I signed up for the local marathon (and the LA Marathon). I was going all in. I started researching various marathon training plans and ultimately landed on Hal Higdon’s Novice 2. I counted backwards from November 12th, and entered the program starting in Week 5.

Training went well and I only missed 2 “short” runs during the 14 remaining weeks of the program. I completed every one of my long runs as planned (except I ran my 20 miler a day early). And I never walked once. I live in very hilly terrain so all of my training runs (stave for one 10 mile run I did while in the flatness of Illinois) had quite a bit of elevation gain (my 20 miler topped out at \~210ft gain). And I would stretch every night.

But training wasn’t always rosy. After my last 12 mile run my left knee started bothering me. Great, I thought. I finally made it this far only to be taken down by my taper. I started icing my knee every night and for the next two weeks I tried to ease off my pace a bit. But I stuck to the plan. As race day approached, my knee started feeling better and I felt my confidence grow. I was ready.

## Pre-race

Not much to say other than I hardly slept (excited/anxious). I hadn’t had breakfast before any of my training runs (maybe a banana, here and there) and I didn’t want to change up my routine; so no breakfast. But no problem, I’d grab a banana before heading out. I forgot my banana. I also drank a bit more fluids pre-race than I had before many of my training runs (more on that later). And it was cold (at least for me). 47F at race start.

## Race

Out of the gate I felt good. Cold, but good. My hands were pretty much icicles for the first 30 minutes. But my legs were feeling fresh and my pace was right where I wanted it to be. Slow and steady. The next six or seven miles went by without much thought. I found my rhythm and was having a good time.

By around mile 8, I realized that the course was actually much more hilly than I had anticipated. No problem, I thought — this is why I’ve been training with elevation. But man, I really had to use the bathroom. Must of been all of those fluids. So I used a portable at mile 10 and was back in action. And so it went, miles 11, 12 and 13 were great. At this point, I honestly thought I could achieve my 4.5 hour reach goal. I was feeling great.

Then mile 15 hit and I’m not sure what happened. I feel like something shifted. I was feeling fine but the gravity of 26 miles hit me. At 16 I told myself only 10 more - I got this. At 17, I walked for the first time. Only about 30 seconds. But I felt defeated. One goal was definitely a “No.”

I continued running until I was almost at the 20 mile marker, but I couldn't quite make it. I started walking. Again. This began the next 6.2 miles of off and on walking. It was also extremely hot. 80 degrees. Direct sunlight. Hot. For the remainder of the race, I’d end up running for two minutes, walking for one — rinse and repeat. It wasn’t pretty. And each bout of walking came with the fear that I wouldn’t be able to restart running. But I did. And I made it across the finish line — collapsing before I could even be handed my medal. Like I said, not pretty and certainly not gracious, but I made it.

I did it.

## Post-race

My wife helped me up and I hunted for shade. I couldn’t really walk and my legs ached. My whole body ached. Definitely the most pain I’ve ever voluntarily inflicted upon myself. But I also felt — different. I did it. I kept going when I thought I had nothing left and I accomplished my goal. And my wife and daughter were there to see it. The feeling was indescribable.

# Final Thoughts

I’m not going to lie — I’m a bit bummed that I walked. But I have a plan. I'm jumping right into my next training program (probably in a week or two). I need a bigger base. I need more weekly mileage. And I’ll be ready for LA.",running
1870,1699807672.0,Up & Down Hills: Who's Doing It Wrong?,"Quick background: 52yo recreational runner.  Heavier than most runners (5'9"" and fluctuate between 215-222 lbs), which may be relevant here.  Ran half-marathon this morning...2:02 beating 2:05 goal. Use a sports watch and have watched and used heartrate MUCH  more in training for this race than ever before.

Today's race was NOT very hilly overall (\~250 ft difference between high and low points), but had rolling hills throughout.  Approximate course is detailed here... [https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1614097987](https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1614097987).  For my ""hill"" strategy, I decided to commit almost 100% to an ""even perceived effort"" approach, which is what I understand most experts recommend.  I was also monitoring my HR to back my estimation of perceived effort.  While my HR did pick up maybe 10 bpm on hills today, I kept it close to even.  

The result?...I was SPEEDING by almost everybody near me going downhill, but was also getting regularly passed going up hills.  On this not very hilly course, my fastest mile was 8:15 and slowest was  10:26 (with a 9:19 average).

So the question...who's doing it wrong?  Are the vast majority of runners (at least those near my pace) taking the wrong approach to hills?  Am I missing something and perhaps have a better strategy available to me?  Or maybe are we all ""doing it right"" and my extra weight simply dictates that I  should use a different hill approach than other comparable, but lighter, runners?

1878,1699805722.0,The Richmond Half Marathon: A (Mostly) Accidental PR,"Every year, an old friend of mine from college and I try to get together to run a race. Usually, that race is the Richmond Marathon or Half Marathon. This year, it was the half. At that distance, my friend and I used to be more evenly matched, but I am faster these days. I'd chalk that up to my social life revolving entirely around running, whereas his revolves most around his three kids. No judgment, of course. Just the reality of a couple of late 40s guys.

At dinner Friday night, we were catching up, and H mentioned to me that he had tweaked his calf, so I was going to be running solo this year. Now, I was fully prepared to slow down and run at his pace, because I was recovering from a nasty cold that had lasted over a week, and still had a mild cough. But the thought of running a half marathon by myself, a race that I've run three times previously (I've also run the Richmond full three times), seemed kind of boring. I don't usually bother to run short races, especially big city races, unless I'm running with a friend, or have some specific goal (usually a PR) in mind.

So, I decided to PR. The night before the race. With a lingering sinus infection and cough. On training that hasn't really been half-focused (although it has been going well).

Besides wanting to PR just for something to do, the way I focus on PRs is that I focus on my oldest. My half marathon had been sitting in the ""oldest PR"" position for a year, since I set a marathon PR last year ([race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/yhwaau/the_marine_corps_marathon_an_expected_pr/)), and I still hadn't gotten around to beating it, so here was the opportunity. My old half marathon PR ([race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/8hj7md/the_frederick_half_marathon/)) was 1:42:02. I thought the best way to beat that would be to focus on getting sub-1:40, which is 7:38 per mile. Allowing for the fact that I'll end up running a little further than 13.1, let's make it 7:30.

My training runs are usually around 9:00/mile, occasionally getting into the low 8s if I'm running with fast friends. I don't usually run 7:30, but I know what it feels like: too fast.

At the race start, I let the first wave go, and got into the second wave. I noticed that the 1:45 pace group (or it might have been 1:50) was leading off the second wave, so I knew I would need to get ahead of them. But it meant that I had missed the 1:40 pace group, and they were 2 minutes ahead of me (the waves were 2 minutes apart). Oh well. Staying with a pace group is sometimes more trouble than it's worth. I started running.

Mile 1: 7:29  
Mile 2: 7:27  
Mile 3: 7:17  
Mile 4: 7:25

This being my fourth time running the half, I knew the park we entered at this point had some rolling hills. I always dread them, or at least mentally prepare for them, and they always aren't as bad as I fear. It's a nice park to run through.

Let's pause now to talk about nutrition and hydration: I thought I'd be running with H at his pace, so I didn't bother to bring any. So, I just grabbed water as I went through the aid stations.

Mile 5: 7:27  
Mile 6: 7:22  
Mile 7: 7:27

At this point, the race enters a lovely neighborhood, with cheering sections, people playing music, and usually a beer and shots stop. I debated grabbing a beer, but I still had the occasional hacking cough, a dreadfully runny nose, and the feeling that my dinner from the previous night had not entirely cleared the mechanism that morning. My race was going well, and while a beer can sometimes be helpful, I decided not to mess with success. I'd gotten halfway through the race at my goal pace, and was pretty sure I could hold onto that, even though the pace was starting to wear me down.

In fact, I was noticing something at this point. Richmond is a lovely race, whichever distance you do. But I was not having a good time. I wasn't enjoying myself. There comes a time when setting a PR means running so far out of your comfort zone that it is an absolute suffer fest for the whole distance. I mention it my race report I linked above for the last half marathon PR. I'll have to remember that feeling so I never try to set a half marathon PR again. Sure.

There was a short out and back in this section where I was able to see the 1:40 pace group not that far ahead of me. Since I had started 2 minutes behind them, I figured if I caught up to them, I'd be at a 1:38. But that would take the entire remainder of the race, so I'd be catching up to them at the finish line. I made that my goal.

I also saw my friend Eric, who I didn't know was running the race. I waved at him and said, ""Hey Eric!"" He had headphones in and didn't notice me. Fuck you, Eric. Your mustache sucks. (Just kidding, it's a magnificent mustache, and he's a great guy.)

Also, Eric is faster than me in my mental ranking of my runner friends, and I was ahead of him.

Mile 8: 7:32  
Mile 9: 7:29  
Mile 10: 7:31  
Mile 11: 7:25

I was starting to flag a bit. My legs weren't responding as well, and they felt very wooden. Mile 8 and 10 were my slowest miles, but it felt like I was still going as fast as I had gone before. Maintaining pace became a constant mental effort, in addition to the already considerable physical effort. But there was a cheering section at about 11.3 that really got me upbeat. They were at a very slight incline as we turned a corner, and they really cheered people into taking that hill. Good on them!

Everything hurt.

The race finishes on a nice downhill, although I sometimes get a little intimidated by it, because I generally do not like running downhill, especially fast, for fear I am going to fall over. That did not happen yesterday, thankfully. As I put my hand on my watch, ready to stop it as I crossed the finish, I heard the announcer congratulate the 1:40 pace group, who was just crossing in front of me. I had no idea I had gotten so close to them. I had been so focused on my pace, with my eyes completely focused on the road in front of me, so I wouldn't fall on that downhill, that I hadn't seen that I was approaching them.

Mile 12: 7:29  
Mile 13: 7:07  
0.2: 6:10 pace

I smiled. I finished in 1:37:51. About 20 seconds per mile faster than my previous PR, set in 2018 when I was in my early 40s. There will come a day when I no longer set new PRs. Yesterday was not that day.

I spent the rest of the day coughing. I've still got the same symptoms from the cold this morning. I think I'll take a break for a few days.",running

Training
I got it into my head to run a half marathon during my first semester of college when I realized none of the club cross-country races worked with my schedule. I've been running for nearly four years now, was a mediocre track and xc runner in high school, and am now a mediocre half marathoner. After researching online, I was unsatisfied with all the beginner plans that only had 3 or 4 days of running per week. I found this offensive because I've been running for 6 days a week for two years, and maintained 35 mpw over the summer. So, I made up my own training plan, and proceeded to follow it religiously. It was 11 weeks long and included building from 9 mile to 15 mile long runs, and increasing mileage from 33 to 45 mpw. The only workouts I did were building from 2 to 8 miles at goal half pace(9:09 minute mile), which often ended up being closer to 8:50 average. I typically did these the day before my long run, to practice running on tired legs. The only exception was the 8-miler, where I did 8 miles at goal pace(9 miles total), then 4 miles, then a 14-mile long run. I took a down week about a month out from the half, which conveniently occurred when I was sick and missed two days of running, and also during my midterms. Other than falling ill, I modified one other workout during my peak week, where I did a 7-mile easy run instead of 6 miles at goal pace(8 total). In general, one of my greatest strengths as a runner is consistency, which shows in how much I let my google spreadsheet rule my life. The course is also decently hilly(660 ft), so I intentionally did hilly long runs and workout runs, and often tried to include parts of the course in these runs. I did a two week taper, the first week was supposed to be easy miles but I ended up doing 2 6+ mile runs below half goal pace because I was running with much faster friends. The second week I kept it to 3-4 mile runs, and took 2 days off before race day. 

Pre-race
I made sure to get a lot of sleep on Friday night, because the half started at 7am and I tend to have trouble sleeping the night before. True to form, I got into bed at 9:15 with my alarm set for 4:20am, but did not fall asleep for at least an hour. I woke up at around 3:30, and stayed in bed until 4, at which point I decided I may as well get up. I ate some very sad instant oatmeal and drank a celsius at my desk in my dorm room, doing my best to very quiet because my roommate was fast asleep(as I wished I was). I met up with friends who were running the race at 6:05 am, and we walked the 10 minutes to the start. I did a 6 minute warmup jog and fretted about how many layers to wear. It was 30 degrees at the start, but I was committed to wearing shorts. I ultimately decided to wear shorts, a jacket over my tank top, and a headband, with plans to shed the jacket at about halfway. At 6:55, standing on the line with the 2 hour pacer, I realized I had not eaten anything since 4:30am, but also that it was too late to do anything about it, and I would just have to rely on my gels. 

Race
I shuffled across the start line and was immediately worried by how far ahead the 2 hour pacers were. I told myself I would catch them eventually and settled in, running together with my friend. I did catch them around mile 2, which is also where my physics professor caught my friend and I, and proceeded to pass us. For the first 5 miles, I chilled with the pacers, occasionally chatting with them. My friend fell behind and then caught me again. I also experienced walking through water stops for the first time. I took my gel at 30 min, as planned(I took gels at 30, 60, and 90 min). At mile 6, we hit a monster hill, but one which I had been running up regularly through my training. I tossed my jacket on the side of the road, praying I would find it later, and pulled ahead of the pacers. I instantly regretted tossing my jacket, but decided it was motivation to run faster. My friend dropped back again and I told him he wouldn't catch me again, and I was right. I settled in with 2 men, who I ended up sticking with from miles 7 to 11 or so. After mile 10, I told myself to pick it up, and was starting to think I could drop a nice 1:57 or so, as opposed to a 1:59:59. I was feeling pretty good, and decided that I should be feeling like I was dying. Mile 11 came and went and I picked it up more(Miles 12 and 13 were my quickest). At around 12, I realized I had a shot at sub 1:55 if I gassed it, so I did. My legs were shockingly ok, my body was freezing, I realized I had my first blister ever, but I persevered. At that point, it was a matter of leaving it out on the course. I could see another friend in the distance, so I focused on getting to and passing her. The last 0.25 was a bit of a blur, I saw my family who had driven up, apparently my friends were there too but I was too focused on finishing strong to notice. I sprinted across the finish line and realized I had gone sub 1:55 by a hair, which is solid given my goal was a meager sub 2. 

Post-race
My family had come bearing New York bagels for me and my friends, as well as a blanket that I was very thankful for as I staggered to the bag check. I got my things with no issues, then got a little cocky on the walk back to campus and tried to jog a little, at which point I realized how thoroughly my quads had been wrecked. I did retrieve my jacket from mile 6, which I am thankful for. After showering, I dragged myself to a coffee shop to try and refuel, and now I'm typing this instead of addressing my mountain of work that is due tonight. I don't think my professors will accept running a half marathon as an excuse. 
This half marathon was quicker than my 10k PR pace, which implies I should get out there and run a 10k soon. I do feel like I could have gone out quicker and thus achieved a quicker time, but I'm overall very satisfied with my first official half marathon. Better to have gone out a little slow and felt good the whole way than risk overdoing it early. My next big race is the Turkey Trot, where I will hopefully be able to put my brand-new aerobic base to good use.

**General overview**

I'm 47M, I live in Australia and tend to schedule destination marathons for any full marathons I do (I've run 8 marathons now and only 2 have been in Australia). i tend to run more half marathons, and didnt start running really until my mid-late 30's.

My best Full time is 4:01, and my slowest is 4:25 which was at the brutal NYCM of 2022 where it was also hot and humid, and I had already run the Marine Corp Marathon the week prior also. Have a 4:03, and then a few around the 4:07-4:12 mark. Am still hopeful of that elusive Sub 4, but am getting older now, so we'll have to see.

**Training**

Followed an 18 week improvised program, I tend to prefer high mileage so was running between 80km - 120km each week. peak week got to 150km. Had a number of races scheduled throughout, including a couple of half marathons (one a tough trail run and the other an international run in NZ). The training went pretty well and i certainly felt i had a decent base, but if im honest i wasnt quite in the shape i'd hoped to be. After running the 2 consecutive marathons in November last year my left calf caused me issues for what felt like forever, and it took around 6 months before i was back to running properly and issue free again which of course meant i'd lost a lot of conditioning, so a good proportion of the 18 weeks was just getting myself in shape as opposed to preparing properly for the day.

**Pre-race**

I flew from Melbourne to Dallas on Wednesday, camped there for a few nights and then flew into DC the Saturday morning. I had terrible jet lag after the 17 hour MEL-DFW flight and my sleeping in the days prior to MCM was terrible, barely did I get better than 3-4 hours sleep a night and the night prior to the event got 3 hours before tossing and turning the rest of the night until it was time to get up and go. It was very frustrating and I think I knew then that, combined with the weather forecast, which was for fairly hot and humid, this was unlikely to be the day I broke 4 hours.

Stayed in Rosslyn and made the quick walk to the start at around 7am, ready for the 7.55 start, i hate waiting around at start lines.

**Race**

This was my third MCM so I am familiar with the course, but it seemed really busy and crowded for the first 5km this year. I'm not sure if there were significantly more entries than last year or something around the start process had changed? almost tripped over a couple of times after foot clashes with other runners.

Settled into an OK pace, but after 2-3 miles I was already completely drenched in sweat due to the humidity. I've been training in Southern Australian winter so the humidity was ready getting to me, but I was also just feeling lethargic, I guess due to the lack of good sleep. Always loved the MCM course so just tried to settle in and enjoy the run; coming into Georgetown is always great and then the nice vibes during the out and back and the Mall. 

I was trying to focus on just keeping fueling, taking salt tabs, and keep churning through the kms at an ok pace, but I think i knew deep down there was a wall with my name on it sooner or later. Blue Mile and Haines Point was still hanging in but again, i think i knew around there that i wasnt feeling great.

By the time I got to the Mall I knew I was cooked and had to go into just get it finished mode. I remember at the time thinking about how much better i felt through the Mall section last year, and realising i still had a good 10k to go this was a pretty sobering thought. Around this time I started seeing lots of runners dropping and needing medics also, so that kinda settled things in my mind as well to just forget the clock and get to the finish.

Once I hit the bridge I started incorporating some short walk breaks, particularly through the aid stations. The last 7 or so km was a bit of a zombie shuffle, just trying to jog 700-800 meters each km. The last 800 meters I did manage to find something and got back up to 5.50min/km pace to ensure I crossed the line properly in front of the Marines.

Overall a very tough day, but rewarding to finish given the less than ideal lead up and conditions on the day.

**Post-race**

was super sore in the quads, a lot more than normally. grabbed the free beer (plus about 4 packets of the watermelon which was my savior) and sat for a while, then hobbled back to my hotel which was luckily only 10 minute walk from the finishers festival. had a nap and then went out for pizza and beer.

went to Philly and then NYC later in the week, and ran the 5km Abbott Dash to the Finish in NYC on the Saturday after MCM, the day before NYC marathon day. Ran that in 27 minutes which is well off my best though it was a very crowded run. My quads were still pretty sore though, and I remember thinking during it that I had no idea how I managed to run NYCM the weekend after MCM last year.

would definitely come back again for MCM, its a special marathon which I love, but it was a tough year.

# Training

I ran cross country in high school and would run intermittently through college but I graduated and began working in engineering and saw all of my friends who were a year or two ahead of me put on 10-30 pounds in their first year or two working and I refused to let that happen so I started running daily. It started with 2 miles on the treadmill at the gym and I realized I missed it greatly so I began to run before work as an excuse to not go to the gym and just come home after work. This began my HM training.

This subreddit and also r/AdvancedRunning preach the marathon and it is everyone's feat in running and I can see the reason it holds the prestige. However, I had little desire (still don't) to run that far ever and prefer faster races. I loosely followed a training plan including repeats and tempos and hill runs through the summer and that led me to a 1:41:50 HM at the Ashland HM in August. At the end of summer I began playing soccer 3x a week and reduced my running load to about 25 miles a week with the goal of sub 1:40 and maybe 1:35 in the back of my mind.

Mid-September I joined a HM training team for my long runs and for shake out runs on Wednesday nights but this training was focused more on finishing rather than excelling so a lot of the work I did alone or would peel off from the stop and go long runs to finish the last 5 miles by myself continuously. Besides these long runs, I ran almost everyday at 7:10-7:20 pace because it was decently comfortable for 4-7 miles and I wanted the Richmond Half to feel easy because I bonked really hard at mile 9 in my first half.  Extended my longest run to 12 miles with some hard 7 min miles incorporated in running solo, but felt the progression week to week.

# Pre-Race

I was sick with a mild sinus infection, triggered by allergies from blowing leaves last weekend, all week but I still ran through that and played less in my soccer games than I typically do. Went to war with the sinus infection and used my taper off to help me overcome that almost entirely by today. 

I ate breakfast at 5am before my 7:15 start and rode Spin scooters over to the start line from my house with my sister and partner. I queued up with the 1:35 group and started chatting with people who are using this race as part of training or as a victory lap race after Chicago or, like me, decently inexperienced at the distance and wanting some guidance towards a new best.

For once I didn't have the feeling I was about to crap my pants while at the start line, I knew this was going to be fun. Great weather, pacers reached out ahead of race day with the game plan and bios, felt rested and like a million bucks after being sick all week.

# Race

The National Anthem played with a special moment for our Veteran's today and we were off. Spirits were high and I was excited so my HR raised higher than I would have liked and I began to doubt myself for the first 5 minutes of the race on my ability to hang on to this group for the whole 13 miles. Once hitting mile 2 my HR had greatly settled down into the low 160's where it would usually sit while just out for a jog and I felt at ease just enjoying the people cheering and waving to a few friends and family members I saw along the route. Mile 5 rolls around and I'm feeling great, a few rolling hills through beautiful, still fall colored forests of Bryan Park and I feel like I can keep it up all day. 

I start my GU Energy Chews (first time using these in a race and gels ruin my stomach) around mile 6 and I use a long downhill to pull away from the pace group so I have a few slow seconds to down some gummies that became easier to chew after being in my pocket warming up for the last 45 minutes. I continue nibbling on these just cruising along taking a gummy every 20-30 seconds and all of sudden I hit mile 7 and the pace group hasn't caught up to me but given my splits they were only 10-15 seconds behind me. ""Anyways, at least I have a 10 second cushion on top of the 10 second cushion the pacers should have for us, I might need that later on a hill."" I thought to myself and kept chugging along comfortably. I look at my watch and mile 8 is fast, so is 9, and I start thinking, ""Hey, I can hold onto this and really pull away from my pace group."" 

I put my headphones in on a special playlist I made for when I got to mile 10 and would have a little over 20 minutes left just to distract me from the fatigue, and I'm rolling. I had not run this fast on any training runs and only in 2 mile spurts on the treadmill not 10 miles deep into a race but I was having a blast. I caught a hundred people in the last 5 miles of the race and just kept choosing a next person to pick off along the way. 

I turn the last corner onto 5th  street for the finish and what everyone hyped up about the downhill finish is true and I recommend everyone do the Richmond Half or full for this finish. Mile 13 is on this downhill and my headphones share with me my split of 6:26 for that mile and I am so overjoyed. I thought to myself the same level of effort in August resulted in 8:26 per mile not 6:26 after bonking and all my hard work had paid off. My family had gathered along the final stretch to cheer me on and I just had a huge grin on my face the whole way down the hill.  I crossed before the clock hit 1:32:00 and I knew I had put 3 minutes on my pace group in the last 5.5 miles of this race and finished closer to the 1:30 group than my own.

# Post-Race

I gathered my free race blanket and hat then had all of my family over for brunch of French Toast and Hash Brown Casserole. We shared pictures from the course and sidelines and congratulated each other on new bests. I cheered on some friends doing the full marathon after eating and then went out to lunch with some friends, perk of being a local.

# Final Thoughts

I was always a mediocre cross country runner in high school but am feeling more confident in my abilities as time goes on. Despite competing more now against the people who have always been committed to it, I am competing better than I used to. I am going to up the mileage through winter and hope to get a time in the spring that will help me get a slot for NYC or Chicago marathons. Today showed me that I can run fast, and if I train to run faster that I can achieve it. I hope in a year I am writing a race report for world major full or my first 1:20:00 half back here in Richmond. If you read this all I greatly appreciate it, today was the best run I've ever had and one of the few times I have felt the training paid off and was actually proud of how I ran.

1887,1699706475.0,Watches with GPS and Afib detection,"First time poster. I am an experienced youngish distance runner. Last weekend, I experienced a scary Ventricular Tachycardia event at the end of a long run that landed me in the hospital for 6 days. Long story short: I now have a subcutaneous ICD implanted but my doctors say I can continue to run once recovered! It was my fitness that helped me survive something that was quite lethal and they want me to remain just as healthy as I've been. 

My question: While I have a device that will help me if I experience dangerous arrhythmia again, I would also like to take extra precaution. I know the apple watch has the afib detector, but I am an Android user and don't want to purchase a new watch and a new phone. I currently use a Garmin 245 and am happy with it for the most part (although, the HRM was not able to read my V-tach and shows no record of my accelerated heart rate).

1894,1699646332.0,Cadence vs Zone 2--what should I prioritize?,"**TLDR:** I want to run mostly in Zone 2, but recently realized my cadence is too low. But when I increase my cadence my speed picks up and I spend almost no time in Zone 2! What should I prioritize? 

A little background: did a few 10Ks in my twenties, but am now 42 and getting back into it. 250 pounds, 6 feet tall, and hopefully getting my weight back to a healthy level. Have lost 8 pounds over the past month mostly by focusing on calories in.

I've been running for about 3 weeks and started having some inner knee pain. Lots of causes:

1. Over pronation. I bought new runners but didn't get stability, went with a neutral. I've since swapped that for a lot more cushion.
2. Heavy guy suddenly banging out 10 miles a week, was maybe too much too fast.
3. I have been cross training for 3 months now, so my legs aren't starting from zero, but obviously a long way to go.
4. Cadence is low (145) so I \*think\* I'm over striding. I want to be at 165+

So I've got a plan for 1-3, and today I tried to tackle #4. I haven't run in a week to let my knees recover, but I was keen to try a faster cadence to see how that felt. I set my watch to 165BPM and did a 2K. Watch recorded a cadence of 158 (about +9% higher than my usual).

The good news is that my knees and legs felt totally different. It was like running in a much more controlled, upright way. Felt weird and different but not bad, and no knee issues. (If anything my calves felt it a lot more, I guess they aren't used to working more!)

I ran way faster than usual and spent most of my time between Zones 3 and 4. Do I just need to tough this out and my heart rate will improve over time?

1895,1699648543.0,Anxiety and running,"Hello everyone 😁
I'm gearing up for the Honolulu Marathon in a few weeks and because I started my training so late in the year (about 3 months ago, however I do have a decent baseline for my cardio) and my very busy work/life balance (Navy), I continually miss a lot of my training runs through out the week. On a typical work day, I'm up at 230 in the morning and not getting home until almost 6 pm and I'm dead exhausted and the thought of stepping out the door for my longer runs seems dreadful and a huge undertaking. 

Some days I've been able to not think about it, lace up and start a run for a couple hours and it's no big deal. But the last two weeks where I've needed to do almost 30 miles a week, I've been slammed with anxiety and not wanted anything to do with running for multiple days in a row. 
Running is starting to feel like a burden of a chore, and not something to easy stress and anxiety like it was for me in previous years where I didn't necessarily have a goal, such as a marathon or any other race event. 

I know it's a ""no time limit"" and I'm not aiming for a particular time since it's my first event, but the thought of either, not finishing a run, or spending over 5 hours on the race course is giving me such an anxiety filled thorn in my side and it's not something I've ever really experienced before. 

Just looking for some discussion amongst fellow runners and perhaps from someone who's experienced something similar.

## Background

In the mid 1990s, I foolishly blew out my knee while training for what would have been my first marathon. I gave up running and returned to it only in January 2022, when I found myself in NYC not far from the Hudson River Greenway. My first ""runs"" were 20 seconds on, 20 seconds off, coached by the Peloton app.  I ramped up steadily and ran the Newport 5k in May 2022, then completed the 9+1 with the Staten Island Half in October to qualify for the 2023 TCS Marathon.

I hoped to make NYC my second rather than my first marathon, so I trained through the Winter and Spring of 2023 for the Fargo Marathon in May - but again my training was too aggressive, or my feet too weak, and I was felled by plantar fasciitis in April.

## Training

By June 2023 I was again running 15 miles a week in (flat) Florida. I returned to NYC for July and averaged 30+ per week in the hills of Inwood. I used Higdon's Run With Hal app to set up a plan that accommodated my work schedule and the multiple races I wanted to run, including the Bronx 10 mi (September, ran 1:24). Although I then missed 10 days of running due to (non-running related) surgery, I was able to run the SI half in October (1:52), which was sandwiched between my first 20 mile long run (rough, slow) and my second (a confidence builder) with my friends in the Palm Beach Road Runners. During my taper, I tried to adhere to Matt Fitzgerald's 10 days of high-fat/low carbs followed by 3 days of carb loading; this was probably a mistake for me as the high-fat part just weirded me out. Nutrition for the last few days - intense carb loading - was better, though I ate too much on the Friday before the race.

## Pre-race

We stayed in an old hotel on the UWS that was full of runners. On the day before the race a young woman asked me how many marathons I had run; I told her it was my first - she looked into my eyes, clearly moved, and told me that she was excited for me, and that her first marathon - also NYC - was the happiest day of her life. 

The next morning, after 30 years of waiting and a little over a year and a half of training, I woke up, had my first coffee, a banana, and a peanut butter pouch, packed up my kit and headed to the 6:15 midtown bus that would take me to SI. It was after 8 by the time I arrived; plenty of time to visit the therapy dogs, get a bagel and cup of coffee, eat one fig bar, and make my 9:45 start. (A minor mistake - I packed a few tylenols and a Nuun tablet in a plastic bag that included an unsealed wet-wipe which rendered the pills and tablets too gross to consume).

## Race

I was placed in the back of wave 2, which meant that the nearest runners to me were likely to be significantly faster than me - the nearest pacer was aiming for 3:45. But this turned out to be great, because I started at the very back of my corral, let everyone else go, and had plenty of room to chill on the Verrazano Narrows bridge.  I ran the first few miles at a pace that was a little fast (close to my 4:05 aspirational pace), but was not ridiculous.  I saw a friend in Brooklyn and gave her a hug. I gave hundreds of high fives and, because I had my name on my shirt, I received thousands of shout-outs.  The energy flowed in both ways - from the crowd to me and vice-versa; I thanked every high-fiver, had to grab a kid-spectator who wandered onto the course and into my path. 

I was running my best race, but perhaps not my fastest, and at 13.1 as we headed into Queens I realized that I was more tired than I should have been. I got a hug for and from my wife and daughter at about mile 14 and headed towards Manhattan over the Queensboro.

The crowds in Manhattan were loud, but I was hearing them less than in Brooklyn, as I focused more on the race. At about mile 16.6, reinforced by a slug of Maurten from my gel flask, I realized and yelled ""I've got this!"" and made a pact with myself not to walk. (Does walking though a few gatorade stops count?). The shout-outs that were rewarding my freshness early in the race (""**Go XXXX**!"") became, over the last miles, almost pleas, loud whispers (""*come on xxxx*"") by empathic others I could not or would not see, as I was focused on the pain in my legs and feet and butt and the determination in my head and the things that really carried me, the love in my heart for THIS CITY and its people and my family and friends who supported me through this, and the gratitude in my soul for being able to run, at my age, my first marathon.

## Lessons

I was lucky in almost every way, including the weather (it was a little warm but ok) and my placement at the back of a fast wave. With nothing new on race day I did not chafe, blister, or bleed.  I ate the right amount beforehand but consumed only 4-5 gels over the race - it should have been more. I could have used some salt tabs.   If I were to model my predicted time given my training, food, age, etc., and run 1000 simulations of this race, only a few would have been faster.

1902,1699550192.0,Post Marathon Blues,"I went through a pretty thorough training schedule after recovering from a calf injury beginning in late  June for marathon season.  This included 5x per week training and 10 weeks of 17-23 mile individual long runs.  I ran the Marine Corps Marathon on Oct. 29th and then came back the following week and ran the New York City Marathon last Sunday.  

I am giving my body a few days to recover from the back-to-back marathons and will have my first post-marathon run tomorrow.  My issue is that I feel a bit down now that I don't have any particular run to train for.  I will likely do a Spring Marathon in late April or early May, but I won't need to start really training for that until mid-January.  I, of course, plan to run 3-4x each week with weekly long runs between 7-13 miles until my next training cycle.  It just feels a bit empty with no race to look forward to for a while.  I will likely run the DC Rock-n-Roll 1/2 marathon in mid-March, but that's still 4 months away.  

So what do my peers here due to combat the ""post race blues"" and stay uplifted and motivated during what is the ""off-season"" here on the East Coast?  I need a pick-me-up.  Thanks for your thoughts.",running

1912,1699471869.0,Reasonable expectations on progress season to season?,"Hi All, last year I ran my first 2 marathons, about 4 weeks apart. No real training plan coming in to it, but was generally doing 30 to 40 MPW, one tempo run, one long run (12 to 20 miles) a week.

First marathon was 4:10, goal was to finish, second marathon was 4:00 with some learnings about nutrition both pre and intra race. The fun part to me is the trial and error! 

Is it reasonable to be reaching for goal of 3:40 for next year? I've done a lot more reading and understanding of programming, and although still VERY much a novice I am starting to understand the why and when of some programming.

Peregrines feel light, grippy, and agile, and they seem to hold up okay. Also their treads are all one single piece of material instead of being pieced together of a few different colors which seem to fall apart.

\### Training

I started working with a coach just about a year ago, coming off of my second half marathon feeling discouraged, burnt out, and frustrated after dealing with an injury in the weeks leading up to the race. I knew even this time last year that I wanted to run the New York City Marathon.  I wanted to learn how to train the right way, as I honestly had no idea what I was doing. In March, I hit a 5K PR of 22:30. In April, I was able to shave 4 minutes off of my half marathon time, coming in at 1:49:14. I had a great training cycle for that race with no injuries, and was really feeling confident and looking forward to training for the marathon. I was able to follow the entire training plan with no issues (other than the last 3 weeks..). I never had any trouble on my long runs. Did a lot of speedwork and threshold work, along with easy runs. I was able to hit my goal marathon pace in my workouts with ease. I locked down what I felt was a good nutrition strategy, as I never experienced any bonking, muscle cramping, or anything like that. I really focused on my recovery, stretching, and foam rolling. I was doing strength training 5 days a week and cross training with cycling. I also specifically did a LOT of hill training, especially in the middle of/at the end of my long runs, as I knew New York was hilly and I really wanted to be as prepared as possible. I typically look for ways to avoid hills when I'm running, but forced myself to get used to them.  I was feeling pretty confident that a sub 4 would be hard, but possible for me. I peaked around 43 miles per week and averaged around 32-35 miles per week.

About 3 weeks out from the race, I felt the familiar signs of something I had before..posterior tibial tendonitis. This time, in my other foot. The first time I had it, I was able to keep it at bay doing some exercises my coach provided and applying some heat to it. I was able to continue running. But I wasn't running nearly as much mileage as I was this time. I didn't want to take any chances so I headed straight to my PT. She advised me to cut back on my mileage in the weeks leading up to the race. I was nervous, but I knew the work had already been done. It started feeling better until I attempted a 10 mile run one week out (with her approval) - it wasn't too bad on the run, but when I woke up the next morning it was very irritated. With that being said, we decided it was best for me to take off the entire week leading up to the race, minus some light cycling. I was super anxious and frustrated in these last few weeks before the marathon.

&#x200B;

\### Pre-race

Luckily, I know someone who lives in Staten Island so I was able to sleep at her house the night before the race, saving me from having to wait around at the start village for too long. I was up early anyway, did my exercises for my PTT; it was feeling good that morning. Ate my usual breakfast of a banana and toast  (2 pieces this time) about 2.5 hours before the race. I was sipping on water, but nothing crazy as I had really made a point to hydrate with water and electrolytes this whole week. I arrived at the start village around 8:00 am. Got through security quickly, and then had about an hour to kill before making my way over to the Pink Start Village when Wave 2 corrals opened up. About 30 minutes before the race, i took some ibuprofen as one last shot to help my foot last through this race. I took a Gu 20 minutes prior. I peed 3 or 4 times the race started, so eventually I told myself to stop the water so I wouldn't have to go during the race.

\### Race

I had tears in my eyes as the cannon went off and 'New York, New York' started playing. I had been waiting for this moment for so long, and I couldn't believe it was finally here, after the months and months of training. I'm running the New York City f\*\*\*ing marathon! I was on the lower deck of the Verrazano Bridge which I didn't love. Not only were there minimal views, but the bigger problem was that the GPS on my watch did not work at all for the first 2 miles. People warned me about this, so before the race I turned off auto lap and decided to manually lap at each mile marker. 

The plan was to start conservatively around a 9:30 pace on the first mile since its an uphill, make up a bit of time on the downhill of mile 2, and then settle in around a 9:05 ish pace for the next 6 or so miles. As far as nutrition, a Gu every 30-35 minutes and alternate water and gatorade endurance at every aid station. My foot hurt immediately from the get go, but it was bearable. Without the GPS, I truly had no idea how fast i was going! I tried to focus on effort. I clocked in the first mile at 9:28 - perfect. I controlled myself on the downhill. Then I settled into my pace as we entered Brooklyn. I definitely felt as though I was holding back, which I knew was a good thing. Brooklyn was very crowded with a lot of stopping and starting and bumping into people, especially after Williamsburg where there were no barriers for the spectators, making the road very narrow. I was feeling great up until about the halfway point when I started to notice a bit of fatigue creeping in, and my thought in the back of my mind was ""I still have the Queensboro bridge to conquer"". I had been so worried about this stupid bridge all through training. I also realized I was starting to feel thirsty and that concerned me. I started taking 2 cups at some of the fluid stations. I didn't understand why - I felt like I had adequately hydrated before the race.

Finally, it arrived - the dreaded Queensboro Bridge. I somehow had NO problem with it at all. I barely even felt it. I think the hills I ran during my training turned out to be a lot longer and steeper. I actually enjoyed the break from the crowds for a minute. I was so happy that I was feeling good at this point, as I was sure this would break me.  Eventually, I started to hear the crowds roaring from First Avenue as we descended the bridge. I stayed controlled with my pace, looking forward to seeing my friends and family around mile 17. I was feeling great when I saw them!

All of a sudden at some point between mile 18 and 19, I looked at what was in front of me and realized First Avenue is pretty much a full uphill - gradual, but a long hill. As I approached mile 19, my calves started to cramp uncontrollably. I didn't realize what it was at first, as I had never experienced this before. My breathing felt controlled, my mind didn't feel tired - but my legs were giving out. I had to stop and stretch them out in order to keep going. Thus began my run/walk/stretch combo for the rest of the race. I was so disappointed as I didn't think I would have to stop and walk at all. But the cramping was too painful. I'd get a surge for a bit and then have to stop again. It was discouraging at first. But once I accepted that my A goal was now out of reach, I decided to just keep going and do the best I could, walking or not. Take in the crowds, and just enjoy the experience. So that's what I did. Ran as much as I could, and stopped and walked when I needed to.

The Bronx was a bit of a blur but I do remember the crowd support being amazing. At this point i was grabbing 3 or 4 cups from every aid station, and a random water bottle from a child. I saw the ""last damn bridge"" sign and as happy as i was, i knew there was still Fifth Avenue to conquer. I don't even remember feeling much of this hill since i was both running and walking at this point. I knew my family and friends were going to be around 95th street between mile 23 and 24, so once i knew that was coming, i forced myself to keep running. It helped.  A lot. 

Finally I entered central park and I at least knew at this point I was going to make it. The crowds in here were electric. Around mile 25, I stopped at an aid station and all of a sudden my quad completely locked up. I couldn't move my leg. The volunteer at the station asked if I needed help getting to the medical tent and I guess I said yes. She helped me cross over and they sat me down, applied something to my leg (maybe biofreeze? im not sure) had me take some salt, and were able to get the cramp out. I lost 4 minutes there. Again, something that I had never experienced before but it was so incredibly painful.

I got back into the race and finished as strong as I possibly could. I barely even noticed the hills in the park because I was just going on adrenaline. Once i saw the 400m to go sign, I got in the final push I needed to cross the finish line.

\### Post-race

As proud of myself as I was for finishing, I would be lying if I said i wasn't a little disappointed. But at the same time, this was my first marathon and I had no idea how my body was going to react. I was glad that I now know what to expect for next time, what I need to address, and what I need to do differently. I was just so glad I finished as all of my anxiety leading up to the race was surrounding whether my PTT would allow me to finish - who knew that instead, it would be cramps that would lead to my downfall. The PTT was present throughout the entire race, but I was actually distracted from it in the second half due to how bad the leg cramping was. I also stressed so much about the Queensboro - and it turns out, 1st Ave was my downfall.

Overall, it was an amazing experience and a race I would definitely run again - in 2025 - I want to try out a flatter course first next year. I also am planning on taking off from running for as much time as I need to get my PTT under control so that I can get back into it as healthy as possible. But i'm glad i did it!

1927,1699372945.0,Tips for running app/audio coach that allows for simultaneous podcast/music (beginner),"I'm looking for tips on running apps/audio coaches for a beginner runner; I went from 0 to 5k half a year ago with the help of a running podcast, and want to take up running again, but repeating the same podcast sounds a tad boring.

Ideally, I'm looking for an app where I can plan the routine myself (i.e., 5 min walk, 5 min jog, 30 sec walk, etc.) with a voice telling me when to run/walk, and in a way where it's possible to listen to a podcast or music at the same time. 

Does anyone have recommendations for such an app? I've tried googling but haven't had any luck. Free is preferable, but a price up to $20 is also fine, as long as it does the job.

1928,1699383832.0,Polarized 80/20 - tips for the 20?,"Hi!

I'm currently in week 4 of my training with the polarized method 80/20 and so far I'm finding myself improving in terms of aerobic capacity, I can run the Z2 faster under the same bpm conditions.

For the 20 part I have tried a couple of things but I'm not very happy with what I'm seeing so far, thus I wanted to ask for some opinions here.

I have been focusing on either 10x500m intervals with 1'15 - 1'30 rest, the last 200m of the series I try to go faster to get that anaerobic zone training. I have also tried fartlek with 4'+3'+2'+1' with 1' active recovery in between and finally Ihave tried 10x250m intervals with 1' recovery.

The problem that I see is that none of those seem to be working for me in terms of getting my BPM high enough. Today during my 500m session I managed to get a max of 159bpm going at a rythm of 3'40min/km (way above my target race pace). I also get the feeling of tiredness by reaching the 7th or 8th interval.

What would you recommend me doing? Any answers are welcome as I'm trying to improve my knowledge and train better. Many thanks!",running

1934,1699322775.0,Moab Trail Marathon: reflections from the back of the pack,"If someone had told me a year ago that I would voluntarily enter the Moab Trail Marathon in November 2023, actually complete it, and have a great time, I would have laughed in their face. I only started running about a year ago, after my partner (himself an ultra runner) told me that you’re allowed to go slow when you run. You can even walk if you want. And you get to eat lots of snacks. Feats of extraordinary athleticism that take years of intense commitment, training, and drive? No thanks, not for me. Long days in nature, with cookies? Sign me up!

My training “plan” consisted of looking at approximately 1000 actual training plans, reflecting on the likelihood of my actually sticking to them (low), and then taking their general shape and adapting it to fit with my schedule (busy) and my goals (finish before the 8:30 cutoff time with my body in one piece, and enjoy my time on the trail, Type 1 fun preferred, Type 2 fun acceptable). I landed on a 3-4 days per week schedule: solo road run from my house most Tuesdays, social trail run with the ladies most Thursdays, and longer trail adventures most Saturdays and/or Sundays. I started with (very) low mileage and crept my way up, taking a “step back” week every three weeks or so and eventually plateauing at 25-30 mile weeks, with occasional 35+ mile weeks (which generally involved back-to-back 10+ mile runs on the weekend).

Early in my running, I used Strava to keep track of my pace, with the intent of eventually getting a cool GPS watch. But I found that I was getting caught up in trying to beat my previous times, and I was getting frustrated when my progress didn’t seem linear, so I bailed on the tech altogether and ran by perceived exertion instead. I parked myself in zone 2 and pretty much stayed there. Occasionally I played with fartleks, but speed workouts, tempos, and race pace weren’t part of my training plan. My pace has increased by a little bit, which is neat, but the ease with which I can run at a slow and steady pace for a long time is borderline unbelievable to me, as a person who really doesn’t self-identify as an athlete.

Anyway, the enthusiasm of the local trail running community (and my own semi-morbid curiosity) sucked me in, and I signed up for a couple of long races before Moab for the experiential learning opportunities they offered.

The Siskiyou Out Back 50K (yes, I’m the dummy who skipped the marathon and went straight to an ultra) in July 2023 taught me to eat. Like, a lot. I just about ran out of gas around mile 19. Bless my partner for sticking with me and coaxing me along to the next aid station, where some ginger ale settled my nausea and got enough calories on board to rally and push through to the end. This race also taught me to drink more water. General overwhelm made me cry somewhere around mile 27, but I'm pretty sure there wasn’t enough water in my body to spare for tears. Weird sensation, would not recommend. Aside from fueling issues, my primary regret was not stopping to take in the wildflowers and the views more thoroughly. If you’re gonna trot yourself 16 miles out to a spectacular place before you turn back and head home, take some time to take it in.

The Point Mariah Trail Marathon in August 2023 taught me to consider race day logistics more carefully. Waking up at 4:00 am in a remote cabin after having slept on a questionable futon, hiking 20 minutes to the car, and driving 2 hours to get to packet pickup before 7:00 am sucked. I also learned about setting emotional expectations with regard to the other runners in my party. I drank enough water this time that when I started crying at mile 23 because my friends were soooo far ahead of me and had probably already been finished for an hour and here I was slogging sadly through the woods alone, there were actual tears. (I caught up to my friends in mile 25.) Highlights included chatting to the big beautiful snake sunning herself in the trail, watching the hummingbird hawk-moths work the red wildflowers, and hanging upside down on a swing overlooking the spectacular Royal Gorge.

These lessons served me well in Moab. I ran, hiked, and butt-scooted my way around that 26.1 mile course in 7 hours and 17 minutes, and I felt great about it. I fueled successfully and hydrated appropriately (difficult in the desert!), and although I was tired toward the end, it never felt like a death slog. Around the halfway point, I was actually disappointed that it was going to be over so soon. By mile 16, I had the trail to myself — a major plus for an introvert like me. In the final 4 miles, I passed a whole bunch of other runners, so I know I paced myself well. I crossed the finish line with a spring in my step and a huge grin on my face.

I had stopped to marvel at the views (which were absolutely extraordinary around literally every turn) and I’d encouraged other runners to do the same, when it was tempting to just keep eyes on the trail and pick careful lines. I’d paused to peer into weird rock caves, to watch tiny lizards scampering across the slickrock, and to pick up trash that other runners had dropped. I had snapped photos of the places where the course surprised me into a laugh (hello slot canyons and steep scrambles) and those that took my breath away. I’d taken a break at the top of the longest climb of the race (1200’ in about a mile and a half) to swap phones with another runner so we could each have our picture taken on top of the world. I had spent pretty nearly all of those 7 hours and 17 minutes having Type 1 fun. I was so proud of myself.

But then I got caught up in the “go fast” culture. My older brother ran the race too. He hadn’t trained at all, and he finished in under 6 hours. He talked about how great it had felt to go flying down the technical singletrack, how hiking up the big hill had rejuvenated him, how he’d cried tears of joy over a bag of potato chips at one of the aid stations. I was genuinely happy for him, and it also made me feel absolutely terrible about myself. I had bent over backwards to get my training runs in during my busy work season. I had done everything in my power to keep up with my calories, to keep moving, to finish before the official cutoff of 8:30. And still, he did “better” than I did, and by an embarrassingly wide margin.

I should mention: my brother is a serious athlete, a rock climber who’s put in years of intense commitment, training, and drive, and who cross-trains with mountain biking three days a week. He’s a pro at asking his body to do hard things, and he’s in disgustingly great shape. He’s also a local for this race — he lives in Moab and when he walks the dog or goes out on his bike, sometimes it’s on the actual course that we ran. But still, I bought into the whole “the fastest runners ran the best race” thing. I hadn’t cried on the course, but I cried that night, lying on the couch in my brother’s house. The more I thought about it, the worse I felt about my performance.

So I called in for an emotional assist from my partner. He reminded me that I had run the exact perfect race that I trained for. He asked: “What do you wish you had done differently?” And the only answer I had was that I wished I hadn’t compared myself to my brother. Everything else was amazing. With that perspective, I became proud of my accomplishment again. I wouldn’t say that I crushed the race, but I sure gave it a loving squeeze. I experienced that course fully and whole-heartedly, in a way that was meaningful to me; I got to be truly present in an extraordinary place, and take my time, and soak it all in. I made good choices for my body and my mind from start to finish. I exceeded my goals: not only did I finish before the cutoff time with my body in one piece and enjoy my time on the trail, I finished more than an hour before the cutoff time, with my body feeling fantastic, and with a stack of spectacular memories that I’ll carry with me for the rest of my life.

All of this is to say — if you’re fast, that’s cool. But there’s a lot to be learned from being an unapologetically happy finisher at the back of the pack.",running

### Training
2023 was my first serious year of running (and racing): I’ve always loved sports and I had a competitive Powerlifting and Rowing past. I began running as cross training but I suddenly fell in love with it: I started with 3 times per week, then 4 and finally 6 days a week, building volume while following a 60mpw Pfitz Base Building Plan. Running became a passion.
In January 2023 I decided to start training for my first race: an Half Marathon scheduled in April 2023. I trained for it following Hansons HM method (peaking at 60mpw): I really loved the method and I was very happy with the result, I finished my HM race in 01:32:06. After the race I followed a new base building plan peaking at 65mpw.
After a 2 weeks heel injury, in July, I decided to start training for a first Marathon in my hometown (Turin, Italy), scheduled in November. I had only 13 weeks of training, I knew it could be a very short training block but I decided to try.
I bought Pfitzinger book “Advance Marathoning” and I used his 12/70 program for my first November Marathon. I started the Marathon Training Block at the end of July: I’m honest, marathon training (and above all Pfitz 12/70 template) hit me like a train at the start of the Block: we had a terrible hot summer in Italy and running in the heat was a struggle. I decided to pick a marathon goal of 03:10:00 and this is the summary of the block:

- I had to adjust immediately my MP pace for the heat. All MP long runs didn’t go well, I had to really slow down all of them to complete the runs (4:45 the first, 5:09 the second and the worst one and finally again 4:45 for the last one, so all of them far from my goal pace). In August the temperature was always above 30/32 C (86/90 F), I left out pace and I tried to run by effort. Even if I was a bit discouraged about my MP runs and doubtful about the success of my training, i stuck to the plan to the letter without never skipping a run and completing always the prescribed mileage. 

- following some advices I read here, I decided also to run the Midweek Long Runs and the Long Runs slower than Pfitz paces (20%-10% slower than MP). They resulted as a sort of easy runs with a faster finish (average pace for them 25% slower than MP). The two 21mi/20mi in the plan were hard and I began to question if I was ready for the full distance.

- With time the training went better (like climbing a mountain and finally see the top), I had a good big workout (12mi w/7mi LT which I ran with a 4:15 min/km pace, in line with a 03:10 goal according to vdot calculator) and two great Tune-up races at the end of the block that, for work and family commitments, I had to run as solo Time Trials (40:48 10k and 31:42 8k two weeks later). After this results, runanalyze predicted a 03:05 marathon, vdot calculator a 03:08. I felt those predictions were too optimistic and I set a goal of trying to finish my Marathon in 03:15.

- I supported all my Marathon block with strength training: two weight sessions on hard days (focusing on quads/glutes/hams/calves) and 4 SAM Routines on easy days (focusing on mobility/core/hips). I stopped all weights two weeks before my marathon and the Sam Routine on race week.

### Pre-race
I was really excited in race week, but also very scared about the distance and all the variables that could happen in a Marathon. I spent days trying to understand if my goal time was too optimistic or too conservative: the taper was a strange-one, I didn’t feel very confident but I knew it is normal. I decided to not carb load but to follow my usual nutrition plan (with some more carbs throughout the day but not a proper carb load protocol). The day before the race I had a good carb meal at lunch, some carbs also at dinner and I went to bed early. I slept quite well (considering my anxiety and excitement were growing hour after hour) and I woke up 3 hours before the race. I ate a 450kcal breakfast (some bread and jam with a coffee), I drank 1L of water with some electrolytes and it was time to go to the race with my wife (who has always supported me during all my training and she was with me also in this beautiful day). I arrived one hour before the start, I warmed up with some dynamic exercises and it was time to reach the corral.

### Race
After the start I didn’t feel that magic sensation I had during my first HM “wow, so this is the taper effect…I’m flying!”….instead I felt a little bit empty so I decided to be conservative and run the first 5km 10sec. slower (4:45 min/km) than my MP goal. Then a thought came into my mind, after reading all the posts in Reddit about the first marathon: “a marathon starts at 32km” and “a marathon is 32km of warm up followed by 10km of hell”. Suddenly I decided to keep that very conservative pace (10 sec. slower than goal pace) until 32km and than evaluate…the first HM was easy and smooth, I started contemplating the chance to pick up the pace but I decided to wait for the 32km mark. I’m so happy with this decision…at 30km I started to feel my legs heavy, aerobically I was fine but I felt that my legs muscles were slowly abandoning me…i knew my 03:15 goal was impossible, but I bite the bullet, I tried to find all the strength I had in me and above all I tried to keep my mind strong while I was seeing other runners stopping. Km 32/39 were a torture, my piriformis (that started to annoy me at 10km) began to really hurt, I felt pain in my hams up to my right foot but I was able to not stop, I ran till the end and I was also able to accelerate the last km. 03:25:51 wasn’t my dream time, but I felt so proud to finish the race without stopping running. The Marathon is the hardest accomplishment I did in my life….I cried at the end thinking about all I have found inside of me to reach the finish line. I was very happy also with my nutrition/hydration during the race, I managed to eat 66g of carbs per hour and I drank water/electrolytes (from 15km) at every aid station.

### Post-race
I hug my wife…I drank some tea with sugar and after a 20min walk to our car it was time to come back home. We had a beautiful day together: we had a good meal and then we both felt asleep :). I think this great community (with all the great advices I read) is the number one reason I finished the race without really hitting a “no return wall”. I didn’t reach my A goal but B goal made me incredibly happy and proud. 

Now I’m thinking about my future running plan and it’s time for me to analyze my training block: Pfitz 12/70 was an incredible experience, it made me a so much strong runner and the two Time Trials/Tune up races were very big results for me. But I think also that 12 weeks was not enough time for my first Marathon and for the future I’m also thinking to give Hanson Marathon Method a try, given the very positive experience I had for the Half Marathon.

My plan for the immediate future is to slowly build to 70mpw again and then training for a spring HM and again a November Marathon.

For my future Marathon training (and the goal to go sub 03:15 or even 03:10), considering this first experience, which could be the things I have to change or focus? More long faster runs (considering the fading of my legs at 32km)? More MP work (but for the next marathon I had to train again in summer, especially in July/August)? Go with Pfitz 18/70 or switch to Hansons method? Other tips/advices?

Thanks a lot for your time and sorry for my bad English!

We're trying to take advantage of one of New Reddit's features, collections. It lets the mods group posts into Collections. We're giving it a try on posts that get good feedback that would be useful for future users. We've setup some common topic Collections and will add new posts to these as they arise as well as start new Collections as needed. Here's the link to the wiki with a list of the current Collections.
