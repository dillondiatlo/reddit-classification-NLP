1,1552749074.0,Don't do Underwaters Alone,"I'm a paramedic.

Last night, on duty, we were called to a local gym and indoor pool facility for a teenager found drowned in the pool.

He was alone. Nobody knew how long he'd been under. Some gym goers walking by noticed he was just floating under the water and grabbed him out. 

They did CPR, and thankfully, by the time I got there, he was wide awake but in a lot of pain. 

He admitted to me later that he was trying to swim long lengths underwater and his last memory was trying to come up for air and then nothing. 

He experienced a shallow water blackout. Essentially, when you are trying to do long distances underwater, you can hyperventilate to maximize your oxygen intake and blow off much of your CO2, thus reducing the feeling of 'i need to surface for air' during your laps. 

But what ends up happening sometimes, is that you overdo it, and you end up expelling too much CO2. Then, as you are doing your lap, your brain becomes oxygen deprived, but the CO2 level in your body is too low for your brain to signal you to breath. 

And, without any warning, lights go out. No slow fade into darkness, no slow feeling of passing out. No, you pretty much just go out in a matter of seconds.

...

At the hospital, my patient's father expressed shock to me that this happened to his kid. His kid is an incredible competitive swimmer, one of the best in his age group. It didn't make sense that he nearly drowned. He could understand some rookie, but his kid? In a pool that was maybe 5 feet deep? 

I told him yes, his kid, in a shallow pool, surrounded by other people. He almost lost his life before he even started it in earnest. 

Don't. Train. Underwaters. Alone.",Swimming

I've always had it in my mind, from when I first went back, that I just don't have the lung capacity to keep swimming without needing to catch my breath after every 50m. I smashed that a while ago, and usually do 200m and then have a 20sec breather, but I've been convinced I can't do more than one lap without needing to breathe every 2nd stroke.

Now, I was taught every 3rd and it feels natural to me and I feel stronger and like my technique is better when I do swim that way, however today was the first day I did my entire 45min swim breathing this way and you know what? It felt great.

That's all.

I had been cycling (e-biking because I can‚Äôt get up the hills in my area unassisted) for exercise, but even this was causing injury to my back and knees.  For about the past year I have worried that I finally reached the point of no return, where I had destroyed my health to a point where it would not be possible to get healthy again...and then my dad suggested swimming...and I tried it.  

I started going to my local community center pool the week of Labor Day.  At first, just three days a week to walk in the water, then four days a week adding some water aerobics and crunches, and later added in some very slow lap swimming.  For the past two weeks I have gone every day, and I‚Äôm up to 12 laps plus a bit of water aerobics.  And...
I FEEL INCREDIBLE!!! I went from barely being able to get out of bed in the morning and having to take Aleve most days for the pain in my back and knees, to being able to wake up without pain and walk a couple miles without a problem.  

I feel incredible mentally too, which I didn‚Äôt expect.  Even on days when I enter the pool full of anxiety, there‚Äôs something about the rhythm of breathing in and then blowing out bubbles that clears my head and settles my emotions.  I have yet to have a day when I leave the pool feeling anything other than settled and calm.  

I‚Äôm obviously going to be obese for awhile, and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve lost any weight because I can‚Äôt make it about that.  Any weight I lose will be a big bonus, but I am trying to keep my focus on how good I feel and how much pleasure I get from the swimming itself.  I‚Äôm so glad I tried it - I feel like I have some hope now of being able to change myself, and that hope is making a huge difference in my motivation.",Swimming

My last set was some sprint 50s. When I finished I was swimming slow (apparently too slow) to loosen up before hopping out of the pool. As I was gliding to the end of the pool on my back something hit me in the head.  The lifeguard stopped me with her rescue buoy and asked me if I was doing ok and if I needed any help and that it ooked like I was struggling.  I thanked her for her concern and laughed.

356,1602618390.0,I swam a 13K today!,"My longest swim ever. 

4:23:14

My plan was to do a 10K. It would‚Äôve been my 5th. I did the first 4700m without stopping and I felt quite good. That‚Äôs when I got it into my head that maybe I should do more. 

I started out thinking, ‚ÄúWell, maybe I could do an 11K.‚Äù That would take me around 3:35-40. So then I thought, ‚ÄúI wonder how many meters a 7 mile swim is?‚Äù In my head, I calculated it should be ~11,250m (it‚Äôs actually 11,265.41 for anyone who‚Äôs wondering). ‚ÄúI could do that.‚Äù 

Then I thought, ‚ÄúHmmm. My first 10K took just shy of 4 hours. Maybe I should just do a 4 hour swim. That would be my longest swim (time-wise) ever.‚Äù 

Then I thought a bit more and considered, ‚ÄúWhat about 8 miles? How many meters is that?‚Äù I again calculated in my head, but decided that on my next bathroom break, I‚Äôd find out for sure. When I did I found that 8 miles = 12,874.75 meters. 

To do that, I‚Äôd have to do another 2000m. I decided to go for it. But then, right when I started on that last 2000, I realized a 13K was just a few more laps and figured, I might as well do that.

Whenever I would try to lose weight I would be unsuccessful because I would always have something come up in my life that would make it difficult to eat well and going to the gym would be something awful to me.

Then, I realized that swimming is exercise and it all clicked. I have so many fond memories swimming, I remember my parents forcing me out of the water on the beach because even though the water was freezing and would give me hypothermia I had a need to be in the water. So I am taking lessons at the local Y, I am practicing every day. And things have gotten tough in my life but I am still on track, because I want to do even better in the water, I can‚Äôt binge on Oreos, because I now have the goal of being a long distance swimmer and I need things that will fuel me.

Wish I had learned this very important life skill earlier in life; but growing up in a rural area and without much disposable income posed a huge barrier.  Swimming can be a difficult activity to access for some communities!

Sunday morning rolls around, and I had the morning heat of the 1650. Swam my 1650, swam a best time, life was good. Went to my coach, asked if I'd be on the 400fr relay that evening, as I knew I was right around the #8/9 spot, fighting for that last spot on the B-relay. He said I wasn't going to be on it, so I precedded to cool-down maybe 200yd after my race. I had retired.

Evening swimming comes around, I have a fun session watching the team swim and enjoyed my retirement. During the diving break, about 30 minutes before the 400fr relay, my coach comes up to me, and says he *accidentally* entered one of our swimmers in 5 relays, and that he wasn't eligible for the last relay. I was on the B-relay. I didn't bring a suit or towel to the pool. I borrowed a suit, warmed up, and got ready for the race. I was the happiest kid in the world just getting a chance to swim on that relay.

Boy did I swim that relay. I was the 3rd leg, and on the first 50, I swam a best time in the 50 to my feet, and then preceded to swim a lifetime best in the 100 by **1.6 seconds.** I ended my career with one of the best swims of my life. That is all, just wanted to share

Let‚Äôs face the facts: Men, on average, are built stronger, taller, and have a more robust cardiovascular/respiratory system.

I‚Äôm all for inclusion of transgender individuals in sports, but I think there should be a system in place to level the playing field based off of physical limitations.

I don‚Äôt want to discourage athletes from participating in sports they love, nor do I want to single out any individual groups. I just feel like there needs to be a more inclusive way to allow athletes to compete together fairly.

Is this an unpopular opinion? Am I wrong for feeling bad for these young ladies who got absolutely demolished?

Yesterday we had a drill set with snorkels where we do ‚Äúside-kick‚Äù. Eyes are down, and the rest of the body is on its side. The point is to get the kids kicking full range from their hip, not the knees. Unfortunately, we had one swimmer misinterpret the drill. 

But to a wholly unprecedented level.

They put on their snorkel, and left on their interval, as they should have. But they pushed off on their back. 

And then stayed on their back.

With a snorkel on.

She knew something was wrong after a few seconds, and was inhaling nothing but water, but STAYED on her back! She looked up at me, and started laughing as I yelled at her. Mind you, I wasn‚Äôt actually angry, just bewildered. 

I was cracking up. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing!? You can‚Äôt snorkel on your back!‚Äù

She says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to use a snorkel!‚Äù

‚ÄúClearly!‚Äù I replied ‚Äúthe drill is with your eyes down!‚Äù

It took her another 25 to understand. She did eventually figure it out, though. But the horror of the moment remains: What does this mean for the future of America? /s",Swimming

593,1530019018.0,"I am Jemma Lowe, Double Olympian and British Record Holder, here are some tips for the 200m Butterfly.","After racing in the 200m Butterfly over 100 times, I still had some doubt that I may not finish the race. Seems crazy!?

Any swimmer that swims a 200m Butterfly knows how difficult this event can be and especially if you get the pacing wrong. Pacing the 200m Butterfly can be very tricky to get right, which sometimes I still struggled with after years of experience. Even at major events, such as the World Championships, I messed up my pacing and ended up missing medals, finals and hurting a lot! It happens to even some of the most experienced swimmers.¬†

However, those times you do manage to get that pacing right, there's no better feeling than smashing your best time, qualifying for an event or even winning a medal! Those are the feelings that keep us swimmers going.¬†

Here are some of my tips to increase your chance of having a great 200m Butterfly swim:

* Have a plan and stick to it. It can be very easy to get excited, go out too fast and then die off at the end. Believe in your plan and don't let emotions get in the way.
* 1st 50m- Long, Strong and Relaxed. Saving energy in that first 25m is crucial in preventing that 'dying' at the end. In a race no swimming should ever be slow, there's no time for that, you want to have that 'easy speed'.
* 2nd 50m- Build, keep those arms relaxed and start to increase your speed slightly into that second turn.
* 3rd 50m- Increase the legs, start to kick harder and increase that stroke rate slightly.
* 4th 50m- The Last turn wants to be the fastest as well as fast fly kick off the wall, building again to a MAX finish, keeping hold of the water every stroke.
* Nail every turn by spotting the wall 10m out. Hitting the wall too close or too far away can mess up the whole swim and cause you to use up more energy, spot those walls and finish on a full stroke.
* Save the legs for the second half of the race.
* Never expect a 200m Butterfly to be easy, it's always going to hurt, slow or fast!
* Believe in yourself and try to look forward to it, dreading the race will only make it harder.
* Probably the most important.... do the right amount of training for a 200m Butterly, aim to do main sets on Fly and get the hours in the pool!

Last month I flew over the handlebars of my bicycle and broke my elbow in half. Open fracture. Needed emergency surgery to repair. I‚Äôve been rehabbing and thought about where my strength comes from. 

It started when I was 7 years old. 
At 8am in a cold swimming pool. Every day in the summer. When most little kids were sleeping in and getting a relaxing summer morning. I was learning how to swim lengths of the pool with no breath. I was learning that muscles ache when you work them hard. I was learning about character building. 

At least that‚Äôs what coach told us. We‚Äôd ask ‚Äúwhat are we doing this for?‚Äù He‚Äôd say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre building character‚Äù. We‚Äôd respond ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs character?‚Äù

We swam no breathers in meets to be rewarded with a full size Snickers bar. It was everything. I also did it to make my dad proud. And he was. Very proud. He gave me big bear hugs when I finished. We‚Äôd look at my time together. 

It was a lot of fun. It was also really hard. We were small. But we were tough. And it built the character and strength I needed to get through not only this, but all the trials of life. I won‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs only me. God has carried me through all of it. But, swimming gave me the fortitude.",Swimming

For context, I began learning how to swim a little over a year ago. Even with my instructor, the deep end (a little over 10 feet deep at the Olympic style pool I swim in) was an anxiety-provoking situation. 

Thus, I spent the majority of my swimming months doing continuous half laps, religiously turning back right at the start of the mid-way point when it got more than four feet deep. 

Today, nudged by a supportive colleague, I incrementally increased my lengths until I finally did continuous laps from the deep end. 

I‚Äôm still working through the fear but the joy is just splendid. I now look forward to even longer laps. 

Thought I would share my small achievement with this supportive community. Let me know about your first time in the deep end.

627,1450334891.0,PSA: There is no advice we can give you that will make you drop X seconds in Y event by tomorrow.,"Time drops in events come as a result of three primary things:  fitness increases from training, technique improvements from drills/training, and peaking from resting/tapering. 

Fitness is fitness. Work hard in practice. Sleep well. Eat a balanced diet. Do ab work/dryland/weights. Drink water through out the day to stay hydrated. Tapering and resting will come in another few months. If you have a history of chronic injury, take care of it before it becomes a problem. Missing pool time is the fastest route to not improving. 

Now comes to technique. There are no shortcuts. Technique refinements take just as much mental effort and focus as the hardest intervals. Changing technique is like breaking a habit. You want to drill it enough that you never have to think about it in a race. Thinking is SLOOOOOOW. You want to be able to react and swim 100% on muscle memory. 

Now is a great time to start focusing on technique improvements EVERY DAY in practice. Pick ONE thing each day to work on. It is way too hard to try and fix 10 things at once. Pick one each day. Warm up is a great time to really work on technique and not worry about missing an interval. If you can't do something well during warm up, what makes you think you can do it well during a race? 

Also find opportunities to work on good technique every where. Every time you push off the wall to start an interval is an opportunity to work on the second phase of open turns. Every flip turn in practice is an opportunity to work on not breathing that first stroke and having a clean break out. (Pro tip:  take your first stroke with the hand on the bottom of your streamline, and make that hand your non-preferred breathing side). For IMers out there, use IM sets to work on stroke transitions.

Feel free to keep post questions about improvements, times, and technique, just know that there is no silver bullet to get that sectional or state of trials cut time.

However I recently embarked on some self-discovery and found out that I may be MtF transgender and have begun talking with a professional therapist about going on estrogen HRT and socially transitioning. However seeing some of the opinions people on this sub have about transgender people, especially after the whole Lia Thomas story, I feel extremely worried coming as a swimmer and the last thing I want is to make all my teammates hate me. I'm not transitioning because I want to ""cheat"" and ""steal a bunch of records from cisgender female athletes"", but rather just because I want to be my true authentic self. I honestly wouldn't even care if I had to compete against males at meets, just as long as I didn't get bullied and harassed: I'm in this to swim, not to win. I could just say that as a transgender athlete, swimming, a sport with a strong dichotomy between M and F, simply isn't for me and that I should just move on, except that it has been a very big part of my life for the greater part of a decade and it's not just something that I can just give up that easily. However at the same time I don't want to continue having to pretend to be a person that I'm not just to exercise, casually compete, and have fun. 

I am writing this post and throwing all this out here, because I want to get the opinions of others. I want to how comfortable people would feel if they had a transgender athlete on their team, so I can have an idea of what I'm getting into with making this life decision. Thank you",Swimming

Just feeling the need to tell someone.","I am an obese 42y/o female, and I started swimming last September as a way to improve my range of motion and overall cardiovascular health, mainly because I had gotten to the point where most other forms of exercise had become impossible for me because of my weight.  At that time, I set myself the goal of swimming 2800m by August of 2020 in order to participate in an organized swimming event (my first).  

I went from barely being able to swim 250m to swimming daily 1200m daily by November, and I thought I‚Äôd have my goal well in hand by August...and then I got pneumonia and ended up being hospitalized in early December.  It took quite awhile to come back from that, but I started swimming just a few laps again in late January and have been making 1000m daily again, with the hopes of increasing my distance by 100m per week.  I thought I would have *just* enough time to work up to the 2800m distance by the date of the event, but now due to COVID19 the pools have closed.  By the time they reopen, I won‚Äôt have enough time to increase my distance, and I just don‚Äôt see a way that I‚Äôll be able to reach my goal.  

I am unbelievably, almost stupidly disappointed.  Swimming has been the source of real mental and physical health improvements for me - I had lost most of my anxiety, for once I had been feeling like the kind of person who could set a goal and actually accomplish it instead of a total failure, and my body feels better than it had for years prior to swimming.

671,1357718394.0,The Most Common Freestyle/Front Crawl Errors I see at all levels and what can be done to correct them.,"I'll preface this as saying, for those of you who do not know, I've been a competitive swimmer for 10+ years, culminating in a 4 year NCAA D3 career. I also taught Red Cross swim lessons for 7 years. Take my opinion for what you will.

I will, from this point forward, refer to the ""front crawl"" as freestyle. Sorry TheGreatCthulhu, this is just a habit that will never die.

The freestyle is generally broken down into phases: Entry, Catch, Pull/Power, and the Recovery. The entry is when the hands are entering the water out front, extending and reaching. Then the Catch happens when the forearm and hand drop and anchor on to the water. The Pull/Power phase is when the lats really engage and accelerate the body. The Recovery is when the hands have reached the hips and are done pulling and are raised out of the water to begin the cycle over.

**1) Rotation:**

Early on in the instruction of children and new swimmers, much attention is drawn, in my opinion incorrectly, to the shoulder rotation of the freestyle. In fact, more attention should be focused on the hips and full body rotation. Swimming is a full body activity, and every stroke requires rhythmic motions of the entire body. Novice swimmers often focus on just rotating the shoulders, while leaving the hips relatively stationary. This is incorrect and inefficient. The proper freestyle technique is that in which the entire body rolls side-to-side, the rotation of which is being lead and driven by the hips, abdominals and lower back. Think of your entire body being on a roasting spit like a pig. You will then rotate about this long axis as you make your way down the pool.

Here is a video of Ian Thorpe (greatest 200/400/800m swimmer ever) swimming: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv_sDYHYzFw

Notice how his hips and shoulders rotate together. His whole body smoothly transfers momentum from side-to-side as he swims forward. The ideal freestyle would evenly rotate to each side, but this is never usually the case. Every swimmer has a preferred breathing side, and you will tend to rotate more towards that side, especially when trying to breathe. Even the world's best swimmers have a dominant side. That is OK. 

Notice also how Thorpe is looking forward and down while he swims. He's looking at about a 30-45 degree angle forward, if looking at the black line is 0 and straight at the wall in 90. 

**2) Dropping the Elbow in the Catch**

In freestyle as well as the other three competitive strokes, the entire forearm and hand must be used as a single unit to provide the most propulsion. Compare the surface area of just your hand, to the surface area of your hand + your forearm. Which do you think allows you to grab the most water and apply the most force? 

The key to using the entire forearm and hand as a paddle is to minimize wrist flexion and maintain a ""high elbow"" pull. A proper high elbow pull looks like this:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6qIhkuzTx0

Here, Grant Hackett, the greatest 1500m swimmer to ever live, demonstrates an EXCELLENT high elbow pull. Once his arm goes out front of his body, his elbow stays at the surface of the water while he lowers his forearm and hand into the water and anchors it in place. He then pulls his body past that anchored forearm and accelerates down the pool. Notice how this pull also ties in nicely with the rotation of the hips. When his arm is in the water anchored and pulling, that same side hip is rotating up as the arm pulls back. The pulling motion and hip rotation are inherently entangled. Hackett is always pulling with his forearm and hand leading the motion, he never drops his elbow or leads the pull with his elbow first. 

Maintaining a high elbow pull recruits more of the lats and upper back, and places less stress on the rotator cuff and deltoids. Many people who complain about chronic shoulder and biceps tendon problems would be well served by trying to keep their elbows high and using the larger muscles in the back. 

This video, teaching ""meat hook"" freestyle is an excellent in-depth look at a high elbow free:

In the video he also mentions sculling out and kind of waivering back and forth with the arm out front. This is just coasting and wasted effort that is delaying the pull. This is also a good time to bring up the good old ""S"" curve patterned freestyle. Years ago, it was believed the best way to pull in freestyle was to draw an S (or mirrored S) with the hand in the water. This is really not correct. The proper pull pulls down through the hips straight back. The body rotates with respect to the moving forearm/hand, which, if viewed from the frame of reference of stationary, non-rotating hips, it would look like an S pull. BUT YOUR HIPS ROTATE, so just pull straight back, keeping that elbow above the hand and wrist. 

**3) Breathing:**

The freestyle breath is often over looked. Lots of people think that you just turn your head, suck in air, and go. The fastest and most efficient freestyle breath is one that is well timed within the stroke. The proper freestyle breath also doesn't require too much leaning/laying on the non-breathing arm during the breath. If you're going to concentrate really hard about a high elbow pull and training this as a habit, make sure you aren't really laying on the elbow and pressing outward when you breath. Most often people really LAY on opposite arm when the breath, sort of pressing down and out with their arm as one fixed lever. This places lots of extra stress on shoulder and elbow. A high elbow pull is possible when breathing and not, it will just take some practice. 

Listen/watch this video about the breath: http://www.floswimming.org/coverage/234221-technique-tuesday/video/99220-the-freestyle-breath

Many people also like to LIFT their head out of the water to breath, when in fact you only need to rotate your head to the side, with one goggle still in the water and one out, to get all the air you need. The head can stay in line with the body, at that 30-45 degree angle forward, but just rotated to the side. The wake created by the head creates a pocket of low water behind it, allowing you to breath. 

Erik Vendt, one of the USA's greatest distance, 400IM, and generally tough event swimmers has a pretty good breath technique here: http://www2.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/Swimming+Olympic+Team+Trials+Day+8+0Eim5do-EGvl.jpg

**4) Hands**

I brought this up a little before, but I am going to touch (hah!) on a few more points about what to do with your hands during freestyle. Firstly, many people think you should squeeze your hands tight to make super taught paddles or almost cup your hands. Don't do this, this isn't necessary and will almost certainly lead to hand cramps. Instead let you hands relax. Don't spread your fingers out but don't smash them together either. 

When your hands are entering the water out front of you, they should be about shoulder width apart. Don't think about pin-point precision with the hand entry. Too often I see people really tense up their arms and hands trying to exactly place their hands in the right spot right out in front of them. Relax. Just extend your arm forward and let it drop. Re visit that first video I showed you. Watch Thorpe's arms out front. He just sort of lets them drop/glide into the water in front of him. The phase of freestyle where your arms are out of the water is call the recovery, let it be that. 

The other common thing is what was mentioned in the meat hook video. The tendency to have the hands kind of wander and wiggle around out front after they entry but before the catch. This only delays the catch and leads to gliding and coasting instead of constant propulsion down the pool. 


**5) Recovery Phase**

The recovery phase is the part of the stroke most people see from the deck and what many people base their opinions about ""smooth"" swimming on. 

The recovery phase should begin once the hand has reached the hip/waist area of the (maybe 3-4 inches below the hip bones). Once the hand has reached that level, it's travelled 98% of the distance it can in the pull. The recovery then starts with the ELBOW. The elbow is picked up out of the water with a relaxed hand/forearm and brought forward to begin the next cycle. Note there IS NO FLICKING OF THE WRIST OR HAND out the back of the stroke.

Watch this video of Phelps: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax77_hHq9Dc&t=1m15s

His elbows start the recovery and begin to come out of the water once his hands reach his suit/waist area. He isn't locking out his elbow to finish the pull and he isn't flicking his hands and wrist. He then extends and drops his wrists forward to start the entry and catch of the next cycle. Watch the video from the start to see him really put many of these points together well. 

One of the very common sightings recently has been the straight arm or windmill freestyle recovery. Unless you're an advanced competitive swimmer, I would stay away from this. Done improperly it can lead to shoulder injury and additional stress. 

**Conclusion**

I really hope this has all been informative and helpful. While it seems great to try and make all of these changes and tweaks all at once I strongly advise against it. Making stroke changes takes lots of time, and you can really only focus on one minor change at a time. Don't dive in to your next workout or practice and make wholesale changes. You'll end up spending too much time thinking and not enough time swimming. Pick one thing per practice to work on and do it well. 

Also, don't just think that drills and easy practices are the times you can work on your technique. Work on your technique ALL THE TIME. If you can't manage to do something right in the middle of a mainset, what makes you think you'll be able to do it right on race day? Every set is a great opportunity to work on something!",Swimming

I'm a former swimmer, I swam in high school as well as in college. I am now a high school swim coach and an assistant on a year round program. Going from high school to college I noticed huge improvements in my abilities in the pool after adding resistance training in the gym. I was able to drop significant time in most of my events by the end of each season even though I was putting in about half as many yards per night in the water. 

I consistently see posts on this subreddit looking for tips on how to drop time in the water. In my experience, resistance training is absolutely vital to improving the abilities of athletes across all disciplines. It doesn't matter if you're a distance swimmer or strictly a sprinter, everyone can benefit from introducing a new type of training stimulus. You want more explosiveness off the blocks? There are movements to help with that! Maybe you want to have an underwater dolphin kick like Caeleb Dressel? There are movements that can help you!

I know this community isn't always the most active especially when we aren't in an Olympic year but I still see posts from swimmers wanting to know how they can improve. If there is an audience out there that is interested in a series of posts detailing how to implement resistance training to achieve a certain goal in the pool, just let me know! 

I have a few ideas for the kinds of things that I can focus on but I would love to get some feedback. What kinds of areas are you all looking to improve on? Once I have a good sense for what the community wants, I can begin putting together information detailing how to safely and effectively use the weight room to gain an edge in the pool.

I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to about this because my mom doesn‚Äôt pay attention to my life and my dad and step mom aren‚Äôt swimmers.  Most of my friends don‚Äôt understand the sport.

So I started coaching the middle school swim team two weeks ago because 3 out of the 5 coaches didn‚Äôt have time.  My friend and I stepped up to the plate.  This is our first time teaching a new batch of swimmers.

The first days were bumpy because I didn‚Äôt understand what to do.  Few days, I adapted to the stressful situation watching 15 kids.  Also, I never realized how patient I can be. 

Well their first meet happened yesterday.  I was nervous they wouldn‚Äôt do as well as we expect because of my teaching.  That theory was thrown out the window quickly.  Nearly every all beginners perform far BEYOND any of our expectations! There were a few hiccups that we forgot to teach about (finishes, open flipturn, medley relays formation)

They won their first meet by 30 points Even my varsity swim coach congratulated my friend and I for teaching them so well. 

One of my kids blew my mind.  She swam a 35.8 on her 50 FREE!!! And this was her first time ever competing in swimming!

732,1639061815.0,My thoughts on the Lia Thomas situation as a trans NCAA swimmer,"Hello everyone, I just want to get my thoughts out there on the Lia Thomas situation. I am sure I‚Äôm going to be downvoted but I don‚Äôt care I want to speak my mind as a trans athlete. 

I have no problems with what she‚Äôs doing, she‚Äôs following the rules set forward by the Ncaa. If anyone is at fault here it‚Äôs the Ncaa and I do personally think that they should look at there rules in regards to trans athletes again. Though by the current rules set forward by the Ncaa she is following them and it‚Äôs simple as that. 

I know a bunch of you probably already saw her interview with SwimSwam and are aware that her voice is still rather deep. Well , she went through puberty before she transitioned, estrogen doesn‚Äôt just raise the voice, it takes years for that to happen. 

I would also like to bring a little personal experience to this topic. Realizing you‚Äôre trans is one of the hardest things a person can do, then add a sport into it and it makes the decision to come out and be who you are so much harder. I personally am a non binary swimmer on a D1 women‚Äôs team. Though coming out I was scared I was going to lose my swimming career because of who I am. For Lia coming out and living her life as who she is was one of the hardest things a person can do. It affects everything people start to hate you just for who you are . 

There have been other trans athletes who kicked ass in the pool and didn‚Äôt get the same back lash (especially G Ryan). And what I think we need to realize is Lia is talented when it comes to swimming even pre transition. She‚Äôs following the rules and regulations put in place by the Ncaa, she‚Äôs doing everything right in regards to following the rules. 

So I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is yes she‚Äôs winning by a ton right now but that‚Äôs not a fault on her that‚Äôs a fault on the Ncaa, and I feel like everyone should try and approach this situation with a little more compassion and understanding.",Swimming

743,1703209083.0,I almost drowned today (ocean) and got swept over rocks. I can't sleep,"Im in the southern hemisphere. It's currently 3am and I can't sleep. Have been getting nightmares and my legs hurt so much.

I (27F) can swim, but I'm not a very strong swimmer. I'm light in general and am very buoyant so swimming, especially in the ocean, can be quite exhausting. 

I'm om vacation with my LDR boyfriend, and we went to some tidal pools with his friends. Ocean looked angry but at a certain area it looked okay. We went in once, was fun. Current was fun.

Went in again and suddenly the current got really strong. I got swept away. There's safety ropes across the tidal pools that you can hang on to.

I grabbed one. I was okay for a few minutes but then the current got even stronger. I held on to the rope and suddenly i was under the water. I couldn't get my head up. It's like something was holding me down.

The current was so strong it ripped my hand off of the rope. I tried signaling with the other hand but I was too deep under.

 I kept waiting for my body to bob back to the surface but that didn't happen. I felt an urge to gulp for air. I couldn't. Felt like hours. Then i saw these faint stars like you do when you get up too quickly. 

I was thinking of my family and my bf thinking ""is this how I'm going to die?"" My eldest brother passed away when I was in third grade and I remember my mom, how much she suffered. I felt guilty for putting her through all that again.

My lungs started burning more and I exhaled thinking that was my last exhale. 

Next moment I was pulled out of the current onto the rocks. I just started crying and feeling my bf hug me. I was shaking so so bad.

After I calmed down, I thought ""Jeez that was close, but luckily Im okay"".

I wasn't injured and didn't wanna ruin the day. So I went over to my BFs group of friends and sat on the rocks. They were chatting away but I was zoning out trying to get a grip of my emotions. 

Then suddenly the tide came back up again.

First wave and water splashed in my face.

I panicked. I stood up wanting to go higher.

Second wave came in while I was halfway up and swept my feet from under me.

I grabbed onto whatever and luckily stayed on the rocks. I screamed out for help, but I knew it was pointless because I was between the rocks. The tide was angry and no one could practically help me.

But suddenly my bf was there and he told me to hold on to him. I clung to him but looked over his shoulder to see a third, much larger wave coming towards us. We were already knee deep in water and he told me to hold on tight. My body got tense and my eyes teared up.

Im really going to die here is what I thought. 

When the wave it us it was an immense force. I clung to him but couldn't hold on. Suddenly the water swept me away from him, sending me crashing into the rocks. It was chaos. Didn't know if I should kick or grab. My head was spinning and under water again. 

I didn't want to think of my family and my boyfriend again. It was too painful. I just wanted everything to end.

I don't know how but my bfs friends got me out and pulled me to higher ground. I looked down at my bf at the mercy of the ocean and called for him.

He was okay. Shaken with a few scratches. When I looked down at my leg I realized I was cut open everywhere. My left foot was entirely covered in blood. But it didn't hurt, I guess it was adrenaline. 

We climbed over the boulders and went home.

I cleaned myself up. Wounds are all superficial. So I should be fine. 

But I'm clearly not. I ugly cried in my BFs arms today. And now its 3.30 am and I can't sleep cuz everytime I close my eyes I feel like Im suffocating. My legs also hurt, a lot. Feels like I've run a marathon. If nightmares won't wake me, the pain wakes me.  

Sorry for the long post. I just really wanted to get this off my chest. My bf is sleeping and he's done so so much for me already. I feel so weak for having to rant to internet strangers but maybe this will help me sleep. 

If you have loved ones tell them you love them. Every day we're at the mercy of mother nature and we never know when she'll take us.

Bf feels guilty cuz he asked me to go to the tidal pools. It's not his fault. Im an adult and got myself in this situation. Because I was reckless my family almost lost another child, a daughter, a sister.

749,1565987467.0,Just swam my first mile,"I started basically from scratch. It's been a long, frustrating 8 months. 4 months in, after focusing on improving my technique, I felt like I was worse off than when I got in the pool. I'm about to turn 40, so neither fitness nor new learning comes at the speed it used to. The upside is I feel more patient with myself, and I'm far better about being terrible at things, so I just kept at it. 

I came to this sub for advice or just to read about strokes. I watched the videos you guys posted and tried the exercises. 

The days I didn't feel like swimming, I made myself go to the pool anyway, and just did 6 or 7 laps and called it a day. But I was also feeling more comfortable in the water and less like I was being waterboarded. I finally timed myself for an all-out 50 and I was down to like 42 seconds. That may not sound like something to write home about, but when I started I was a couple of seconds over a minute.  My body started changing too. I had less back pain and I noticed my arms are thicker. I feel more taut. 

Today I just got in the pool and tried not to think about anything but my 32 laps. I let my technique go wherever and tried to let the splash, splash, splash, breath become a kind of background music. 

And then I was done. My 8-month goal over. Feels great! Tomorrow I relax and Sunday I get back in the pool. Thank you all for the advice and the community :)",Swimming

752,1605367621.0,A tongue-in-cheek zoological classification of certain fascinating species we can find in swimming pools...,"It has been many years since last studied any Latin, but a tongue-in-cheek (and most certainly far from absolutely correct Latin) classification of certain strange species one can find in swimming pools... during open/public and lane swimming sessions.

The list is probably far from complete...

&#x200B;

*Firmum Seminiverbius*  (stable talker)

Members of this species can be found standing at the shallow end(s), deeply immersed in lengthy chats with other members of the same species. In both public and lane swimming sessions, they give murderous looks to swimmers whilst making it impossible for them to do turns of any kind. Theories abound on whether they are merely attracted to the humid environment, the chemicals in the water, or they are just passive aggressive species who keep energy expenditure to a minimum - most of the latter being taken up by the constant vocal output.

&#x200B;

*Ignarus Faustum* (ignorant bliss)

Members of this species exhibit, from anthropocentric viewpoint, a facial expression of a deep state of bliss - whilst they are doing very slow breaststroke, or some imitation of it, in the fast lanes during lane swimming sessions.No matter how many swimmers overtake them and how many times, they always continue their activity with an unchanged blissful expression on their faces. This usually happens in pools supervised by another species, the Altum Inanis Oculi, which chooses not to notice the chaos ensuing in those lanes.

&#x200B;

*Inscitus Inscius*  (stupid ignorant)

They are an elusive species, but they can be seen during very busy public swim sessions in smaller pools. They choose to swim backstroke in the middle, never at the edges, of the busy pool.In order to produce maximum possible chaos, even in pools that have straight parallel lines or structures visible on the ceiling that they could use as reference, they perform backstroke either with a random wavy trajectory or at a random angle.The expression on their faces, when collisions occur, is something that is still being attempted to be classified by behavioural experts. One key trait is clear, though: members of these species, when accidentally hit, are the first to complain to representatives of the *Altum Inanis Oculi* species.

&#x200B;

*Centro Universum* (centre of the universe)

Members of this species are a fascinating sight for both cognitive and behavioural scientists. They can be swimming breaststroke, with their head above the water, both eyes facing forward - but, in public swimming sessions, they can still swim in random directions and cross the path of freestyle swimmers, who are approaching in a perfectly straight line for the Nth time, perfectly above the same clear lane marking.They can be observed even jumping in front of such swimmers. If any collisions occur, they are the first to run to members of the species *Altum Inanis Oculi* in order to complain.Scientists are still debating whether the behaviour is due to some egocentric trait or terminal stupidity - or an unbalanced combination of both.

&#x200B;

*Superbus Immobilis* (proud unmovable)

Close relative of the species *Firmum Seminiverbius*. Some evolutionary theories postulate that they are essentially the same species, but this particular one optimised out the energy spent on vocal output.Their behaviour is exactly the same, with the one key difference of blocking the ends of the lanes without chatting. Some sightings have been reported of them moving occasionally, but vast amounts of time are spent in immobile clusters at the shallow end(s) of the pool.It remains a mystery for the zoologists whether this species has visual sensing abilities and higher brain functions completely deactivated by water - but their behaviour suggests that this may be a valid hypothesis.

&#x200B;

*Respersio Magnificus* (magnificent splasher)

Members of this species are fascinating to observe. The amount of water that they can dislocate and splash at others, together with the radius of splashing, is inversely proportional with the speed that they propel themselves with on the surface of the pool.The most quasi-stationary representatives of this species can produce magnificent waves and artesian fountain-like eruptions of water in whichever part of the pool they are attempting movement in. One of the most fascinating aspects is that, in a still inexplicable manner, they never appear in the vicinity of members of the *Protector Capillitae* species.

&#x200B;

*Altum Inanis Oculi* (high-positioned blind eyes)

A rather authoritative and imposing species. Not to be confused with the highly competent variants, who have learnt that watching the pool from a high chair means not just watching out for swimmers to save from danger, but also the enforcement of common sense in the pool.Members of this species have all the behavioural traits and appearance of the commendable and competent variants, but they completely lack any common sense and observational skills. Even if some exceptionally brainless species' representatives are jumping on swimmers, or members of *Inscitus Inscius* cause chaos and multiple collisions, the most representative members of *Altum Inanis Oculi* remain completely oblivious to the impossibly rude or even downright dangerous situations caused in the pool.

&#x200B;

*Contrarium Directio* (opposite direction)

A species that, according to some debatable neurophysiological theories, has its visual cortex wired such that it inverts the spatial information provided by their eyes.Members of this species are known to swim in the exact opposite direction compared to any number of signs that point out the clockwise or counter-clockwise swimming direction for the respective lane.The presence of human swimmers in any number, who are all swimming in the right direction, does not affect this species' behavior at all - and gets visibly irate when several swimmers try to avoid collision with them.

&#x200B;

*Confusus Calcitro* (chaotic kicker)

Members of this species are among the more mobile aquatic organisms, however they propel themselves in a highly chaotic manner. Even in the case of freestyle swimming, they are known to be able to wobble so much at such random angles, that they kick others in nearby lanes. Even a double lane is often insufficient to accommodate their style of movement, and in single lanes nobody can escape being kicked or hit by their various limbs. Invariably, they have the impression, and they often convey this to others, that others should be more mindful.

&#x200B;

*Protector Capillitiae* (hairdo protector)

Members of this species are highly economical. They avoid purchasing waterproof hair protection equipment.However, since they have spent many orders of magnitude more on the coiffure that identifies members of this species even when viewed from a great distance, they become extremely irritated and vocal if other swimmers produce any waves or make any droplets of water fly in the direction of their precious hairdo.

&#x200B;

*Tardissimus Celer* (slowest speedy)

They are harder to recognise on land, due to the vast amount of extremely varied accessories that alter their appearance. Low-profile swimming goggles, the most technologically advanced hydrodynamic textiles, several hydration bottles with different liquids of different colours, countless paddles and kickboards are accompanying members of this species. Once they find themselves in the water, their speed and high-intensity workout-oriented accessories are reduced to decorative items, and, due to their intolerably slow speed, very long breaks, and spectacular splashing in every direction, they can be mistaken for a cross between the species *Superbus Immobilis* and *Respersio Magnificus*.

&#x200B;

Inscribitur Parente (entitled parent)

It is a rather generic term for a not yet fully defined species. Difficulty in classification arises from the fact that they can overlap with many species listed above, and some scientists assert that it is a merely behavioural label.  The key trait of members of this species is that their offspring can unleash any cataclismic inferno in the pool, but they will still vehemently jump to the offspring's defense. One charactertistic manifestation is, for example, offspring almost breaking spinal columns of human swimmers by jumping on them at random and unpredictable manner - but *Inscribitur Parente* will justify this by, for example, stating that it is the offspring's birthday on that day.

Was going in for surgery in March but then COVID hit the fan and I decided to postpone the surgery.

With no swimming throughout the quarantine my shoulder got worse.  Our pool finally opened back up and I went out to gauge things, and there was just nothing left there.  It's so loose now on the recovery I won't risk the motion.

I had joked about it but it really was a crappy feeling being in a pool and actually not being able to swim.  Kinda a first for me.  Looks like I'll get the surgery this summer as things are getting back to normal now.  

Wish me luck.

So I wanted to write up a little post about some of the types of unique people I run into at the pool:

**The Grandpa/Grandma Types:**  some of my favorite lane partners, they are encouraging and kind.  I've had them say things to me like, ""I like swimming with you because you swim just a little faster than me and it makes me swim faster"" and ""Aren't we all just here to have fun and exercise?""

**The Former Swim Team Types:**  These men and women are graceful to watch and execute beautiful flip turns, but they can sometimes make you feel as if you're basically standing still in the water.

**The Swim Toy and Tech Types:**  These guys have all the latest gadgets, be it watches, phone apps, paddles, kickboards, bouys, etc.  They time themselves on laps, do a million different toys, and are fun to watch because you never know what they're going to do next.

**The Social Butterfly Types:**  When I see one of these guys in the pool I know it's going to be a good swim - they are friendly and catch me up on the latest gossip.  They learn everyone's names, help arrange people in a crowded pool, and are generally just fun to be around.

**The Busy Types:**  Lured to the gym by the daycare, they enjoy this little oasis of meditative space in their day.  They just want the quiet and rhythm of the laps and they tend to swim for a long time.  This is me, even after my kids outgrew the daycare.

**The Beginners:**  We've all been there, and we want to support you.  Ask if you need anything.  You've got this!

**The Inconsiderate:**  The lane hogs, the people who massively splash those doing backstroke, those that get in in street clothes and full makeup to wander around and interrupt lap swimmers, those that flipturn with such a violent movement they splash the hot tub and threaten their lane partner, are grouchy if asked to accommodate another person, or a million other annoying things.  Sigh.

789,1542018422.0,I shaved 10 seconds off my freestyle time in less than a week by fixing some poor technique issues. Here are some exercises I found helpful!,"Last week I made a very vague post asking for pointers on my freestyle technique. My 50m freestyle sprint time averaged 59 seconds, and didn't improve over my first three weeks of swimming. I found it frustrating because my relaxed breaststroke time was only 50 seconds.

&#x200B;

So over the weekend I had a session with a coach, and while my technique was overall pretty smooth there was no power in my pull. We identified three main problems and she gave me some drills to correct them. I timed my 50m sprint today (after 1500m of laps and drills) and it was only 49 seconds! I'm excited to try again when I'm not exhausted. So here are my problems and solutions.

&#x200B;

*Note: I'm not claiming your speed will necessarily increase dramatically if you do these. But if you're new to swimming or getting back in the water after a hiatus (like me - 12 years off) then maybe these will help you fix some technique issues! I found searching past* /r/swimming *posts really helpful so want to give something back to the community.*

&#x200B;

**ISSUE #1: No strength in pull/exit**

All my strength was concentrated in the first half of my pull, and my arm just kind of rose to the surface in the second half. Here's an illustration of what I was doing. 

[Flailing noodle arm](https://preview.redd.it/sxepv9a2dvx11.png?width=819&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd5b42c43cb22ac9534fa75c2efc9c5a2aee44f4)

&#x200B;

**DRILL: One-armed freestyle with pull buoy** 

Keep your legs straight and still, arms in streamline position, core engaged. Stroke using only one arm, concentrating on three main things:

 \- feeling the ""pulling"" sensation the whole time your arm is underwater. I found it really helpful to pretend I was splashing the person behind me during the exit, without breaking form (note: don't actually do this if there is someone behind you). Having a huge splash at the end isn't good technique, but in a drill it made me get familiar with the sensation of using force all the way to the end.

\- reaching forward as far as you can during catch (see issue 3)

\- elbows high in recovery (try trailing the tip of your pointer finger through the water if you struggle with this)

I do 50m each arm, then 100m with four stokes on each side (1-2-3-breathe-swap sides) - but adjust to whatever suits you! This drill is pretty agonising... so if 25m each way is all you can manage at the start then start there.

&#x200B;

**ISSUE #2: Dragging backside**

My bottom and legs were a little bit underwater - not dramatically, but enough to affect speed. Coach said this was because I was looking slightly ahead instead of straight down, which threw my body out of balance.

**DRILL: Streamline kick with arms**

You could even just do laps of slow freestyle but making a mental note to focus on your head position. Just practice looking straight down and feeling the sensation of your heels and bum touching the top of the water. If you feel yourself drag, bring your focus back to your head position. When breathing, try and keep your head + neck in a straight line. Turn only to breathe - don't start moving your head pre-emptively like I was.

&#x200B;

**ISSUE #3: No reach**

Pretty self explanatory. During catch I was just kind of reaching forward and putting my hand in the water, instead of really rotating and reaching as far as possible. My torso was a bit like a flat plank of wood with paddles. I found this really hard to correct in water... but am slowly getting better!

&#x200B;

**EXERCISE: Practice reaching on land**

Stand in front of mirror looking straight ahead. Reach your arms up above your head and rest your hands - as if you're in the streamline position. Then just practice rotating your torso so that your sides alternate facing the mirror, and stretching the arm closest the mirror as high as possible. Try and touch the roof! Your other arm can bend slightly - or you can pretend to do a stroke. Things to focus on:

\- Reach with your shoulderblades as well as your arm. Feel the sensation of your shoulder blade moving up and down your back.  If you struggle to feel this... try reaching forward by ""shrugging"" and slowly moving your shoulderblades first, then stretch with your whole arm. This will help engage your back muscles when you pull.

\- Look straight ahead while rotating. This is why doing in front of a mirror helps! Your face should move as little as possible. Pretend there's a string connected to the top of your head, pulling you straight towards the ceiling.

\- Keep your core engaged throughout, and try and feel a bit of a stretch in your sides when reaching.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And there you go! Doing these exercises and focusing on these issues in isolation really really helped me pull it all together when doing the stroke. I haven't been swimming for long, but the time improvement is really exciting. Hope this post helps someone else with similar issues!",Swimming

But today I swam a little warm-up then started an interval which I intended to be 500m, but I felt really good so I went for 1000m.

824,1602217251.0,Does anyone else believe that breaststroke is the hardest stroke?,"So I know it's redundant to ask which stroke is the hardest, but I believe breaststroke is the most challenging stroke. Most people who are good at breaststroke are just natural breaststrokers. You can tell very early on who will be a breaststroker. They have exceptional ankle and knee flexibility.

&#x200B;

Of course, like any other stroke, you can work hard and be just as good as someone who is a natural, but it's so much harder to be good at than any other stroke. I think it's easier to become a good butterflier than breaststroker. The kick is different. It's the most inefficient stroke, and the pull-out is very delicate and precise. 

&#x200B;

I was a butterflier and breaststroker. Whenever I did IM (my favorite event), I felt good until I did breaststroke. It felt like it took twice as much work to do it, and I don't think it's because I was tired. I have done IM and replaced breaststroke with fly, and it felt so much easier. I also found the 200 fly to be a million times easier than the 200 breaststroke. And this is coming from someone who did breaststroke events more than freestyle or back. Sprinting breaststroke is just so painful. You're going up and down up down up down.

&#x200B;

Anyone else agree or disagree? If you're fast at breaststroke, you have my utmost respect! Please be nice. It's just my opinion. I understand every event/stroke is hard if you put the effort.",Swimming

I have recently started swimming again, mainly in the evenings but now due to work I try and swim during the day.

It wasn‚Äôt a MASSIVE problem before and I have only ever got frustrated a couple of times. 

But today I got so frustrated I had to leave the pool completely and went for a run. 

So because I have switched to day time swimming there are a lot more mums (like me) but I would call them the ‚Äòsocial swimmers‚Äô; mainly swimming in breast stroke two abreast having conversations with their heads completely out of the water practically ‚Äúswimming‚Äù vertically. A few are the older ladies but ya know if you‚Äôre slow, you are slow and I will wait a reasonable distance till I set off from the side of the pool. 

Then there are the REALLY fast swimmers. Mainly men and a couple of very athletic ladies. However due to their only being three lanes (two fast and one slow) the majority of people are in the slow lane so today I was swimming in a slow lane with about 9 people. 

My question is: as I am still relatively slow (not slow slow) and I am swimming for fitness and training should I try and get into the fast lane? Or should I just go back to trying to swim in the evenings when pools are quieter? 

I‚Äôm really struggling because I‚Äôm so ‚Äúinbetween‚Äù the paces. I‚Äôm not slow and I‚Äôm not as fast as others. 
Is it worth pushing myself to my limits just so I don‚Äôt frustrate slower and faster swimmers by being in the wrong lanes?",Swimming

884,1589774191.0,How kids learn to jump from a huge platform into the water? (Diving secrets),"Hi everyone, many people saw Olympic diving like that but do you know what it takes a kid to know the right technique? (If you prefer a belly flop this may be also interesting)

I've spent many years in diving so here is the story... 

[Swan dive](https://preview.redd.it/qi1pvjgihbz41.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8f91f712dfd931a8a8cc15baad3716e02266cfb)

First of all kids come to the 'dry land' to warm up.

&#x200B;

[Ready for the pain :\) \(joke but this can happen\)](https://preview.redd.it/f30xuz80ibz41.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=14e62baea2a76d35eb3abde7d286a3455880f1bf)

After that sportsmen can jump into a foam pit from a springboard instead of water. The reason for that is simple: a belly flop into a foam pit is not painful but even 1 meter height into the water can be enough to make a kid so sad.

&#x200B;

[By the way this board costs about 4000$ \(without a stand\)](https://preview.redd.it/2ue6frusibz41.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=a220e3c6318ef8378243aaba8ac80b005fbc7eaa)

Tumbling track is also a very important part of the life of younger divers. During the first years of training they spend even more time making simple gymnastics instead of diving into a swimming pool. That is important both for muscles and technique.

You can see a coach there holding a rope - this construction is called a spotting belt or just a belt. So even a kid can try something hard even on a floor.

&#x200B;

[Don't be scared about your head](https://preview.redd.it/3pek3jumzbz41.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=f422b8016409a2c183f664fcde7c58696b869815)

And here is the twisting belt. A coach can hold you while rotating in 2 axes: flips and twists. Btw flips are usually called somersaults but it is a different story. Write in comments if you would like to know more about different types of dives.

&#x200B;

[This twisting belt could have probably saved many daredevils :\)](https://preview.redd.it/kgmxbmex0cz41.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=834b27353043ef7c1f201963b8d134fb4ca1d5ac)

Many people think that a diving board (or springboard) is made of plastic. No. Modern springboards for competitions are made out of an aircraft-grade aluminum. The end of the board has a scratchy slip-resistant surface because it is really painful to fall :)

&#x200B;

[My coach called this 'iron lady'...](https://preview.redd.it/9b0vpgf2yfz41.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c8297d7068b0d1c21f67131b70cc14dbb7bd6e8)

Trampoline is also widely used for a range of activities: flips, twists and a lot of fun :) With the help of the belt we can do even head-first dives. It is important because humans are actually not used to jump on their heads after many flips so that's why it is much easier to start it here before making a painful splash in a swimming pool.

&#x200B;

[Don't worry, the coach is responsible!](https://preview.redd.it/xea2inxzyfz41.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4d7deaa616985d313eae37b30b336f8aed3fa21)

After all kids finally go to swimming pool but during first several months they don't go to the higher boards. There are a lot of specific exercises from the starting block. Here also truck tire tubes are widely used for first dives (write below if you would like to see this).

&#x200B;

[I hope you can swim well ;\)](https://preview.redd.it/jnqnat4f2gz41.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d3a69056fcc2ecc9e333e7da6d213d2934b78b4)

We are frequently asked about swimming: is it obligatory for a kid to be able to swim before swimming pool. You can be shocked but not. But the coaches are not monsters so there a belt with floats can help for those who can't swim and after some trainings floats are little be little removed.

&#x200B;

[Sorry, I can't swim :\)](https://preview.redd.it/a5vug6kj3gz41.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8a280f195d1f52bb3422a71b7d73c6d24592b36)

And only several months after basic trainings the kids are allowed to visit bigger platforms. Max is 10 meters. In Olympic-type swimming pool you can find 1 and 3 meters boards & 3 - 5 - 7,5 - 10 meters platforms (not flexible).

Some people know high diving with 20 and 27 meter platforms but it is a different story.

&#x200B;

[Diving platforms are really huge.](https://preview.redd.it/2flc946c4gz41.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bf0922121a5d01f9b1a966f7c74bcc2fff10a8f)

Modern swimming pools are equipped with bubbler machine to make a huge 'hydromassage' to prevent a pain from a smack.

[Bubbler](https://preview.redd.it/8m24p74s4gz41.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f599ab5a6c655bba2ae131e9fbcf6c5298a1bb3)

893,1589738373.0,Just a heads up: The current economic situation will be used to cut swimming programs.,"So, this is now my 27th year being involved with competitive swimming at the high school and collegiate level.  And one thing that is constant, outside of the smell of chlorine, and coaches trying to prevent swimmer's ear and shoulder injuries, is that whenever there is an economic downturn, it will be used to eliminate swim programs.

In 2002 the swim program where I went to high school was cut.  In 2010, the swim program where I currently coach was nearly cut.  We expect some deep cuts next year, or elimination of the program all together.

The reason I'm writing this is not to make you sad, but to make you aware.  Keep an close eye on your school board (or board of regents), your athletic director, and your administration.  Be prepared to react to budget cuts.  Have your parents/community/alumni connected, and ready to mobilize.

I remember one of the prelims sessions, they were swimming the women's 100 free, and they were on like heat 1 or heat 2, basically still running the swimmers who had just barely squeaked under the QT.

Anyway, one of the girls walks out, and she's just tiny.  Like a full head shorter than any of the other swimmers.  I look down at the heat sheet, wondering how old she is.  And her age says ""13.""  I nudged my dad and showed him, and we were both like ""Dang!""  

So the heat goes in the water, and the 13 year old drops almost a full second from her seed time and just smashes everyone else in the heat.  She wasn't quite fast enough to qualify for semis, but she wasn't that far off, either.  

Dad and I are just kind of looking at each other with eyebrows raised, and he was like, ""Yeah, we're gonna see that girl in another 4 years.  What's her name?""

I skimmed back down the heat sheet and read, ""Uh...looks like she's...Melissa...Franklin.""  

So yeah.  Good call, Dad.  We definitely saw her again in 4 years.",Swimming

908,1564279529.0,Today I swore I wouldn't get in the pool.,"I'm morbidly obese and recently decided to include swimming as apart of my exercise regimen. I figured since I've always loved the water, it would be a natural fit. I have a lot of form issues to work out, having never took lessons as a child past the basic jumping in, floating, blowing bubbles, doggy paddling, etc. I've always feel incredibly refreshed after a session in the pool, especially due to the fact that it's 110 degrees out. 

 I haven't been able to get in the pool in about a month (tisk tisk, I know), and I was feeling rather frustrated- like I'd never be able to get down breathing to the side while simultaneously looking down at the water while also remembering to keep my elbows at an angle. I told myself I'd be back today. And I wasn't feeling it at all. After laying on my bed for an hour, screwing around on Reddit, debating on whether or not I should go, I crawled into my car and made the trek over. In the process, I ended up forgetting my flip flops at home (and had to turn around to get them. Luckily, wasn't too far away), and got my bag stuck in my locker before I went into the pool (and ended up having to get my lock cut off lmao), but after this mess, I figured I'd driven thirty minutes across town to our beautiful campus pool and I simply wasn't going to turn around and give up at the last minute. So, I finally made it in the water despite really not wanting to. Even better, there was someone in the only shallow lane that I usually like to swim in. I ended up swimming in the shallow area alongside that lane, and had the ***best swim I've had so far*** according to my Apple Watch. I swam 125 yards farther than my previous swim, in the same amount of time as well as burned 150+ calories more! While this may not be a huge accomplishment, I'm personally proud of it. Somehow, I managed to remember to incorporate all of the various things that I've heard so far on YouTube while trying to ""self-coach"" myself for the time being. I even started to feel the burn in my arms a little! I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but I'll take it! Anyways, I'm home now feeling very refreshed, tired, and a little hungry. I'm off to have dinner with my wonderful father, grateful to go to a school with access to an amazing pool, and to live in a time with such amazing, free educational resources out there such as YouTube.

We're sure you all know about the controversy surrounding reddit and third party app API charging. But if you want a synopsis, [the Explain Like I'm Five pinned post](https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/142kct8/eli5_why_are_subreddits_going_dark/) is complete. The [AskHistorians pinned post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/) is very good at explaining context for long term redditors and moderators.

Swimmit will be participating in the protest starting on 12-Jun-2023. The mod team has been here for well over a decade, right since the start of the sub. We are a small sub in reddit‚Äôs world. 

Unlike many general subs the mod team are swimmers, experienced and knowledgeable in various aspects of one of the world‚Äôs most popular (and as we know, difficult) participation activities. 

Since day one r/swimming has always fostered and encouraged an inclusive ethos. We have not previously participated in reddit-wide actions.

Reddit‚Äôs proposed changes to third-party app charging will likely make those apps untenable, according to the app developers. 

* Loss of third-party apps will make reddit a less-inclusive place for users. 
* Loss of third party apps will make modding more difficult.

The mod team moderate because it‚Äôs a sport we love, are active in and we want to foster the sense of community common in swimmers around the world and we all feel a sense of stewardship toward the sub. 

We don‚Äôt know where this protest will lead or if or how it will be resolved or how long it will last. We have no direct line to the Admins, no communication, and like most average subs, no acknowledgement from reddit ever of the sub. 

We're all just swimming here. And we know sometimes you just have to jump in the water.",Swimming

I hated having to go to meets and being on the outside lanes and the last one to finish, and remember asking if I could just go to practice but not meets (not allowed, so I ended up quitting). I had a great swim coach though, and when I was in college I discovered the gigantic campus pools at my large university and the free lap swim hours, and started again. I was struggling with awful panic attacks and social anxiety, and learned in a psychology class that exercise is ‚Äúnature‚Äôs Prozac‚Äù- I was terrified to go to the crowded campus gyms, but the pool felt safe, you don‚Äôt have to hide from stranger eye contact  when you‚Äôre under water!

It was a ‚Äúmiracle cure‚Äù for my anxiety and for the first time in my life I started to learn to talk to people I didn‚Äôt know without freezing up. The panic attacks vanished. I was in terrific shape and got really good- I kept pushing myself and just kept working on distance freestyle. My back, arms and legs got super toned and muscular (I wasn‚Äôt remotely athletic as a shy gawky kid and weird goth teen!)

After I graduated from college in 2009 I struggled to find full time work with a useless humanities degree. For a long time I could only find part-time jobs. The upside of this was I had plenty of time to swim. I was lucky to get a job working for a corporate fitness center with a pool, and then a nonprofit organization under the YMCA, so I could swim at that Y for free. I was VERY addicted to the calm feeling I could only get from swimming- if I was traveling and couldn‚Äôt access a pool for a week or two, I‚Äôd basically go into withdrawal.

When I went back to school for my Master‚Äôs I swam at the campus pool, but I started running out of free time. My final semester I was working full time and doing 20 hours a week at my internship site (my program, for Mental Health Counseling, required a 700 hour field experience/internship to graduate). For the first time in ten years I just...stopped swimming.

And it‚Äôs been three years now, and I just never got back into it. I‚Äôve been working full time with hour commutes at really stressful jobs dealing with people in crisis. I got married a month after I graduated from my Master‚Äôs degree program. Before the pandemic I would stop by the gym after work and run on the treadmill or the arc trainer for half an hour, but I‚Äôm trying to be a good citizen and not spread Covid around at gyms. 

I thought about going back to swimming before the pandemic but kept balking. For one thing, I didn‚Äôt even like spending half an hour at the gym when I knew I had to get home, shower, make dinner, and enjoy my precious remaining three hours to relax before going to bed.

For another, I‚Äôm sure everyone here knows how much it sucks to try to start swimming again after a break. With ‚Äúleg based ‚Äú exercise like jogging, you still have plenty of leg muscles because you need your legs to walk around on all day. With swimming freestyle, those arm muscles feel nonexistent if you haven‚Äôt been using them for swimming.

I still have dreams about swimming all the time. I do miss it. I feel like I betrayed something, like I abandoned a friend who was always there for me. I know that probably sounds silly, but swimming basically saved my life. I want to go back to it, but I don‚Äôt know about spending over an hour with the showering, changing, swimming, showering again, drying hair routine when I just want to go home after a long day at work.

I lived in Hawaii for years and spent tons of time in the water there.

BUT I never learned how to swim freestyle. 

I started swimming in my gym pool recently in pursuit of a Sprint Triathlon. I want to learn to swim efficiently.

It's taken awhile and I felt a bit overwhelmed in the pool trying to figure out Freestyle. I could barely make one 25 yard pool length without choking. 

Yesterday,  I was finally able to swim 50 yards...there and back. I was happy as a kid in a candy store! 

The interesting thing is  that I was very tired from the other training I did yesterday and when I got in the pool I told myself I'll just swim slowly. I wasn't really focused. I slowed way down and I think that relaxed me in the water.  I wasn't over thinking everything.

965,1613742855.0,Trick for neutralizing chlorine after swimming,"To neutralize the chlorine in my hair/skin after swimming, I follow these steps:

1. Get a bottle of [chewable vitamin C tablets](https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-chewable-vitamin-c-500-mg.,-500-tablets.product.100369190.html).

2. Get an empty bottle to carry in your gym bag.  Personally I like the glass bottles that come with [Asian sauces](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015XMIGU/).

Before you swim, fill the bottle with ~6 ounces of water and drop in a vitamin C tablet (bite the tablet into pieces to help it dissolve quicker).  After your swim and before you start the shower, pour the solution into your hair and wipe some over over your skin.  Go ahead and start your shower, but rinse your hair last.

This dramatically lowers the chlorine residue.  If I forget to bring the solution to the gym in the morning, then I can smell the chlorine the instant I step into the shower that evening.

Note that sodium ascorbate has a very short shelf life in water, but vitamin C tablets also contain ascorbic acid which acts as a preservative.  This is [similar to Swimspray](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9301909B2/en), but is more economical and more readily available.  Vitamin C tablets cost 3-cents apiece and are sold everywhere.",Swimming
966,1597242641.0,I did it ! I achieved my swimming goal thanks to this sub !,"Hello fellow swimmers,

I am a 31M, average fitness and started freestyle earlier this year. My condo has a 30m pool and I set goal for myself at the beginning of the year to be able to swim 10 rounds without break. At the beginning I was barely able to do 1 without panting for breath.

And today....I did 20 laps !!! Obviously my pace and techniques are still terrible but I'm feeling ecstatic to have come so far !!! Some of the advice I took from this sub helps me a ton :

\- I reached and extended more with each stroke.

\- I rotated my hip instead of shoulder to breath.

\- I used to overkick a lot, this time I was more mindful of my kicking and tried to kick with a more even pace.

\- I took more time to warm up.

I also realized  around 6-8 laps are the most difficult part, stamina wise. After that it just somehow became very easy. 

So what would you guys suggest for  the next steps to train ?  Do I train for more speed or more distance ? What are the realistic goals for someone my age ?

981,1653065602.0,Breaststroke Technique: What the elite are saying (‚ÄòInside with Brett Hawke‚Äô compilation),"As a breaststroker, one of my favorite podcasts I‚Äôve been listening to is that of former Auburn Head coach and Olympian, Brett Hawke (‚ÄòInside with Brett Hawke‚Äô available on Youtube and Spotify). Self-proclaimed as ‚Äúknowing nothing about breaststroke,‚Äù Brett makes it a point to ask most elite Breaststrokers (or their coaches) about their technique and what makes them successful in his interviews. Here is a compilation of their responses:

**Josh Prenot**

TIMING

-Breaststroke has lots of resistance, goal is to keep out of the resistance phase

-Pull with your legs in a streamline; Kick with your arms and torso in a streamline

-Emphasis on drills: Underwater breaststroke, Double kick Breaststroke (Likes how Van Der Burgh practices in a Kick-Pull-Kick cycle instead of Pull-Kick-Kick)

CATCH

-Catch is like a butterfly pull: elbows high fingertips down

-Elbows are wider than shoulders

-‚ÄúSweeping‚Äù motion in traditional coaching simply refers to transitioning fast from the catch-phase into the shoot phase

-Head position should be slightly forward

-Catch as far forward as possible, then slide the hips as far forward as possible before setting up kick (where many breaststrokers attain their ‚Äúheight‚Äù)

KICK

-Feet are turned out when they come up, some breaststrokers, like Amanda Beard, try to turn them in briefly when they come up and then turn them out as they initiate the propulsive phase

-Two ways for kicking: Attaining max range of motion (Chupkov) versus shortening to increase tempo (Peaty). Peaty can get away with shortening range of motion because his feet get a good catch (In Peaty‚Äôs interview he clarifies that he does, in fact, get the full range of motion. However, he does it extremely fast)

-Wide kick vs narrow kick: Both ways have been observed. Power vs pushing against more resistance. Time 25‚Äôs of both to test what works better for you

-Heel speed: Want to spend the least time you can bringing your legs up so you can get into your propulsive phase and into a streamline

-The dolphin upkick at the end: The breaststroke kick naturally goes down which allows you to pull some water with the bottom of your feet at the end. Don‚Äôt kick your legs back down otherwise that‚Äôs doing a dolphin kick and is cheating. Best way to execute this is to not put effort into your hamstrings but to rather tilt your chest and let your legs rise naturally

-Hips should always stay skimming at the surface 

DEVIATIONS 

-Many different ways to swim the stroke, most individualized between swimmers

-Commonalities: Fast arm recovery and timing are the constants among the best

**Adam Peaty**

-Main principle: Keep it narrow, keep it fluid

-Emphasis on pressing your arms and whipping it back when you can‚Äôt press anymore

-Need speed, power, and application of that power and speed

-Kick is neither a dolphin kick nor a frog kick: it‚Äôs somewhere in-between

-Hips should be as high as possible; likes double kick drill

-Head snaps up quick and snaps the head down once the hands are through. Keeps it natural

-Brett questioned why he doesn‚Äôt bring his heels all the way up to the hips in his kick. Peaty clarifies that he does but he just does it very fast. What he doesn‚Äôt do is he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúsend his feet outwards‚Äù (Keeps a narrow kick) and instead kicks straight back relying solely his feet for the propulsion

-Former philosophy that you can‚Äôt ‚Äúpull hard‚Äù. Peaty clarifies it‚Äôs okay to pull hard. Correct phrasing is you shouldn‚Äôt be *tense*. Stay fluid.

**Cameron Van Der Burgh**

-Focused on high frequency and tempo to go out faster than the 200 specialists‚Äô ability to catch him. Removed some power to be able to maintain the rate.

-Training: Would do lactic threshold sets to maintain the pace he used to hold

**Lydia Jacoby**

-Most People think of short-axis strokes as a cycle: Stroke-Stroke-Stroke instead of just going forward like freestyle. Breaststrokers should be thinking of the end goal which is to go forward and get to the other side of the pool

-Swims the Old-school style breaststroke like Leisel Jones: Always had a strong kick and weaker pull. Played to strengths to develop the stroke she currently has


**Max McHugh**

-Kick: doesn‚Äôt want to be too narrow or too wide

-Anchor elbows, don‚Äôt slide back, finishes out in front with head resting on bicep

-Finish stroke with hands flat for more balance

-Likes kicking in position drills for better feel: 1. Arms at side 2. Hands in armpits 3. Hands on chin 4. Hands out front where you want to finish

**Michael Andrew**

-Wider breaststroke kick: Takes the approach because groins can handle it; views the stroke as completely leg driven. Combined with his tall frame, results in lower stroke count. Allows him to save energy while going fast. Maximizes efficiency and power. No intention of changing.

-Make sure ‚Äúsnap‚Äù is still quick

-Described his American record as ‚Äúeffortless‚Äù

**Mel Marshall** (Coach of Adam Peaty)

-Basic Principles: Peaty does everything everyone else does but he does it faster than everyone else

-Peaty already had a great breaststroke and ultimately it was about not getting in his way other than small tinkering

-Peaty uses the whole of his forearms versus just the hands. ‚ÄúHe just sweeps‚Äù, never loses relationship with water. While his rate looks fast, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not fast for *him*‚Äù

-Equation for the 100: Optimal details- Breakout needed to hit stroke count, how to rehearse having him hit the wall into full finish. At capacity in certain aspects and optimizing the pieces of the puzzle that can always be improved

**Alia Atkinson**

-Breaststroke is personalized

-Focus on Speed, tempo, keeping hips up, and *holding the rhythm*

-When rhythm falters, identify what falls first and work on that weakness.

**Felipe Lima**

-Favorite Drill is double-kick breaststroke (Van Der Burgh style, kick-pull-kick)

-Throw your stroke forward not down

-Have to constantly hold your core and squeeze your butt

-Holds line at the surface, not below the surface

-Keeps chin tucked (Keeps tennis ball under chin as drill)

**Dave Salo** (USC and Trojan Swim Club Coach)

-Eliminate drag; doesn‚Äôt like Hands recovering over the water- Causes elbows to point down and cause drag

-Head Position aligned with back

-Shoulder driven not head driven

-Admired Kitajima‚Äôs ability to get into alignment through his kick

-Advocates more for a scull instead of a pull (References Peaty and Soni as demonstrations)

**Lily King**

PULLOUT

-Dolphin kick at the top-end; pullout has changed with the rule

-Try to be straight arm as possible and bring the hands in tight

PULL

-First thing to go is the forearms

-Works a lot on the breaststroke pull at Indiana

**Eric Shanteau**

2 changes he made when training with Eddie Reese

-Pull wider: When he finished his outsweep, his fingertips would be pointing at the lane ropes

-At the last minute on the in-sweep, when you think it‚Äôs too late, wait one second longer and then pick your head up and look straight across the other side of the pool. Enables you to naturally slide your hips forward under you. References Brendan Hansen.

-Already had a narrow and fast kick

**Summary**

ACROSS THE BOARD

-Keeping the hips high should be a priority

-Breaststroke is extremely technical and technique is different for every athlete

-For training, many swimmers like the double-kick drill. Of those swimmers, two advocated for the cycle to be performed in a kick-pull-kick fashion instead of a pull-kick-kick cycle that most swimmers do

-It‚Äôs generally accepted that kick width depends on the swimmer: Wide kick gives more power, Narrow kick allows for more tempo.

-Foot-speed is considered an important factor in keeping the body out of the resistance phase

-Emphasis should be on always moving forward 

DISCREPANCIES 

-Head position: Prenot, Peaty, and Shanteau have all advocated for lifting the head either slightly forward, or all the way in Shanteau‚Äôs case. Meanwhile, Dave Salo and Felipe Lima advocate for keeping the head either completely in line, or even tucked. Proponents for lifting the head argue that it allows the hips to slide forward, thus decreasing the amount of time in which you‚Äôre not moving forward (Peaty‚Äôs reasoning sounds more power/tempo based). Opponents argue that it causes the hips to drop.

-Sources of power: Peaty mentions that he uses his head to partially drive his stroke. Salo argues that the stroke should be shoulder driven

-The in-sweep: Peaty made a brief comment about ‚Äúwhipping his arms back‚Äù when he is unable to press more water. McHugh, on the other hand, emphasizes anchoring the elbows and not sliding back.

-Catch: Prenot and McHugh advocate for a deep catch- high elbows and fingertips down (like a butterfly pull). This technique has also been advocated by Cody Miller in his personal [Youtube vlogs](https://youtu.be/Iy0iA_W0gLQ). Salo places greater emphasis on a sculling motion referencing Rebecca Soni and Adam Peaty as examples. Marshall and Peaty‚Äôs description of what he focuses on appears to mostly be in line with what Salo described. Rationale for the first technique is physics based: Pull straight back to go forward. Salo‚Äôs rationale is most likely based on putting the body in the best position to lunge forward at max speed in the shoot phase.

-Tempo: Van Der Burgh asserts that you can no longer be a great 100 Breaststroker if you cannot perform a high-tempo because you will not be able to catch the sprinters and specifically trains the high tempo to be able to hold the pace. Michael Andrew considers his low stroke count an advantage so that he doesn‚Äôt fatigue.

-Fatigue: Atkinson mentions that the first thing to go is the legs while Lilly King comments that the first thing to go is the forearms according to Ray Looze (Indiana head coach). Could just be personal preference.

-Pull-width: Most Breaststrokers advocate for a narrow pull. Shanteau advocated for a very wide pull.

-The Upkick: When asked, Prenot and Lima acknowledged the upkick as a legitimate technique to potentially add some propulsion to the stroke (so long as you don‚Äôt kick down). Salo argues that a perfect kick is like Kitajima‚Äôs, in which the kick ends in alignment (thus, having an upkick would be adding to the time you are out of alignment). Brett remarks that what was once considered a perfect technique in Kitajima has evolved with the emergence of Peaty. Two types of ‚Äúperfect‚Äù breaststroke technique.",Swimming

I recently picked up swimming after never swimming in a pool and, while my first sessions were a disaster (couldn't do 50m without stopping), I managed to be able to swim a full kilometer without stopping in more or less 2 weeks.

I'm really happy about it, especially because I couldn't do a lap two weeks ago , but I'm having some trouble understanding how to get in rhythm (I only swam a full km without stopping twice).

I get in the pool and I'm miserable, barely finishing 400 meters, then I rest 2 minutes and start again and for the first 200 meters I'm struggling but then something switches on and my breath gets better, my arms hurt less and I feel more in sync, being able to finish a full km and only getting tired around the last 100 meters.

My question is, why? Do I always have to swim that much before getting in rhythm? Is there a way to train to do a full km from the start or a way to finally combine the 400m+1km?

1002,1709053270.0,Should I switch my 6-beat kick to a 2-beat kick?,"I've started swimming 2-3 days a week as a workout at my gym's pool. It's a 25m pool, and I usually do 4 sets of 4-5 laps each (lap being 1 back and forth).

I started by being able to do sets of 2 laps before gassing out and added sets each workout to keep it interesting and to get in better shape.

I did some googling and read that a 2 beat kick is better for longer swims because the less kicking lets you swim more before having to rest, So I did that, and I feel like I've gotten to the point where I have a rhythm to my stroke, but I feel like I'm actually getting more tired now than with my default 6 beat kick?

1006,1709046646.0,My progress :),"Hey there! I'm passionate about Googling and reading/watching how people progress in various skills. It provides me with a better understanding of what I can achieve, even though I know everyone's journey is unique. I'm really into data, statistics, tracking, and all that good stuff. I hope my data will provide some insight for anyone else interested in the same thing.

Just a quick background: My whole swimming experience, from not being able to swim, begins when I was 15-16 years old and joined swimming courses with 2 or 3 sessions per week. I liked it pretty much. Sadly, because of preparation for university, I stopped swimming after 1-2 years of starting. I don‚Äôt remember my times there, but I do recall feeling confident in my swimming abilities, despite not being particularly fast, as I had just learned to swim. After that, I didn't swim at all.

In the beginning of 2023, I met a guy who did an Ironman, and after I read more about this challenge, I always had it in my mind. I hated cardio and I really love lifting heavy weights. I joined a gym with a pool, and with the Ironman in mind, though not planning to participate, I started swimming again and warming up on the treadmill, even though I had never done it before.

From March 10, 2023, until May 6, when I did my 1900-meter test (half Ironman swimming distance), I swam 8 sessions totaling 4060 meters, approximately 500 meters per session or per week.

**Test: 6 of May 2023, Distance: 1900, Time: 1:00:19, Pace: 3:10/100m, Avg. Stroke rate: 13, Strokes: 1600(?)**

From May 6 until October 22, 2023, I completed 32 sessions, including the final test, covering a total distance of approximately 22km. This averages to approximately 680 meters per session, with 32 sessions spread over 24 weeks.

**Test: 22 October 2023, Distance: 1900, Time: 52:18, Pace: 2:45/100m, Avg. Stroke rate: 23, Strokes: 1214**

At the end of October, I decided to participate in a half Ironman and registered for it. From October 22 until January 31, 2024, I completed 24 sessions, totaling around 20km. This averages to approximately 830 meters per session, over a span of 14.5 weeks with 24 sessions.

**Test: 31 January 2024, Distance: 1900, Time: 46:41, Pace: 2:27/100m, Avg. Stroke rate: 25, Strokes: 1180**

As the Ironman approached in May, I increased the training volume. I did 8 sessions after the last test, resulting in 10km in total, plus the 1.9km from the last test. It's about two to three sessions per week.

**Test: 26 February 2024, Distance: 1900, Time: 43:56, Pace: 2:19/100m, Avg. Stroke rate: 26, Strokes: 1160**

The Ironman 70.3 event is scheduled for May 26th. I'm really hoping to complete the test with a pace of sub 2:00/100m. Do you think it's achievable, or is this where the real struggle begins?

1010,1709016597.0,Fin sizing questions,"I recently purchased [these Arena Powerfin Pro fins](https://www.arenasport.com/en_us/006151-powerfin-pro-ii.html#280=57128) and have questions! Note that I'm brand new to fin-wearing.

The fins are unisex so I bought the 6-7 size which is equivalent to women's 7.5-8.5. I'm a women's 7.5 and my toes are hitting against the edge of the foot area - is this normal? (I feel like someone with 8.5 feet would have to bend their toes to fit into these!) When my foot is at rest it's pretty uncomfortable, but when I tested them out in the pool they felt okay during the actual swim since the kicking motion gives my toes a little breathing room. But after I took them off the tops of my toes hurt. I can't tell if they hurt because of pressure from the repeated kicking motion (meaning any fin would cause this and I just need to build up tolerance) or if they hurt because the fins were too small. 

Today I tried on a larger pair (7.5-9 unisex so 9-10.5 women's according to their chart) and they were much more comfortable but also much floppier when I kicked them around in the air. I'm guessing that's not a correct fit, although my toes certainly were happier.

So basically: Does anyone have these fins and can advise on sizing? And is it normal for the tops of your toes to hurt when first starting out with fins?",Swimming

1056,1708882537.0,Learning to swim with face in the water as an adult,"As a kid I had about four years of school swimming lessons, but could never progress to any higher levels because while I was comfortable in water and perfectly capable on my back, I could not swim 25m front stroke as I could not swim with my face in the water. Nothing the instructors tried helped (although they mostly tried yelling ‚Äòface in the water!‚Äô at me for four years straight). 
Since then, not much changed - when swimming, I‚Äôm fine on my back but splutter and sink on my front. I had a small breakthrough last summer when I had the opportunity to go snorkelling over a coral reef. I forced myself to try because I didn‚Äôt want to miss out, and with the snorkel and mask I was a competent swimmer, and was even fine over incredibly deep water, which previously felt impossible. This proved to me that the only thing holding me back was the ability to put my face in the water and manage my breathing. I do have some sensory issues so that might play a part. Swimming with a snorkel was amazing, but I want to be able to swim in an emergency situation.
I am reluctant to pay for swimming lessons as they are expensive, and in my experience just made me feel terrible about myself. I would be very grateful for any advice anyone had for overcoming this particular barrier. Thank you!",Swimming

1078,1708806854.0,How to know whether to quit college sport or walk away?,"i‚Äôm a D1 competitive swimmer, (18 female) freshmen. I have been debating whether to say goodbye to my sport or not, and feel as I could really use some advice and opinions. I also have 2 more years of college yet, as I‚Äôll graduate early. So should I give it at least one more year or be done? Instead of having a big rant over why or why I shouldn‚Äôt quit, i‚Äôm listing it out instead. Any comments would be greatly appreciated. 

Why I‚Äôm considering quitting-
1. Injuries- I‚Äôve had problems in my shoulders/biceps and problems with my knees over my career. Some days it feels worse than others, but it‚Äôs stayed the same as far as consistently levels.
2. Not improving- Before I joined my college team, I was improving quite regularly with many PR‚Äôs but now I haven‚Äôt dropped any, but I have been adding excess amounts of time. It has really damaged my mental health. 
3. Burn out- Now this one is like 50/50 for me. Sometimes I think i‚Äôm ready to make my decision final but then I find it so hard to walk away. I‚Äôm currently at a conference swim meet, and I have had a terrible meet. Up until today, I was set on being done. But now that it‚Äôs actually our last day, I don‚Äôt know if I can actually say that. I guess you can say it‚Äôs such a love hate relationship.
4. Academics- I tend to make decent grades (could be better), but I find it difficult with always being so exhausted and busy to do great. My ‚Äúall‚Äù is just like me being held back by these factors. 
5. Coach- my coach isn‚Äôt the best. Is he the worst? no. But currently we don‚Äôt have an assistant coach, so he has a lot to take on.

Why i‚Äôm considering staying- 
1. Love for the sport- I‚Äôve always loved swimming, i feel like this is what I was meant to do. But then again when i‚Äôm not performing well, I don‚Äôt feel like the same girl.
2. Friendships- I value the friendships I have made and enjoy the social aspect. 
3. A purpose- If I quit, am I going to struggle with my identity?
4. Ending on a bad note- Is it wrong to quit on a bad season?
5. What if I make improvements next year? for instance, what if the coaching staff gets better? or what if I‚Äôm just going through a hard adjustment to a new environment?
6. People who used to look up to me- Younger swimmers, old teammates, etc. Quitting after what it looks like was a bad season isn‚Äôt something that I like to think about.
7. New living situation- As a freshmen who lived with other people, my sleep and recovery wasn‚Äôt great. But next year, regardless of what I do, I plan to get my own bedroom/apartment. 
8. Was my swimming career supposed to be more than how it was this season?

1112,1708706166.0,Rash Guard for casual swim older person - long vs short sleeve .. drag and stability in water,"Need advice looking to buy a rash guard (not swim shirt), this is for an older casual female swimmer who feels the water is cold in the indoor pool (while the water temperature is right for a regular swimmer it's a bit cold for her). The rash guard would be worn on top of the regular one-piece swimsuit.

My assumption is the size has to be quite snag because they get baggy in the water.  Two questions:

1. Anybody experience with these rash guards? Aqua Sphere, Speedo, Oneill?  I don't feel like I want to spend money on all of them only to find the one that fits. Hope I can narrow down just by looking at criteria e.g. Oneill seems has best reputation but Speedo is almost in every online shope. Aqua Sphere has that little tag on the front bottom allowing it to be tied to swim suit bottom I guess in case the short gets too loose and baggy in water to prevent going up.
2. Recommendation long vs short sleeve? This is for indoor pool. How much drag will the long sleeve? Her arms are quite thin, so I am worried the long sleeves will get baggy in water an will cause a lot of drag when moving hands. Is the long sleeve more difficult to remove than the short sleeve when wet?

1114,1708689244.0,Is -10s in 100m FC in 9 months a realistic swimming goal?,"Hi all,

28 y/o masters swimmer. I started competitive swimming in Sep 2022 (only learnt basic swimming as a child). In Oct 23, I had my 1st comp & did 100m in 1:21. At a 2nd comp more recently, I hit 1:18.

My long-term goal is to swim 100m in <1:00.

My current training is:

* Swim 2x / wk 1hr sessions w/ masters club
* Swim 1x a fortnight 1hr session w/ private coach for form/technique
* Swim 2x / wk public sessions (endurance & sprinting)
* Gym 2x / wk, mostly explosive compound movements & calisthenics
* 5k run every day

To make my goal more digestible, I want to break it down into milestones & think -10s by the end of 2024 is reasonable. However, this is based purely on intuition, so I'd like to get your views on its feasibility. Also, are there any good methods for extrapolating swimming progress forwards & establishing goals?",Swimming

A staff member came around with a clipboard, asked if I could swim and if I was free on a certain date (I answered yes - I had swimming lessons several years ago) and I was signed up on the spot, without being given other details.

On the day I found out I had to do individual medley and it was a far bigger event than I expected. multi-tiered stands, lots of people watching, olympic-style pool with diving blocks, referees etc... It was such a stupid idea, I didn't think about what I was signing myself up for.

I had never dived off a block but my competitors were standing on them so I felt I had no choice. Dived into the water on the whistle, winded myself on landing, swallowed a ton of water and had to break into butterfly stroke... In reality, I was gasping to stay alive and just had to do a mixture of doggy-paddle inbetween attempts at the correct stroke.

It took me several minutes longer than the second slowest person, the lifeguard had left his chair and was standing at the edge of the pool the entire time, and worst of all when I reached the end, my arms were so weak and jellified that I couldn't lift myself out of the pool. It took a minute of struggling before one of the next event's contestants reached a hand out to pull me up out of the water...

All watched by probably 200 people.

Oh, and then my legs felt so weak that I struggled to even walk off stage, a referee had to give me their seat so I could recover first.

Question: I was in the pool last night for 30 min trying to swim some laps and practice various parts of my stroke.  I was playing around with trying to keep one eye in the water when breathing, I tend to have to look a few degrees behind me to make this happen, rather than look 90 degrees to my left or right, otherwise I take in too much water.  


Even with this, when I turn to inhale, the bottom half of my mouth sucks in water (I am better about not swallowing any), and the top half of my mouth takes the air in.  However it seems like the amount of water that gets in is reducing the amount of air I can inhale.  


So while it feels like i MAY be turning to breathe a bit more efficiently, I am still getting out of breath after 25 or 50y because I am unable to get enough air into my lungs.  


Is getting water into your mouth normal on almost every breath? If it is, then it would mean that this isn't the problem with my lack of air/oxygen/getting tired, and I need to find out what else is wrong (there are hundreds of things lol).

1199,1708445083.0,Splashing while using kickboard,"I've started swimming about 3x a week last year, just to get an hour to clear my mind, get in some cardio and maintain some recent weight loss. Nothing serious, no lessons. Most of the time head-out breaststroke, water polo stroke, or kickboard, but front crawl or backstroke if I'm feeling particularly motivated.

When I started, I noticed a few regulars at the pool with rather aggressive splashing when on a kickboard, and only when they're on a kickboard. I didn't think too much about it since it seemed like that was the point of the thing. 

I moved cities in the meantime, and luckily for me there's a city pool 2 blocks from work that I can wander over to on my lunch break and continue my swimming. In one of my first sessions, in the lane next to me, there's a regular who goes through a cycle of strokes, including a few laps with a kickboard. And when he gets on it, the splashing from his kicks is ***volcanic****.* As in, his splashing is hitting two lanes over explosive. I usually go head down to avoid, but since it's in the middle of the day in Florida, he's usually also hitting retirees in their visors and sunglasses out for some casual laps. It's like a scene from a comedy film. Luckily, he usually only does about 4 laps of kickboard each session.

Watching him, even with my limited knowledge of swimming, it seemed like bad form to make that much splashing. My understanding of physics makes me think the energy used to launch water out of the pool is wasteful and could be better used to propel yourself forward (I usually have no more than a slight churn with my kickboard and usually go as fast as him) Also, since he doesn't kick like that while doing his front crawl, it seems like it may reinforce bad kicking form.

But a few days later, another swimmer who seemed much more experienced than him - she had the most beautiful front crawl and efficient flip turn I've seen - got on her kickboard and did the same thing, not as much, but still quite splashy.

So it got me thinking: *should I be doing the same? Is this taught behavior?*

Or are there other reasons it happens? Is the angle of attack changed, positioning the legs differently causing more splashing? Is it an exercise not in form or speed but in pure strength building? Is it just fun to do and hard to resist, much like popping bubble wrap is fun if it's in front of you?

Apologies for the long post, but it's just been something on my mind lately. Any theories or advice on whether or not I should or should not be splashing too is greatly appreciated!

I have had to change my swimming speed and cut my length short because of YOU, because you are going so slowly!. (There were 2 other people in the same lane who were going slower than me)

How rude! if she was unhappy with the speed she should have gone into the fast lane, or politely asked to go ahead of me so we had a longer distance between us.

Keep in mind we were in the slow/ medium lane and the pool was mainly being used a a play area for kids, thats why there were only 2 lanes as it wasnt a session for serious swimmers or anything it was just a leisure swimming session.

I'm a triathlete who swims 2-3 times a week and since I've started swimming I've had occasional big issues with acne showing up. I am on a retinoid given to me by my doctor and we've tried several short-term solutions such as antibiotic treatments, which would help for as long as the treatment toon place, only for it to reappear as soon as I'm off treatment. The only time my acne seems to vanish is when I quit swimming for a week or more. However as I'm doing triathlons, not swimming is not an option. But my doctor and I are in agreement that the pool waters' impact on my face is probably the culprit. Is there anyone else who has this issue and who has found something that maybe helped? Are there any supplements or skincare products that might reduce or minimise the harm pool water does on my face? Or is there anyone else who can relate and has some words of comfort? I'm so sad, I love swimming so much and don't want to quit it, but the acne breakouts do take a toll on my confidence and mental health. They also hurt like shit most of the time.

Edit: I have a very well-constructed skincare routine with minimal but effective products that keep my skin clear as long as I avoid the pool. I also do not think it is a diet issue because as long as I don't swim, my skin remains clear. The issues only flare up when I get back into swimming and increase when I decide to swim more often.

I feel like the Gallop technique they used is far more efficient than the Straight arm freestyle we use for 100s or 50s.

1290,1708223567.0,HS Swim advice! (Fly focused),"This is going to be kind of long so please bear with me lol
I'm a freshman in HS this year. I swam the same three events every meet, 50 free (33.43 seconds), 100 free (1:11.84) and a 200 relay, my split time is usually a 32/33. The actual relay time varies, for my individual events those are my fastest times, each and every one is stuck at a cliff. 
This is my first year actually competitive swimming. In middle school there were 9 tragic hour long practices but they weren't very great so I don't really count those lol

I'm expected to be the flier next year. The other female flier (going to call her J) is a senior and will be graduating, therefore I have to take her place and replace her in the relays. My coach said I have the most potential for fly and she will have J work with me. The problem is J isn't a huge fan of me, just a weird thing she has bc of the age difference. So she helps but is kind of vague. I'd like advice from other fliers. I don't have videos of my fly or anything, but I know it's stiff in the upper back, and my hips drop as I do it, my legs also start falling apart What can I do for that? 

Back to the freestyle XD
The swim team I'm on is kinda small which sucks because we lose some of our best female swimmers due to them graduating and I'm the best up and coming thing they have, so there's a lot riding on me. There isn't any other meets this season, regionals was earlier this month, I went as an alternate. I finally, FINALLY corrected my issue where I was subconsciously lifting my head as I swam, but I fixed it after the meets ended so I haven't been able to see the difference in an actual meet. I also know my dive pikes a little bit. Any ideas for sets I could do, and advice for the dive?

Sorry if I rambled or made this too long! I'm spazzing out over all this as I don't want to let the team down since we lose a lot of important swimmers there's a big gap I need to close atleast a little",Swimming

1293,1708219663.0,AITAH?,"So, my local rec centre has 4 lanes, divided into slow, moderate, fast, and open. The lifeguards don‚Äôt enforce this unless they are asked to, and even then they aren‚Äôt great at it. People generally go in the lanes most suited to them, but occasionally people will use the fast lane as the overflow slow or open lane. It‚Äôs not usually terribly busy, so if there are only two of us, I‚Äôll try to stick to a side, or just pass repeatedly if they are insistent on circle swimming. Occasionally the slower swimmers also will stay out of the fast swimmers way, and I‚Äôm also happy to share the lane with them. ie they‚Äôll wait at the wall and time their length so they aren‚Äôt in the way at all. 
I had enough today. I kicked 4 people out of the fast lane. The lane swimming was only open for an hour, so having to continually slow down waiting to pass the slowpokes was irritating me. They were literally swimming slower than the people in the moderate lane. The first guy I asked to leave and join a more appropriate lane, did immediately. The next 2 joined together, and were so annoying. I asked them a few times to move to a more appropriate lane, but they ignored me. (There were 2 of us circle swimming in the fast lane when they joined). They also knew no etiquette, and repeatedly pushed off the wall just as I was coming in to turn, and I‚Äôd have to wait for the other swimmer to come so I could pass them. After the 4th or 5th time they did this I hollered for the lifeguards to get them to move, and they immediately moved to the slow lane, where they should have been in the first place.  At the end of the swim there were 3 of us in the fast lane, and one of the women switched from free to breast, and again, was swimming slower than the people in the moderate lane next to us. I asked her to please change to a more appropriate lane if she was going to slow her pace down, and she gave me an angry look but did revert back to free. 
I feel bad and do feel like I am an asshole, but also how inconsiderate and entitled are people to just join the fast lane and clearly disrupt the quicker swimmers.

1331,1708127520.0,Need A Santity Check On Circle Swimming,"Yesterday, I was at my local pool. It was fairly quiet and almost everyone had their own lane. Typically when I am by myself in a lane, I swim straight down the middle. If someone gets in with me, we split the lane. If a third person gets in, we circle swim, etc. etc.

I was by myself in the lane swimming down the middle when I guy walked up and sat on the edge of the pool and started chatting up the woman in the lane next to me. I kept going through my sets and when I stopped to rest, he looked at me and said ""you should be circle swimming"". I was very confused, because I've never been told I had to circle swim alone. I asked him if he would be joining me in the lane. He said ""yes, but you should be circle swimming"". I responded to him asking him if we could just split the lane instead. He said no and that the lifeguard had said she wanted everyone to circle swim (mind you, the other 2 lanes that have 2 people in them are split, not circle swimming) . The lifeguard happened to overhear at this point and asked what he said. He reiterated that she wanted us to circle swim and she looked at the both of us and said ""no, I don't think I said that. I don't really care what you do.""

At this point, the woman in the lane next to me whom he had been chatting up piped up and said that she would be willing to circle swim with him, to which he strongly hinted that he would not be circle swimming with her, because she was too slow. He stays chatting with her on the side of the pool (mind you at this point, I have swam a good 500+ meters since he told me he would be getting in the lane with me). Then, he hops in the lane and stands at the end of the lane with his arms spread out covering the entire wall so that I had to do advanced acrobatics to ensure that my feet did not accidentally touch his hand on my flipturn.

He stands there for another 200 meters or so. Eventually the woman in the lane next to me gets out and he ducks over into her open lane, swims approximately 200 meters and leaves.

I wish I was making this up, but I was genuinely so confused by this whole interaction. I cannot stop thinking about it more than 24 hours later. I have only been swimming as an adult (I swam competitively as a kid, but that was always in practice settings run by a coach) for about a year or so, so not sure if I'm totally off-base on my etiquette here.

I started swimming again three weeks ago and could barely swim a 500. But, muscle memory is an amazing thing, you guys, and it came back pretty damn fast. This week I swam multiple times and did 500s consistently. Felt much easier these last few times. So, on my plight to work back up to my former levels, today I swam 2000 yards without stopping. Then added in a few extra sets in my hopes to get to 3000 and work up to that masters swim challenge I see some of you post about. 

Well, I swam another 200 and something wasn‚Äôt right. How many laps did I just swim? Looked at my tracker and saw that I had burned 840 calories. Wow, did I used to burn this much every time? Seems good. I should probably stop. Hopped out of the pool. Instant headache. Then exhaustion. Then shakey. Hypoglycemic. 

Asked the lifeguards if there was a vending machine around because I needed sugar. Well, apparently I looked as bad as I felt because they told me I had no color and needed to sit down and then they rushed to the office and came back and handed me a couple emergency glucose pills. Had to convince them I was fine and did not need them to write an incident report üòÖ. Fun stuff. Guess I forgot that when I was swimming this much when I was younger, not only was I used to it, but I was also eating way more.

I just wasn‚Äôt feeling healthy, in fact I felt like a fat slob because I actually was one. 

Before I started swimming again, I went to quest and got a battery of tests, and the results showed just how far I had to go to get my body healthy. Little did I know that a slight change in diet, adding a breakfast of oatmeal daily when before there was none, stopping my ‚Äúbeer after work‚Äù habit, and joining two masters teams (6 workouts/week) would change cholesterol levels so quickly.

In order:

Total cholesterol
HDL
LDL
NON HDL

I don‚Äôt know if this is relevant, but the PSA dropped .6 also, with several other great results- but none as stunning as this cholesterol.

When I wear fins, I feel like a dang mermaid and can swim effortlessly!  What an amazing feeling it is!  Though, once those fins come off, it's an immediate, drastic, negative difference.  Today we tried putting the pool buoy between my thighs, my knees, and also between my ankles and just pull with the upper body.  My body immediately wants to fold in half like a taco (from the stomach) and my legs sink immediately...WITH the buoy between my legs.  My upper body is parallel to the waterline and my legs are 45 degrees+ pointing downward.  Keep in mind that my head is in the water when this is happening as I realize the concept of head up/legs sink.  

I also have a horrendous kick and flexing my ankles is a struggle.  I cannot tread water while straight up and down in the water without using my hands to help.  Same as with my freestroke, I put the fins on and effortless treading.  When I do kickboard drills, it's an extreme struggle to go forward.  The concept of using my hips and top of my feet for propulsion makes complete sense in my head but is absolutely foreign to my body.

I have been swimming in speedo endurance+, size 34. They are a good fit, over the time they adjusted to my size.

Recently I ordered a Speedo splice square leg. They either have a M or L. Went with L and it is a bit roomy compared to size 34 endurance+. Should I keep it or go an M? And does the difference in material impact the size over time. 

Edit: I got both L and M. The M fits a little snug but it's better fit and could stretch over time. ",Swimming

Even though it only lasted two years the enjoyment and memories I found were incredible and I plan to keep swimming with one of the local clubs,  then move on to Masters once I‚Äôm too old. I‚Äôm definitely not fast enough for any college level team!

With that said, I‚Äôd like to receive some outside perspective on what times should I go for once I start swimming competitively again (The club season starts in March, right now I‚Äôm just swimming laps).

Here is my event progression in my high school events:

100 FL: 1:34.13 (JR year) -> 1:16.84 (SR year)
100 FR: 1:15.39 (JR year) -> 1:06.86 (SR year, relay)

50 FL: 39.27 (JR year) -> 31.34 (SR year, relay)

1385,1707956495.0,Help finding USA Swiming sanctioned Meets,"TLDR: My most recent USA Swimming times are 2 years old. I can't find USA Swimming sanctioned meets I can swim at to (hopefully) qualify for olympic trials. Any advice?


So, my ultimate goal is to qualify for US Olympic Trials this year in the 50 free. The problem is I haven't  competed since I graduated college in 2022, so I don't have any times still valid for USA swimming. On top of that, trials only accepts LCM qualifying times.

Another compounding issue is that I'm not associated with a swim club or coach. I practice by myself and write my own practices. All of the meets I've seen online through Ohio Swimming require coach-member supervision (I don't know how they check this or if it's actually important), but since I have no coach, that will be difficult. I'm also too old for most meets and clubs around me seeing as I've already graduated college.

I have looked into US Masters Swimming, but very few of their meets are sanctioned by USA Swimming and all of the large USA Swimming meets (Speedo Sectionals, TYR pro series, etc...) have qualifying time standards.

My plan is to qualify for speedo sectionals in SCY at a smaller meet, then go for a trials cut at sectionals, which is in LCM. I'm just having trouble finding a USA Swimming sanctioned meet I can swim at in my vicinity (~3 hours). 

I know the winter season is just winding down, so more summer LCM meets will start getting posted, but I would prefer not to wait until the last moment to try and qualify.

Im not quite sure how to proceed and I will be eternally grateful for any advice. Thanks!

I'm in school and recently started a high-stress job. The pool is where I come to let out pent up aggression and lose myself on the endless black line. Listen, I know my form needs work. My flip turns are ugly as hell. I only breathe on one side. My workout has remained unchanged for years. But that's for a reason- it's because I swim for literally hours without using any brain cells which is exactly what I need. 

So when someone, with truly good intentions, praises me on my smoothness, but mentions just a few things I could work on to help push me to the next level, I do not appreciate it. I wasn't even halfway through my big workout of the week and those few little comments took me completely out of the zone. Now I'm hyperfixating on what I need to change. My breaths are all fucked up. I'm moving my arm in unnatural ways. My flip turns are even worse.

My building‚Äôs pool is 35 feet long, so here‚Äôs how my typical mile session goes. I gotta swim 151 laps (which feels comical). I‚Äôll do 60 freestyle, then 10 breaststroke, another 20 freestyle, and then 10 back and forth between breaststroke and freestyle until I hit 151. This legit takes me almost an hour to complete which feels LONG.

My immediate thoughts:
I think I keep my feet up while kicking, although I definitely catch myself dragging them sometimes - I assume gotta work on my core to fix that?

I can‚Äôt figure out how to flip turn. I‚Äôve gotta think that helps cut down on energy expenditure a ton? I‚Äôm just tapping the wall and turning around like suicides in middle school.

I have to take a quick breather at the wall pretty much every 2 laps. Idk how tf some folks are just popping back and forth, that‚Äôs insane. I‚Äôm just gonna keep at it and hope I get used to it but atm I can‚Äôt fathom how that‚Äôs done.

So throwing it to this group. Is there a training plan beginners should follow? Am I just a thicc boy and that‚Äôs how this goes for guys like us? Is a mile just under an hour really not THAT bad?

I thought this meet was this Sunday (Feb 18) and didn‚Äôt sign up until last Friday (Feb 9) when I went to check the date. I hadn‚Äôt ramped up my distance sets to doing 500s in practice regularly so on Saturday (the day before the meet) I did 2 500s at a steady pace after my warm up to prepare for the 500. I am extremely proud of the time I went for basically not being prepared. The 500 was my main event when I was much faster and it felt amazing to race it again. I‚Äôve always loved racing in the 500, I feel like it‚Äôs the best event to race people in. I had an amazing race with the guy next to me where I was a body length behind him and I slowly crept up and then zoomed past him in the last 150 to beat him by over a body length, I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2 for perspective.

1468,1707757989.0,Devices for counting laps,"Hey all.

I currently use a sport count lap counter (one of the little devices that fits around your finger like a ring and has a button and just counts), but I'm on my third one in a year and a half, the first two having developed leaks. They're *definitely* not high tech devices - they literally just count - but they do nevertheless cost about $40 each. Perfectly reasonable if they work, but as I'm starting to use my third one they're becoming rather pricy as an overall method! And I'm having a hard time finding the version that just counts, which makes me wonder if the company is in trouble. So I'm starting to look for other options.

Most of what I'm seeing are serious smartwatches - Garmin, apple, I think some people have mentioned Samsung. I have no interest in a smartwatch. It would not be useful to me in the rest of my life. I really just want something that lets me use my brain for something other than an endless litany of one one one one... Two two two two... Three three oh, what's that pile of pine needles on the floor for four four wait was I on three or four? Oh gosh, I've been swimming as I debate numbers is this still three? Four? Oh maybe five? You get the picture.

Are there devices that are perhaps an intermediate level between the sport count rings that lose their seal after a couple months and the smart watches? Alternatively, do the smartwatches last? At this point a smart watch that lasts three years would break even with the sport count rings... If they're even still being made.

The single most important game of our season is in 2.5 weeks, and I managed to sprain my ankle last night stepping off a curb.
I haven't gotten it checked out (I usually don't for ankle sprains) but I think it's a Grade I medial sprain‚Äîthe injury is on the inner side of my ankle. Currently it's pretty painful to bear weight and twist/turn my ankle. I can walk but not without a pretty obvious limp. I anticipate that treading water will hurt quite a bit. (Though interestingly, it's not that swollen.) 

I've checked out some past threads here and most people have seemed to say that freestyle with a sprained ankle should be fine, but breaststroke is a no-go. Eggbeater, unfortunately, is quite like breaststroke kick... 

I'm a starter and this is my last game with my university team, so there's no way I'm going to miss the game for this, but I was wondering what you all thought about whether or not I should take some time out of practice and dryland. Not sure how to balance resting the ankle against staying in shape/getting in playing time in the weeks leading up to the big game. What do you think is the best way to maximize performance in 2.5 weeks' time?

1475,1707737117.0,How do you embrace sprint sessions ? Distance swimmer.,"I‚Äôm a distance swimmer and I love a set of hard repeats with little rest. I can sustain a higher effort for a very long period of time and although it feels very tough at times, it‚Äôs not tooooo mentally uncomfortable, for me. I push through the hard and really enjoy doing so. 

However, when our coach gives us sprint sets it feels physically and mentally draining and there‚Äôs no joy. I hate every second. I physically feel dreadful every second.

I do it, and I actually do well in comparison with other swimmers my age, but I FEEL like I could do better if I could be a little more comfortable during the process. Or is it completely awful for everyone to sprint? 

I know these sets can be very useful as a swimmer, so I need to do them. 

For those of you who feel good/enjoy sprint sets, what is it that gets you through the repeats??

1477,1707715529.0,A difference a year makes.,"I got back into swimming, last year, almost 25 years after I learnt swimming when I was a little boy. Last year, when I started out I had to take a break after 25 yards, and then within a couple of weeks (swimming 2-3 times a week) I was able to get to 50 yds (2 laps) and gas out. Rest and then do 2 more laps and so on. I bought a swim snorkel and would try to swim laps to build endurance.

For the longest time my breathing was still not good. And I wasnt swimming regularly until September. After that I was bit more consistent of going atleast 2 times a week. And slowly was able to wean off the snorkel. After doing 20 - 30 laps with breaks I would switch to using fins and do about 20 more laps. By December I managed to nail down my breathing and I started swimming 3-4 times a week. And I was able to do 30 laps without stopping.

Over the last month my endurance improved drastically, to the point where I was able to do 50 laps-60 laps without stopping. Today I managed to do 2500 yds (100 laps) without stopping. Now I enjoy swimming laps, and its become very meditative.

I need to add flip turns to my repertoire and work on learning dolphin kicks. Its been a real tough journey especially in the beginning, where I doubted if I could ever swim 10 laps non stop.

It was a great experience letting them do the counting so I can let my mind wander without getting frustrated.  But the timing features were great too.  Timing the pace of every lap immediately after the turns, keeping a running time so I don't need to use the wall clock.  The best thing is, unlike a watch, the display is visible at all times while you swim.  You don't have to wait until you stop swimming to see your results.

This is a long story. I picked up open water swimming in 2014 and went serious in 2018. I lived in Hong Kong and there are supportive groups who do serious distance, however I moved to London in 2022. Before I left Hong Kong, I swam 20 - 25 km / week with various people however I didn't make any speed improvement as the swimming pools were closed in the pandemic, and I couldn't do any interval training as a result.

After I moved to London, I spent a winter in the pool (2022-2023) solely for speed training. I didn't have a job in that winter. I made speed improvement in races up to 5 km open water, but it didn't translate to any significant speed gain over a long distance. I then got a job and, unfortunately, I had to stop my speed training as my friend pointed out that my form was too bad to swim the English Channel. I worked on my efficiency in order to survive it, and after that my speed never recovered. And now I have got a full time job that I don't want to quit, and it is too tiring to train like the previous winter when I made improvement. In addition, I started doing cold water training which cannibalised my pool time, and I have got more entertainment as well, and I ended up swimming only on average 8 km / week, and I dreaded every warm session.

I took a holiday and went back to Hong Kong for 18 days, during this period I stayed away from any swimming pools and only swam in the sea. Once I went back to the sea I could pump out great distance again, however as I didn't have enough training, I ""survived"" a 14 km race by just my endurance base, with a worse result then preceding years.

I'm returning to London soon where it is impossible to do sea swimming. I don't really have motivation to get into the warm pool as I can't swim often enough to get significant improvement while having a full time job, and I am considering stopping swimming for 3 months until the race season starts, such that I can try to lose my ""channel fat"" which now makes me unsinkable in the ocean.

What will happen to my race season if I really stop swimming for 3 months? Will it be very difficult to start training again before the race season?",Swimming
1501,1707644447.0,Just Started Learning Swimming & I Love It So So So So So So So So Much!!,"Hello swimmers! Just wanted to share something today with you all!

## A Quick Background

I(M,20s) started learning to swim a few days ago for the first time in my life. I managed to swim comfortably within the first 5 days. Yesterday I managed to swim all four strokes. Two of them (butterfly and backstroke) aren't perfect yet but I am proud of myself. 

## I Love & Enjoy Swimming So So So So So So Much

I just can not get over the feeling of enjoyment and joy that I get out of swimming. My heart never fills up, even when my body is tired and aching for rest. One day, I swam for 3 hours. When I dried up and changed my clothes, as I was leaving, I still wanted to jump in the pool. I have never felt so much excitement for an activity before this. Perhaps when I was a kid, I might have been excited about various things but I don't remember. I wish I was excited like this for other activities as well, you know, like my job :). I learned various things over the years in my 20s, like coding, cooking, art, etc. But nothing gave me the joy that I am getting now with swimming. Every single day I look forward to going to the pool. I swim every single day. Even when I strength train I swim. Even when I am tired I swim. If a friend wakes me up in the middle of the night and asks me if I want to swim, I am ready. One night before sleeping I was watching a particular stroke and I got so pumped up to try it that I started looking for swimming pools that were open at 1:30 am. I couldn't find any and had to restlessly go to bed.

Am I insane?! Do any of you share similar sentiments? Will this feeling fade away after a while? I don't know what exactly is making me so pumped up. Is swimming widely an enjoyable exercise for most people?!",Swimming

1514,1707599914.0,Keeping track of swimming over period of time?,"Hi all,

Thanks for answering my question yesterday about how many laps/yards/metres etc you do per session in a pool.

Next month I am doing a charity swim where I swim 59km over a few weeks to raise sponsorship money. 

Last year, I did a swimming challenge for MacMillan Cancer Support, which offered a tool on their website to let me log my distance every day. 

This time I am using JustGiving for another charity, and i am keen to update people who make pledges on how far I am into the challenge. Often, they'll say things like ""let me know when you get to 50% and I'll donate!"" etc.

Are there any apps that will let me set a challenge, e.g, for the 59KM swimming distance, and let me log my distance every day and track the grand total? If it helps, I have a Fitbit that I often wear, but I don't think the Fitbit app allows you to create a challenge for yourself.",Swimming
1515,1707598235.0,Transitioning to the Next Stage in My Fitness Journey,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm new to a lot of this ‚Äî that being said, I apologize in advance if the questions I‚Äôm about to ask are redundant/annoying in any way.

I started my fitness journey about a year ago (last March to be exact). Back then, I weighed about 170-ish lbs. (for context, I was a 22-year old now 23-year old male, about 5‚Äô7). To lose weight, I did the norm ‚Äî CICO (ate about 1,600 kcal daily), and started with walking & eventually running about 4 days per week. In about mid-November, I hit 148 lbs., and I‚Äôve been fluctuating in the mid 140s ever since. Long story short, I‚Äôve plateaued after becaming tired of dieting, running outside in the cold (I hate running in the gym), and to be honest I was starting to look too skinny. (My initial goal was 140 lbs. ‚Äî but I just don‚Äôt know if that is reasonable or healthy for me. I‚Äôd love feedback on this, if anyone has any thoughts.) In sum, I knew it was time to move onto the next stage.

I decided I would figure out my new plan at the start of the new year. To summarize the changes I made:

1) Upped my intake to roughly 1,770 kcal daily (for reference, my TDEE is about 2,270 kcal).

2) Started doing strength training twice a week (one day core and one day rotating between legs & arms).

3) Started swimming twice a week. (Please, see attached a screenshot with stats of my best swim thus far.)

4) Cut back to running only once a week.

5) Started focusing on eating more protein (shakes, bars, etc.).

My experience thus far has been a lot more difficult than I expected. I understand that instead of just trying to lose weight like before, now my focus is losing fat. It‚Äôs. So. Much. Harder! When I was just losing weight before, I kind of went on auto-pilot ‚Äî just told myself to eat less and run 4 days a week. But now, I have to focus on what I‚Äôm eating, how I‚Äôm working out, and more numbers than just the one on the scale. 

Since I started this new plan, I‚Äôve noticed a few changes with my body:

1) MUCH more tired than before. 

2) MUCH more hungry than before.

3) Workouts (kind of) feel easier? (This one just may be subjective or the fact I‚Äôm not slamming my joints against pavement every day any more).

4) My motivation has taken a hit.

The above have put me in a whirlwind of constantly trying to keep myself afloat ‚Äî and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm not doing very well thus far. Over the past 3 weeks especially, I‚Äôve been slipping on my diet & I‚Äôve probably gained about 3ish lbs. back.

I don‚Äôt want to seem like one of those people who posts on here without having done their research ‚Äî for the most part, I know what I have to do. I‚Äôm just not sure if the way I‚Äôm doing it is sustainable or even just efficient. 

My questions:

1) Do I need to change my workout regiment? (Sunday - Run, Monday - Arms or Legs, Tuesday - Swim, Wednesday - Off, Thursday - Swim, Friday - Core, Saturday - Off)

2) Do I need to modify my intake in any way? (More or less? Having just focused on eating less for months while losing weight, eating more is uncomfortable and seems unintuitive to me ‚Äî but again, this is all new to me.)

3) Any other general advice is appreciated. Feel free to ask me any questions about anything I haven‚Äôt covered!

I‚Äôll also share a few pictures of what I currently look like. Took these yesterday ‚Äî 149.4 lbs., 23.4 BMI, 24.7% Body Fat, 42.4% Body Water, and 31.6% Muscle Mass. 

Thank you in advance for your help and support!

I won‚Äôt quit just yet.,"Last night I got out of the pool completely demoralized after sucking wind throughout my time practing freestyle (and some backstroke) in the pool.  Have been taking lessons since September + 1-2 days practicing on my own. No matter what I was doing, I was completely gassed after 25 or 50 yards.  I posted a rant on here last night comparing the lack of progress between a few months ago and yesterday. 


I was surprised at all of the feedback and comments that I received. A lot of extremely helpful feedback, video suggestions and positive vibes. I spent last night and a lot of time today trying to respond to as much as I could. However the more I responded, the more down I got on myself about my lack of progress and how bad I am at anything that I try. 


After reading some helpful feedback and watching a couple of helpful videos. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about getting into the pool again tonight to give it another shot. I mean I literally had a headache by 6pm because I was thinking so much about it. (The pool lanes didn‚Äôt open until 730pm due to the swim team and other stuff, and I couldn‚Äôt go during the day due to work and other commitments ). 



I got there at 720pm to be sure that I could snag a lane and was pleased to see one was already available. I hopped in, took a deep breath and tried to clear my mind and just focus on easy swimming and breathing.  It was not the most graceful thing to behold, but I made a huge effort to kick less than I was before.   I basically gave 2 light kicks every time I reached with my right arm. I would breathe (and not kick) when I reached with my left. 


I still couldn‚Äôt get more than a 50 at a time, and I would have to get on my back for a length if I wanted to stretch it into a 75.  But overall I needed less time to rest and catch my breath when I took breaks. And overall I was able to do many more 50s of freestyle than usual. 


It wasn‚Äôt perfect by any means, and I was still breathing pretty hard a lot of the time. But I was happy to be able to get some additional yardage in within my allotted swim time. 

I am not looking to be a fast swimmer. I just would love to be able to get into the pool and swim for a half hour or longer without having to stop and catch my breath after 50 yards. I would love to transition that into being able to get into the open water nearby and swim with some guys at my summer pool when they hop into the Long Island sound and do a mile or whatever it is that they do when the weather is nice.

1600,1707360143.0,Is there such a thing as a weak diaphragm/weak respiratory muscles? Feels like I'm breathing against a corset after 100 yards,"TL;DR at bottom.

So for background, I'm not super new to swimming, but new to swimming consistently and actively working yo build my endurance. My form is...okay. Could use work. I'm very lean and sink like a rock.

So here's the thing. I swim my first 50 of front crawl just fine. Breathing feels smooth and mostly effortless, of course. Then the next 50, I feel it getting more difficult to get a full breath of air. Then onto my 200, I feel like the pressure if the water is stopping me from getting enough air. I know how to breath without lifting my head. One goggle stays in the water and I move at a moderate speed.

My endurance could definitely be better, but it almost feels like my diaphragm/respiratory muscles aren't pushing the air where it needs to go. I also get progressively sinkier despite ""trying"" to engage my core and keeping a neutral down looking head position. Basically when I start, I feel I can fill my lungs with air with ease, then it gets progressively harder as I get fatigued. And yes, I am exhaling all the air in my lungs underwater.

I feel like it's a solid mix of weak core, weak diaphragm and maybe I'm also not directing the air to where it needs to go? A lot of people on here talk about belly breathing to help buoyancy. Not sure I'm doing that. Also as I said, my form could be better but I see swimmers all the time with terrible form, yet they can swim front crawl for an eternity no stopping and not look like someone strapped a brick to their ass...

TL;DR. I start off breathing with ease during front crawl. By 150 yards, I feel like i can only get 50% breath and it feels like I'm breathing against a ton of pressure even though I exhale fully in the water. Can weak diaphragm and/or respiratory muscles be a factor here that may get better with time and drills?",Swimming

But the issue is that I tense up, can‚Äôt float, seem to resist the water and sink. It‚Äôs nothing I‚Äôm consciously doing, I‚Äôm not overthinking the movements, it just seems to happen.

Has anyone experienced this and gotten over it? Can anyone give any specific suggestions to build confidence? Thank you",Swimming

I swam in high school, stopped, gain some weight, and am now trying to lose it at 20.

My only goal at the moment is weight loss/aesthetics/body recomposition, so I‚Äôm not worried about speed or longer distances. I can workout however many days a week for however long. I‚Äôm thinking:

Mondays - Legs

* Leg press, leg extension, hip thrusts, hip adductions, hip abductions (lower weight, more reps)
* Swimming (with leg emphasis)

Wednesdays - Arms

* Chest press, shoulder press, lat pulldown, tricep extensions, bicep curls (three sets of each, lower weight, more reps)
* Swimming (with arm emphasis)

Saturdays - Full Body

* Cable row, lat pulldown, leg press, abdominal crunch machine, leg extension (lower weight, more reps)
* Swimming (including HIIT)

Every snorkel I have ever used, be it purchased from a store, handed out at a swimming pool or provided for Manatee watching, every single one without fail, has always leaked around the sides of  the mouthpiece. In a short time I will be where I can start learning to snorkel and, hopefully, SCUBA. So this long standing problem is something I need some idea on how to fix.

Since people will assume. Yes I had tried searching the net. The responses are entirely about damaged snorkels or leaking masks. This has happened whether I had facial hair or not. Not that I can see how that matters for something the fits entirely inside the mouth.

&#x200B;

In a pool or a cold ocean connected river, it hasn't mattered. Every single time I ever tried to use one, it leaked around the mouthpiece. Purchased or provided. And not just a little drop every once in awhile, but a slow steady trickle. I tried sucking in as hard as I could. Tensing lips. Biting and pulling on the rubber tips protruding into the mouth. Never changed anything. A constant trickle of water in the mouth makes it rather hard to breath without aspirating. Pushing the water forward into the snorkel and exhaling hard helped only a minor amount. I have been extremely frustrated by this over the years.",Swimming

I have a younger swimmer, lets call her Mary but I am having three major problems with her and her parents that I have not had before. 

1. Practicing outside of scheduled practice. I have no problem with this if it does not affect the regularly scheduled practice. However, with the swimmer being so young (and honestly I don't even think she enjoys swimming that much), I truly believe that the extra ""practice"" she's doing is making her more tired for the actual practice. She also ""practices"" the incorrect technique that I work to fix at regular practice, so there has been absolutely no progress with her technique. 
2. Swimming the same events every meet. Mary swims the same four events (three 25s and a 50) every single meet she goes to and expects to drop time. I have explained to Mary and her parents MULTIPLE times she has to try different events and not swim the same thing every single meet. Also our team practices for mid distance events, and she is more than capable of swimming longer events. 
3. Asking to speak with coaches after practices and meets. After almost every practice or meet, I find myself having the same discussion with the parents: what they need to do and what the child needs to do to see improvements. However, they often respond in a passive aggressive way like ""Maybe it's because you're not working on this"" or ""Maybe you should focus more on this at practice"". Mary wants to ask me when she can move up almost every practice, and gets upset when I tell her that she is not ready. 

Last week, the parents went as far as to question my coaching credentials and experience. I may be younger than the majority of coaches in my area, but I have six years of experience under my belt coaching both USA and HS swimming, and have developed multiple state/sectional level swimmers. These parents and quite honestly, this swimmer is starting to stress me out every time I coach this group. What should I do?",Swimming

I always specialized in distance swimming and have a pretty decent form. I don't really follow any training guides and mostly stick to freestyle distance, with some breast and back stroke sprinkled in.

I prefer to swim in open water and distances but considering I live in a place where winter ravages the land half the year, I have to swim in a pool right now.  I have been going about 3- 4 times a week, at 1.75 - 2.5 hours or more duration (if I have to get chlorine in my hair I may as well make the most of my work out)

Back when I was on pretty competitive team, my coach (who i had issues with) told me to skip Butterfly because I was mainly distance and only swam free for competition, especially since butterfly seemed to tweek something in my back and the doctor said try not to do it.

I see the point in using a kickboard as my kicking technique has always been the weakest part of my form and will dolphin kick, breast stroke kick along with the regular free style kick.

With that out of the way here are my questions.

1. Would a training lesson be at all helpful to me or just sticking to swimming distance with the occasional sprinting and breast and back thrown in is just fine enough? What major benefits would I be missing out on?
2. What is the point of the Pull buoy?  In all my years it just felt like it was further encouraging to not kick as much (which was always the weakest part of my technique).  Is there any point to besides only focusing on my arm technique? My arm technique is pretty solid.
3. Is it fine that I'm skipping out on Butterfly
4. What is your favourite shampoo, conditioner, leave in mask, hair oil to save your hair.

Every stroke, every lap, every kick felt awful and slow. I made it 500yds total and just stopped. Asked myself why the hell am I doing this?  Nobody else I know is putting themselves through this shit.  Got out of the pool, sat in the hot tub and hated myself for giving up.

Initially I was only able to do 3-400 yards per practice, eventually working my way up to about 4000 yards per day.However, I noticed that my speed was not improving. I was able to increase the distance of my swims, but I had minimal speed.

Two weeks ago I started to shift the way I swam.

Swimming routine is now as follows:

Three days a weeks3 rounds of the following:1 x 25 fastswim easy (75)1 x 50 fastswim easy (100)First round swim, second round with paddles, third round with fins (swimming butterfly)

Four days a week:8 x 25s with 25 lbs weight vest 25 yards with paddles4 x 75s kick for time (easy 125 or so swimming between)10 x 25s swimming with resistance cord1 x 75 fast freestyle

So far I've been able to push a 24+ 50 freestyle, 39+ 75 freestyle in my second week training.

The other thing I've noticed is that I'm completely exhausted after the swims.Totally different feeling after a fast 50 than swimming multiple 250s or other long distance sets.I'm noticing a rapid increase in speed after doing minimal distance but focusing on close to 100% effort on each swim.

I'm looking for any additional ideas to drop time in the 25s and 50s.

Can find lots on 1km target speeds for just freestyle, but struggling for that length in backstroke - I was hoping to just pick a midpoint between times for each as a rudimentary personal goal. Does anyone have any advice, or reference for 500m or 1km backstroke times? 

For reference, today I swam 1100m in 28.5mins (550 in each alternating every 4 laps - it was a 27.5m pool so did 40 laps thinking that was 1km). I‚Äôm pretty proud of this given both my poor fitness levels & health stuff, but keen to set myself goals to improve!!",Swimming

We've been working together for 2 months and at our first lesson together I originally explained to her that a kickboard is for training and a tool to learn how to swim. She accepted my explanation and was willing to give my lesson plan a try.

We started with breath control and bobs by the wall, progressed to kicks on the wall, progressed to glides from the wall to me (1 yard away) with kicks, and I started introducing streamline to improve her alignment. We also tried having her glide to the wall (1 yard away).

Since the new year, she's missed two classes and hasn't been as consistent so her anxiety has spiked. In our most recent class, she came in insisting she'd only swim with a kickboard and I don't know where to go from here.... she willing to use a dumbbell. In her words she's not willing to stop using any device until she's 100% comfortable.

From my understanding, she's only learning how to kick with a kickboard not how to swim. Either way some practice is better than none, but any ideas on where to go from here? 

My thoughts are have her go from kickboard>dumbbell>noodle, and have her start practicing frontcrawl pulls with the dumbbell. Any advice, personal stories, insight is appreciated.

Edit: thanks for the advice! The game plan since my swimmer will only use kickboard/dumbbells and is not yet ready to add  pulls will be  (1) front floats while holding the wall (2) breath work (3) kicks with a device and (4) introducing fins depending on her comfort.",Swimming

I just wanted to ask if anyone is experiencing the same.

In August 2023, I decided to pursue one of life's greatest skills, which is learning to swim. I have just realised that I have been missing out a lot! Initially, I had a phobia of sticking my head under water. However, I gradually overcame it. Till this point, I think I am the master of the shallow end ‚Äì I am 6 feet, 2 inches tall; not that height has anything to do with how well you can swim, I hope.

My next move is to master the deep end by the end of May. Wish me luck. I swam a few times to the deep end, with two swimming instructors providing me with the guard of honour. I have not gathered the confidence to make that journey alone. Subconsciously, I see that the line between the deep and the shallow end is the valley of death. So I do not mess with that. Till then, I am happy to be Michael Helps rather than Michael Phelps for now.

A few observations I‚Äôve noticed are that, whenever I am in the pool, I am free. I feel fresh, happy, and complete. Because of this, I have not missed a single lesson. I have also always suffered from migraines, but I have only noticed a few attacks lately. All in all, I just feel better mentally and physically. Why is that thought?¬†",Swimming

I'm just getting back into the pool after stopping for a few years. I'm in my late 20s and used to train as a kid. Have no memory of what I was actually doing back then with a coach. Just that I was always swimming.

Currently (after 3-5 sessions) swimming at 1:53/100m over 1k. 100m record is 1:20, so far. Freestyle.

Atm I'm only swimming FS and doing 1km swims. I'll push up to 1.5km eventually. Not sure what the best strategy is here.

My arms and legs get stiff quite quickly. My arms feel weak. I don't do any other forms of exercise but I'm considering strength training. My freestyle technique uses very little kick. I have no ability to keep momentum on turns (never learned or was taught this for some reason) so I stop and push (I lose LOTS of time in 25m pools vs 50m pools).

I like to constantly improve on my times so I'm looking for advice here.

I've watched some YouTube tutorials on breathing techniques and took one class with an instructor who gave me some drills with a floating board and fins, and basicly told me to practice them.  


I've been practicing with fins and focusing on one-sided breathing exercises, which seem to help me swim more thoughtfully and breathe easier. However, I'm unsure if I'm missing any crucial drills that encompass the fundamental movements of freestyle swimming. My routine includes swimming 50-100 meters using drills, mainly one-sided breathing, followed by regular swimming with fins, and concluding with a couple of 25-meter freestyle laps.  


Is there a 'drill set' recommended for beginners? And how should I track my progress, by distance or speed? any recommended goals or checks to see that I'm on track?

Until recently, I decided to swim for my school to get out of going to an away match for another sport :). 
Before the meet, I watched a TON of yt videos about different stroke techniques. On the day of the meet, I decided to test out two different techniques for the 50m Freestyle:

‚Ä¢ Windmill- but arms slightly bent- very shoulder and hip driven- Very high tempo- exhausting -28.9 s


‚Ä¢ Traditional- idk what else to call it but I grew up on it. The classic really bent elbow over the water, and I made sure to have a really high elbow under the water (like I had a yoga ball between my arms, shoulder and my chest)- Medium to low tempo- small time increments of just gliding. -not tiring at all.
29.1 s

I've been teaching kids 18 mo - 10 years old how to swim for 2 years now and I have to say I absolutely love it. It can be draining of course but what job isn't? Anyways, my skin always gets pretty bad when I work when it gets cooler, particularly my face. I started getting chlorine rash at the end of our Fall session but it healed over our holiday break. However, we're back in session and this winter has been even worse than before. Even with using shea butter religiously before I get in the water and rinsing off every time I'm out of the water for longer than 20 minutes, I'm getting chlorine rash on my arms and legs. My face is horribly dry and damaged to the point that I had to go to the dermatologist and get a prescription moisturizer. 
I know the best solution is staying out of water to let everything actually heal but that's obviously not an option right now. 
Luckily I'm able to get by on babysitting throughout the summer, but I have to be in the water all throughout May until the spring session ends.

- **Flying** (conquered last summer and have flown four times since. I have more flights scheduled this year and can‚Äôt WAIT. Im obsessed now and know more about airplanes than the frequent flyers in my family)

- **Snakes** - my only plan is to touch one, one day. That‚Äôs it!

- **Swimming** - I was tossed in a pool as a kid and lost all control because it was unexpected. 

I was strangled and inhaled water and could not catch my breath while the adult who did it laughed and did not help. I worked out the situation myself and left the pool for good that day.

I have only visited water that is below the waist and have not been submerged since that day. I have been looking at courses in my town and am excited to book. 

Generational fear is real. My mom watched her brother almost drown which made her mom scared to expose her 7 kids to water. Then I grew up not  allowed to get near water, unless it was in my mom‚Äôs friend‚Äôs pool, who actually lifted me above her head and tossed me in - that‚Äôs when I experienced what I did. And now, I have two girls and always let them go *near* the water at the beach but not *in* the water to far. 

I am planning to schedule lessons for all 3 of us. 

What are the recommended weeks to feel comfortable swimming without a coach or anyone around? **We aren‚Äôt scared of pools or getting in - we are scared to go under and actually lift our feet off the ground**.

1821,1706701975.0,Do you want to learn how to be a great swimmer in no time at all?,"Maybe you started swimming for new year‚Äôs resolution, and you still can‚Äôt get to 300m.

Maybe you signed up to that 5k challenge a bit too soon and now you‚Äôre starting to panic.

Maybe you‚Äôre wondering if there‚Äôs a magic solution to your problem.

Well, I‚Äôve got some great news for you! There‚Äôs not.

I‚Äôm being serious, this is great news.

If you want to swim for the long term, rushing things is a great way to give up quickly. 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts over the past month focussed around ‚Äúit‚Äôs been a month, why aren‚Äôt I good yet‚Äù or ‚Äúcan I swim 10k next month if I start training now?‚Äù

Most people aren‚Äôt naturally gifted swimmers, it takes time, patience and motivation to learn. That is normal and that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs also great fun learning how to swim, and a mentally and physically rewarding exercise too.

I‚Äôm a confident swimmer, and I used to do competitions for our high school team. You know how I got to that level? Because my parents made me swim go to swim lessons from the age of 5.

I also took a big break from swimming. I‚Äôm talking like 20 years! I used to run, but after a really bad bike accident I couldn‚Äôt exercise for about a year. As I had injured my knees badly in the crash I thought I‚Äôd go back to swimming. 

When I got back in the pool, I sucked!!! Sure, I knew some basic stuff, but I was slow, had forgotten techniques, and would get out of breath fast.

I had to look at what I could do. I increased by roughly 10% (rounded up to the nearest length) each week. I watched videos about improving technique on a regular basis. It took a couple of months before I could swim 2km and I felt exhausted afterwards. Once I could swim 2km confidently I start incorporating different workouts such as drills, distance and speed swims into my routine to help build confidence in the pool.

It's now just under a year since I first started swimming again. I swim around 10km per week over 4 sessions, have increased my front crawl/freestyle pace to 01:30 per 100m from 02:30 per 100, and I‚Äôm losing weight and building muscle GRADUALLY. I‚Äôve even signed up to do a swimming marathon in March! Here‚Äôs my tips if you want to love swimming and be good at it:

1. Instead of getting frustrated by looking at what you can‚Äôt do, reward yourself by focussing on what you can do and try and improve slowly. You swam you first 100m today? That‚Äôs great!

2. Trying to rush things isn‚Äôt fun. It can and up being demotivating. You can burn out because you don‚Äôt have the skills, strength, and resilience to swim that fast or that distance yet. Worst of all you can injure yourself.

3. Set realistic goals, not some kind of marathon for next month. Maybe do a Marathon in 6 months or a year. 

4. Don‚Äôt be afraid to go in a slower lane. It‚Äôs better to learn the technique properly at a pace that‚Äôs right for you than trying to push your speed, being sloppy and risking injury. I always swim freestyle in fast because I have a strong technique and breaststroke in medium because my technique needs improving. Plus swimming in the wrong speed lane is not only annoying for you, but it‚Äôs annoying for everyone else too. For the love of God, leave your ego outside of the pool PLEASE

5. On a similar note, pool politeness goes a long way. Most pools now have guides on the walls on how to make swimming a pleasant experience for everyone (aka rules on how to behave). Follow these and your swim will be a lot more pleasant. Trust me on this.

6. Watch videos regularly to improve your technique. Youtube has everything covered from breathing, to basic techniques to expert. Also watch a few different swimmers talk about technique. Everyone has slight variations, some might work for you you, some might not, but it‚Äôs fun to try!

7. Get lessons. If you can‚Äôt afford them (like me), ask a friend who is good at swimming to give you some feedback on your technique. Feedback from others is solid gold when it comes to swimming.

8. I didn‚Äôt start losing weight from swimming until I could swim at least 2km every session. I couldn‚Äôt swim 2km every session until about 3-4 months after I started. Even though I have a extra pounds on me, my main goal with swimming is overall physical and mental fitness, not losing weight. Most people find it‚Äôs a pretty slow way of losing weight. If that is your goal and you really don‚Äôt want to diet, I would recommend the treadmill instead.

9. Don‚Äôt expect magic overnight and focus on enjoying swimming! It‚Äôs a great sport!

I find being in the water very freeing, and swimming is a very mindful process. I can switch off my thoughts and just focus on my whole body and my breathing for the next hour. I‚Äôm so much happier when I‚Äôm swimming regularly than when I‚Äôm not. I can challenge yourself on my own terms. For every grumpy swimmer, there‚Äôs 10 nice swimmers who are really encouraging and happy to give good feedback. It‚Äôs a great community and if you are really stumped, you can always come here. Have fun.

1839,1706647076.0,"Speed loss, fatigue and sinking midsection and not being able to get a breath","So I've been swimming on and off for years now but pretty much with a major case of fuckaround-itis. I wish to get serious about it now. However, I have a few issues. Backround: 5'7"" M and 145 lbs so fairly lean.

My first 50 always starts out awesome. Form feels solid, been told it looks solid, no issues getting a breath. Then after 100 yards or so, my form progressively falls apart, i slow significantly and I sink...bad. Getting a breath is insanely difficult because my mid section sinks and always feels like a lot of pressure in my diaphragm, so to speak. Like when I take a breath and put my face back in the water, pretty much my whole body goes underwater too. I have been lifting for the last 6 months, but we all know that swimming is far different than lifting. So I pretty much discount that training towards any swimming contributions.

Now, I have no doubt my form could improve but...I'm starting to think this issue is simply the fact that my swimming muscles are weak/not used to being under such high demand with less oxygen. In the last week of swimming everyday, it already feels a little bit easier to complete a 100 with halfway decent form. But my midsection sinks so incredibly bad despite a conscious effort to keep it tight and keep my body in line. I do also stare at the bottom of the pool when swimming. My head position is in line with my body as I've been told. But it feels like someone strapped a 10lb brick to my pelvis...

I know how to breath and am aware of the ""air pocket"". I keep one goggle in the water and tilt my chin to my shoulder and I often end up taking in more chlorine than is probably safe lol. Although today, I did just discover the ""moving your mouth to the side of your face"" movement. Feels super awkward but seemed to help during my last 100.

Does this sound like something that will improve with practice as my endurance goes up? It definitely feels like form break down and loss of momentum from fatigue causing these issues.

I feel like a seizing flounder trying to get a breath and my co-workers (I work at a pool) don't seem to see what I'm talking about with my sinking when trying to breath.

\-Square bracket italicized *\[ \]* are optional sets that were not part of the original workout.

\-DPS = (Distance Per Stroke) Maximize the distance traveled for each stroke while minimizing the total number of strokes to complete the distance

\-Descend = Maintain a given pace within the distance, but get **faster** as you work through the set (descend in time/pace)

\-Fast in the Black = Fast speed in the solid colored section of your pools lane lines between the flags and wall, then smooth/moderate outside of that between the sets of flags. Our pools lane lines alternate red/black with black being the 5m lead in color to the wall, hence fast the black. 

\-Build = Start slow then get faster within the given distance

I (27F) swam competitively from the age of 12 to 18. I was able to learn good technique and proper etiquette for lap swimming from my years participating in my local swim team. As a 27 year old I decided to restart swimming as it was always a good workout and something I really enjoyed. I‚Äôve been swimming 3-4x/week for a few months at my local Y. The other members swimming are usually older men/women and I am a good bit faster than them. I make a point to reserve a lane, making sure that I will only ever have to split a lane with one person so I won‚Äôt be in their way. I always stick to my side, try to pass by quickly if needed, always ask before joining the lane, and just do my thing. At this Y there are only ‚Äúreserved lanes‚Äù or ‚Äúdrop in‚Äù lanes- not fast or slow. 

 As a overthinking-people pleaser I tend to get paranoid that I‚Äôm upsetting the people I swim with. There have been occasions where the (usually men) will give me what I think are dirty looks or talk to the lifeguard while pointing in my direction. The only thing I can think that I am doing wrong would be flip turning while they are resting at the wall. I‚Äôve done a lot of research that says that it‚Äôs not an issue, but I want to ask: Am I the asshole for this? In my defense, they are resting at the wall a good bit and I am very good at staying in my lane while flip turning. I am probably overthinking it but I‚Äôd love to hear what you think.

1875,1706545077.0,Pain in the muscles around my shoulder blades,"TL;DR I recently started swimming again and it severely aggravated muscle pain I feel in my back from my otherwise sedentary lifestyle. Anyone else deal with this before?

Not sure if this is entirely swimming related but figured I'd reach out to this community and see if anyone has experienced something similar. 

I tend to hold my stress in my shoulders, specifically in the muscles around my shoulder blades. This is more than likely due to the fact I work in a traditional office environment and over the years I've taken steps to mitigate the issues: ergonomic workspace setup, more frequent standing/walking brakes away from my desk, standing desk, kneeling chair, frequent back massages, etc.

These steps have helped me manage my discomfort over the years but here comes the swimming part. In the last three months or so I've taken up swimming. I started out very easy and am doing about 20 laps 3 times a week. I'm a former triathlete, and the muscle memory for swimming returned pretty quickly and I've found it really enjoyable. I'm not training for anything at the moment, just generally trying to stay fit and healthy. 

Unfortunately the pain in my shoulders has exploded. There's been no other lifestyle changes, no additional stress at work so far as I can tell, so all I can think is it must be the swimming causing the issues. The pain has also migrated from the muscles between the shoulder blades to the area under the shoulder blades and is mostly symmetrical, though maybe a little worse on the right side (I'm right handed).

Notes for this set:

\-Parenthesis ( ) are optional modifiers to the number, or distance, in the set. For example, columns 3-4 will do 2x200 Free-Descend instead of 3, or column 5 will do 1x50 Easy instead of a 100.

\-Square bracket italicized *\[ \]* are optional sets that were not part of the original workout.

\-Balance Drill = Push off the wall and kick on your side. The arm lower in the water should be straight out in front of you in a streamline-like position. Your other arm should be at or above the surface of the water at your side as though it's in a pocket. Keep your face looking at the bottom of the pool turning to breath as necessary. Switch sides halfway though the distance or on the next set, whichever makes sense.

\-8 Kick Sideline = Start off the same as the balance drill. After 6-8 kicks take 1 stroke. 6-8 more strokes then another stroke. Wash, rinse, repeat.

\-Triple Switch = Start off the same as the balance drill. After 6-8 kicks take 3 strokes, 6-8 more kicks, then 3 more strokes. Wash, rinse, repeat.

\-Build = Start slow then get faster within the given distance

\-Descend = Maintain a given pace within the distance, but get **faster** as you work through the set (descend in time/pace)

\-Strong = Faster than moderate, slower than fast

I just got my first swimming headphones. I'm missing the option to skip back end forth in long podcasts, so I wrote a short script which splits a long mp3 file into many parts of fixed length. Now I can use the next/previous track option to skip ahead/back by a few minutes.

In case anyone is interested, I made the tool available online. Completely free, no strings attached. I didn't invest any time into making it pretty or robust, so it might crash on you.

I don't ask for your email or any other data. I hope this doesn't break any rules.

Just select your mp3 and enter the length of the individual parts of the resulting mp3s. A one hour podcast and 5 minutes will result in 12 parts of 5 minutes.

If you upload anything other than an mp3 file, you will get a cryptic error message.

You can use it here: [http://49.13.93.157/](http://49.13.93.157/)

I was thrilled to swim my first pool race in fifty years in 2023.  It has been a long road back.

I  was a competitive swimmer through high school and swam off-and-on for many years, occasionally getting in shape enough for an open water event.

A freak injury in 2000  left me disabled, in terrible pain, and unable to swim for almost twenty years.  I tore many of the muscles attached to my shoulder blade resulting in intractable deep muscle spasms,  displacement of the shoulder blade,  and pain beyond words.  Other muscles got overworked and spasmed trying to compensate.  In time, I developed Complex Regional Pain Syndrome - a terrible type of nerve pain.  I was a mess - spending most of my time curled up on a heated water bed drugged from the meds despite trying everything that I or my doctors could come up with - from acupuncture to magnetic brain stimulation.

In 2015, I went to my local yoga studio, found a practice that I could tolerate, and began to make slow improvements. My pain went down, my function improved, and I tossed the meds.   Eventually, I was able to do a very limited amount of swimming with a pull buoy,  but I was never able to strengthen my shoulder/back sufficiently to swim without pain despite many attempts at physical rehab.  I gave up on swimming again.

Then COVID stepped in.  During lockdown, a teacher/mentor posed the question; ""What have you given up on""?  I resolved instantly to try again.  Due to the lockdown, I turned to the web for guidance as I did not want to do in-person rehab.  I stumbled upon a new approach, and by the time the pool reopened,  I was strong enough to swim without pain. I was S-L-O-W but oh so happy to be swimming without pain.

Since then, I have been swimming regularly and joyfully, cautiously increasing yardage.  It has been a tremendous boost in so many ways.  I even relapsed (re-laps-ed) to competitive swimming last year.

I am now training for the 1650 at the upcoming Master's regional championship and thoroughly enjoying every lap even those last repeats when everything hurts.

1905,1706454779.0,Lack of lane lines at the YMCA,"Recently I've started to get back into swimming shape and I'm lucky that the YMCA is only 5 minutes from my house

However, I've had issues with how they set up the pool for lap swim. It's only a 6 lane pool so it can fill up quickly, but what troubles me is that they really don't bother putting lane lines in.

The typical setup is:
4 lanes just open, no lane lines
2 lanes sectioned off for open/family swim.

Its a bit chaotic, and while most use the lap section purely for walk/swimming, they typically won't share a ""lane"" making it hard for me to fit in.

Backstroke also feels irresponsible to do in this scenario.

It is a workout that the body enjoys doing, embraces it, and quite surpringly even gets a lot out of it. It is a workout that elicits smiles amongst athletes, adolescents or young adults, in particular.

Categorically speaking, given the above I understand people derive a lot of ""fun"" doing volume/anerobically intense workouts. But those are not the workouts I am talking about.
