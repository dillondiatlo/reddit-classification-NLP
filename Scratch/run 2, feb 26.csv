### Training


I only just got serious about running last year after having just done it every once in a while as a quick workout. I started out just running 3mi 3 days a week. After I selected a race, I got a Garmin because I like data and am horrible at pacing myself. I started with the Hansons beginner half plan. THAT was an error. I don't know if the mileage increase was too much but I started experiencing knee and IT band pain. I hit pause on that and started a 17 week training program on my Garmin, with a goal of 2:15. It was a 4 day a week plan.  I also incorporated strength training 2-3x a week.


I know reviews are mixed when it comes to the Garmin plans, but honestly I loved it. My watch yelled at me when I was too fast or too slow! Pacing was calculated for me based on a test run. It was great. Then I injured a muscle in my calf doing some unknown nonsense and had to take two weeks off. Not Ideal but I hopped right back in and continued on, generally feeling good during speed workouts and long runs. I didn't miss a day for the next 12 ish weeks.


Unfortunately, at the beginning of my taper, I re-injured my calf doing an excessive number of lunges during strength training. Took a week off. Went for an easy run to gauge my recovery. Stepped in a pothole because I run at night and the city is garbage. Twisted my ankle, thought it was ok, jogged home. NOT OK. I ended up wearing a brace for a while. I optimistically started carb-loading three days before just in case my ankle was ok in time. Did a nice easy run with the brace on Thursday to see if I would even be able to do the race. It went shockingly well! Ran a 30 min shake-out on Saturday, ate my face off, and went to bed later than I wanted.

### Pre-race


Woke up at 5:55 because that extra 5mins really made the difference. Had two gluten free toaster waffles (celiac), almond butter, honey, a banana, and an electrolyte drink that my MIL offloaded on me because it is disgusting. Raspberry salt. Blech.


Checked the weather: freezing, dressed, and did some foam rolling before heading to shirt pickup. I considered the 20ish min. walk my warmup and did some dynamic stretching once I got to the start. My photographer husband very enthusiastically brought his giant camera and took some pictures of me looking dumb swinging my legs around.


Got in the corral, freezing, and waited the 10 minutes for the race to start. Planning for an even split with 10ish min miles.

### Race


The first mile was a little nerve wracking because of my ankle, but the brace kept me toasty and stable. After mile 2 I realized my watch was off by maybe .15 miles, so I decided to pick up the pace a bit. Kept fueling every 3 miles. 


I don't know what happened at mile 5 but apparently I just wanted to book it. I realized I was feeling better than anticipated so I tried to maintain around a 9:30-9:40 pace for the next few miles, and aimed to pick it up around mile 11/12. Forget about that even split, apparently. 


Around mile 7 though, my legs got ROUGH. I had energy but they were just heavy and gross, so keeping pace was a struggle. I made it to 11 and figured either I go for it, or regret not doing the most I could, so I picked up the pace. At 12 it felt like I was booking it because it was uphill, but I was not. I went all out for the last 200 yards though. Started struggling to breathe - not ideal. Just could not pull in air, no idea what happened. New fun thing! But sprinted across the finish, grabbed a medal and heat blanket, couldn't figure out how to open the heat blanket, threw the heat blanket away. 


As you saw above, pacing consistency is not my thing.

### Post-race


My husband had miscalculated my mileage and had to sprint from the east side of the park, I was honestly very impressed with his time. He arrived just in time to see me cross the finish line and we met up so I could get into those toasty toasty sweats and have a protein shake and some electrolytes.


My legs died today. They felt like GARBAGE. Achy achy garbage. I chose to not sit down for fear of becoming one with the freezing ground. We walked over to Modern Bread and Bagel (shout out!) 15 blocks away. I honestly think this helped with my, admittedly ongoing, recovery. Ate a delicious bagel and latke tots and got a gosh darn bus home because like heck was I walking all the way across the park.


One hot shower, roll out session, and nap, later, and here I am. Refusing to get out of bed and messing around on reddit instead of being a productive member of society. Race recovery risotto for dinner!


Thanks for reading my nonsense y'all!

| 13 | 7:26
| 0.28 | 1:58 (picked up a little extra distance weaving around and whatnot)

### Training
Loosely followed a 12 week 4 day a week 2 hour half marathon plan but dropped one of the weekly short easy runs because I climb 3 days a week and I didn't want to give up a day of climbing to double up (running is more of a side thing). One short easy run, one interval/speed workout, one long slow run.

Longest run was 12 miles two weeks before the race.

### Pre-race
Was feeling nervous going into the race. I had some aches and pains starting to show up in my arches and ankles in the month leading up to the race and my last 12 mile training run was a grind for the last few miles (from general fatigue more than joint pain specifically, it was an unusually warm day that day). I also hadn't done a race this early (6am start, 4am wake up) so I wasnt sure exactly how that would affect my energy.

I was confident I'd finish but I wanted to go sub 2 which would require running faster than all my training runs.

### Race
Got up at 4am, had coffee, a PBJ and some electrolytes. Got things moving, made it to the race venue nice and early, used the restroom again and headed to the corral with plenty of time to question my life choices.

This was my first half and my first race with pacers so it was a new experience to have such a visible and immediate source of feedback on pace. My plan was just to stick with the 2 hour pacer and see what happened. I quite enjoyed not having to constantly check my watch to make sure I was on pace, shout out to those guys (and gals and nonbinary pals)

A nice dark cool start for the first hour before the sun came up. Despite going before heading to the staring line I had to pee again and peeled off around mile 4 to hit the portajohn. Found my pacer again and got back on track (definitely worth the time penalty). 

You come out of a residential area onto the waterfront around mile 5 or 6 and it's beautiful to run by the bay as the sun is rising. Thankfully the temperatures stayed mild even once the sun made it's entrance. 

Usually in my training runs  I'd start to crap out around mile 9 but I was feeling great by this point in the race so I decided to open up on the pace since it seemed like I might have a shot to finish in 2 hours per the overall race clock rather than just my chip time. Things felt great all the way up to the finish line where I finished with the clock at 2:00:20 and my chip time at 1:56:29

Somehow I managed to PR my 10k, 5k, and mile times during the race. I'm still relatively new to running so I don't have a ton of races under my belt and only raced one 10k and 5k each during my lead up to this so there was definitely room to improve on those times but I'm still very happy with how it turned out. I don't think it could have gone any better.


### Post-race
Great race, great course, great times. Will celebrate with beer and other recreational goods and hopefully a nap (not necessarily in that order). 

A marathon is probably not in my future at least for the foreseeable time horizon. My goal is to do a couple fun runs in the next month or two (there's a 10k that goes across one of Tampa bays bridges as well as a mud race that I have my eyes on) and then just try to hold onto as much progress I can when the 1-2 punch of brutal heat and daily rain comes in the summertime. Once fall starts to roll back around maybe we'll think about another half.

11,1708800889.0,"Ladies, is it ok for a guy to use you as a pacer?","I ran a half marathon this morning at a US Roadrunners event. Most people run the 5k or 10k and the HM crowd is usually very small. Today, apparently there were 10 people running it. It’s a little out and back course that requires 4 laps to hit 13.1 miles. I didn’t have any real goal in mind this morning, I just wanted to run and get an idea of where I’m at after a few months of interupted running. Long story short, when the race started, I quickly progressed to the front of the pack and there were only a few people in front of me. The HM turnaround is a little after the 5/10k so I found out that the lady in front of me was also running the HM. She had set a solid pace and I ended up using her to push myself. I basically tailed her the whole race, leaving a 10-20 meter gap between us. As we neared the finish line on the last lap, I caught up and finished right on her heels. I wanted to finish strong but I didn’t want to pass her since she had set the pace the entire run. 

When we finished, we congregated each other and chatted for a bit. She told me that knowing I was keeping up with her had pushed her to keep up the pace and she was really thankful. I told her that she was the one forcing me to push, not the other way around. Haha. So it was a great run but the whole time, I was thinking about an Instagram post I saw a professional female runner post. In a nutshell, she told guys that she (and other women) aren’t personal pacers and being a female and having a guy following you can be uncomfortable. I understand that as much as I can being a guy and that was why I tried to keep a gap between me and the lady setting the pace. 

So my question is, for the female runners out there, would you have felt uncomfortable if you were the woman at the race this morning? I’m thinking it’s maybe different in a race setting than if we were just out running casually somewhere. I’m curious as to people’s thoughts because I have no interest in making a fellow runner uncomfortable and while the lady this morning was thankful for me helping her to keep the pace, I didn’t know that until after we finished.

*Edit: just for clarity, the instagram runner I’m referring to was talking about being used as a pacer on a training run, not in a race which I think is very different and totally understandable. As the “race” I ran was just a monthly US Roadrunner event and not an official race, I thought the question was worth asking. If it was an official race, I think it’s totally fine but as it was just a small (less than 200 people) event and the results were meaningless, I thought I’d ask. I’ve always run solo so these monthly events are the only times I’ve run with other people and yesterday was the first time I’ve used another runner to push myself.",running
12,1708805246.0,How to be kinder to yourself as a beginner runner?,"Hey all, I just started running like 3 months ago. I think I’ve been progressing as I can run longer distances without my form breaking down as much, or having better energy for longer distance runs, but having said that, I feel like I’m too harsh on myself. When I see my stats on Strava after a long run, I’ll often say to myself in my head “you’re such a loser”, “such an idiot, people out there doing marathons and 9min mile”, “but you can’t even do something simple”, like I will constantly berate myself even tho I would never say this to someone else who’s new to running. Wondering how to be kinder to myself and not be obsessed with noticeable progress in every run. 



Edit: thanks for the supportive comments. Just some context, I’ve never been a runner. Was very average at gym class, never great. Also, I feel like no one in my family, or in my family’s history has been athletic, and it doesn’t help that I’m from a gene pool that’s generally stereotyped as being non-athletic by most of the world.

I signed up to run the Disney Princess Half Marathon with one of my best friends. She is super into the Disney races, and this will be her 10th year doing it. This is my 3rd half-marathon. 

I'm a faster runner than her, but she had mentioned she wanted PR this year to complete one of her 30-before-30 goals (we're 29 years old). I was excited about this, and I have been training.

She is very set on running races TOGETHER, the entire time. Every race we've done together we cross the finish line holding hands. It's fun and very bonding, but she slows me down. It can be frustrating considering how much these races cost and how the Disney races don't come around that often. 

I have been friends with her for over 10 years, and I know in the past a friend ""took off on her"" and she held resentment towards this other girl for it, for years. 

The race is two days away- and she communicated with me that she has an ankle injury. She no longer thinks WE can ""run run"" this race. She will probably want to walk a lot more than I will. 

Should I tell her I want to run at my own pace? We're having a sleepover and dressing up for this so I'm concerned she's going to react very poorly to this suggestion.

Background

I am 18 male and weigh around 175 lbs. I ran cross country and track all 4 years of high school, ending with mediocre PR's of 18:45 for the 5k and 5:05 in the mile. Unfortunately, due to living in a rural area, my cross country and track coach was the JV girls' basketball coach who had no knowledge about the sport at all. Due to this in cross country season my training consisted of essentially running 3 miles hard Monday through Friday. Training for track wasn't much different as she had me doing either 2-mile repeats or 400-meter repeats five days a week. My highest mileage week was 15 miles. As you can probably tell this led to a very injury riddled career. After graduating high school, I met some of the cross-country runners at my college. When they heard about my training in high school, they encouraged me to start running again and see if I improve with proper training.

Training

As soon as winter break started, I decided to take their advice and started my training, running a solo mile time trial in 6:13. I took two weeks just to get myself into decent shape, and started up a plan I found on the internet on January 1st. This plan had me running 3-4 miles at an easy pace 4 days a week, with 2 workouts, and a long run on Sundays. This made running so much more fun that in high school and I started to actually enjoy running. About 3 weeks in, the plan had me run a time trial 800, which I finished in 2:39. 2 weeks later, I did a 1200 time trial which was completed in 4:08. 2 days later, I ran possibly my best workout ever: 8 x 400 with 2 minutes rest in 77-75-75-73-73-74-79-81. This really boosted my confidence, because I never got close to these splits in high school. I ended up running around 30 miles a week the last month of training, and never got an injury or even felt close to one!! You can see all my training at my Strava: https://www.strava.com/athletes/116210504/training/log

Pre-race

I slept great the day before the race and got a fitful 8 hours. I made sure to drink a good amount of water throughout the day especially because this was the first day of 75+ degrees this year. I stretched and warmed up with an easy mile beforehand.

Race

At around 8:30 I started my race alone. I felt good after one lap and split a 75. In laps 2 and 3 I felt as if I kept the same pace from lap 1, but I was really struggling. I split 84 and 83 for these laps respectively Lap 4 I just went all out finishing with an 80 final split and a 5:22.

Post-race/Next Steps

In retrospect I probably took it out too fast trying to break my PR, (which by the way had a 69 first split lol) and then really couldn't hold on especially because I was alone and not in an actual race. I still do think I could run close to sub 5:00 in a real race considering I am very competitive and have a history of running much better with competition. Unfortunately, there's not much of a running community near me and there are virtually no races at all, much less just a 1-mile race. I don't really know where to go from here as my friends on my college's team run 4:20-4:30, and my college doesn't have a club team that could help me get into an actual race. I do think I need to get better at longer distances, as the paces that I should be able to run a tempo at are all out efforts and I can't run 1 mile at what I should be able to run an all out 5k at. Maybe I'll do that, but I'm very much open to tips or advice on what I should do.",running

23,1708620959.0,Finding the shoe that feels right?,"What in particular do you look for in a running shoe? I’ll see that several different brands will have a variety of different shoes with similar descriptions, but at different price ranges. 

Do you purchase with price in mind or perceived value provided by the more expensive shoe?  

I currently have three different pair of running shoes. The most comfortable pair of shoe that I wear tend to be a trail running shoe. Friends who are experience runners will say that in the long run, trail running shoes don’t protect your knees very well. 

If one shoe causes less foot pain? Would that not be better for the long run? How long does it take to get used to a pair of running shoes? Am I wearing my running shoes wrong when they cause me pain?

27,1708647787.0,"A Guide: Budget/Homemade Running Nutrition (gels, hydrogels, electrolytes, & recovery)","Hi All,

I wanted to share some information on running nutrition. I have spent way too many hours googling this stuff and I think it can help the community save some money, as it has for me. I haven't been seriously running for long. I am SO far from elite. I do have a bit of a background in the chemical and food industry, so a lot of this was easy to make sense of. I thought I would compile some of the information I have so there is a centralized place to find it. If anyone has better recipes, better ideas, or anything to add - please feel free to.

These recipes could/would replace products like Maurten 320, Gu, Tailwind, Skratch, electrolytes, and post run recovery drinks. The following are just guides and can be modified to your desired sources of carbs, electrolytes, activity, and uses.

I source all the ingredients through amazon. I prefer the brands Pure & Bulk Supplements. Their prices seem to be good, and shipping is prompt.

&#x200B;

**Carbs**

This carb recipe is what I use. It's pretty much an exact replica of Maurten 320. Someone smarter than me designed it so I feel fine with it. If you desire a hydrogel type drink, then just mix 80g of it with 500ml of water and you will have Maurten 320. The hydrogel is backed by science, Joshua Rowe prior to his employment at Maurten tested this idea in a study and did prove its effectiveness. Other companies have claims against this actually having any improvement in carb uptake. I figure it can't hurt, so I include the gelling components. Additionally, I use this same base as a gel. So one carb mix allows me to decide what I want to use depending on the application/workout. I use a maltodextrin and fructose blend, because the maltodextrin isn't very sweet. Its palatable without being overly sweet. If you want to be even more cost effective, use straight up table sugar. It's a 1:1 ratio, versus a 1:0.8, so it would perform almost identically. You can also go 2:1 if you want even less sweetness by having a reduced fructose amount. Maltodextrin is super cheap so that could be a way you to stretch your fructose longer if desired. I don't include electrolytes, but if you want you can. The electrolyte recipe further down this post can definitely be added to this if you like it combined. I do not add any flavoring, but if you want you can add whatever you like.

The recipe:

Single Maurten 320

* 48g Maltodextrin
* 32g Fructose
* 1.25g Pectin
* 1g Sodium Alginate

Below is the recipe of Maurten 320 scaled up 10x. Feel free to adjust quantities to fit your needs. I like a 10x batch in a big zip lock to use as needed. If you want, you can even do 20x, etc.

10x Maurten 320

* 480g Maltodextrin
* 320g Fructose
* 12.5g Pectin
* 10g Sodium Alginate

When making a gel, take your total desired volume and use 60% carbs + 40% water. Add boiling water and it will dissolve fairly quickly. Maltodextrin takes the longest. The consistency is thick enough that it doesn't shoot out of your preferred pouch uncontrollably but also is easy enough to drink & swallow. For the 150ml pouches I do 120g carbs + 80g water in a bowl. Mix with a hand mixer and then dump into a pouch. Filled to the fill line results in about 105g of carbs per pouch, so two pouches could easily fuel an entire marathon. Typically, I use these [reusable children's food pouches](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Modern-Reusable-Food-Pouches/dp/B08SRSWFY6/ref=sr\_1\_1?crid=37J2J5RL9Y5RJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.bTt4-fkUYWw7NM9Y8YVRco2EdvSKDBbGhQ1UkSwF8Bb9rnevEz02y6zY0RGA8au35PRJCLcSX6wUW9rrA-3qwHhbb5GPNLKe6LGParjW6p-KkaAp\_vsmuF8PhDyEuEd3S8qWdTQaadhpigY721Pdyk\_-SG2xtZLvAqFIl13xqGyCa7yyePtDqxJhQPRp8hakwZOEv5PQfWg53qaoIrapnna6PMWVK1J5XiJDxVDTexHr4ouALl\_1htt4gwUOYWYIdili4KK0yCb7Oz7qCI36fPcyPYGSSoXHN2E9wSPaNAI.o2RowZ4o9FZBcSdUjh4VSw-ylCG9wd5N4j2Klc1Rld0&dib\_tag=se&keywords=baby+food+pouches+refillable&qid=1708644403&sprefix=baby+food+poucn%2Caps%2C341&sr=8-1-spons&sp\_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Modern-Reusable-Food-Pouches/dp/B08SRSWFY6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=37J2J5RL9Y5RJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.bTt4-fkUYWw7NM9Y8YVRco2EdvSKDBbGhQ1UkSwF8Bb9rnevEz02y6zY0RGA8au35PRJCLcSX6wUW9rrA-3qwHhbb5GPNLKe6LGParjW6p-KkaAp_vsmuF8PhDyEuEd3S8qWdTQaadhpigY721Pdyk_-SG2xtZLvAqFIl13xqGyCa7yyePtDqxJhQPRp8hakwZOEv5PQfWg53qaoIrapnna6PMWVK1J5XiJDxVDTexHr4ouALl_1htt4gwUOYWYIdili4KK0yCb7Oz7qCI36fPcyPYGSSoXHN2E9wSPaNAI.o2RowZ4o9FZBcSdUjh4VSw-ylCG9wd5N4j2Klc1Rld0&dib_tag=se&keywords=baby+food+pouches+refillable&qid=1708644403&sprefix=baby+food+poucn%2Caps%2C341&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1)) as they are environmentally friendly, fit my half tights easily, and are dishwasher safe.

&#x200B;

**Electrolytes**

I straight up copied this from Toyman on TrainerRoad. It was easy and cheap enough and has worked well. I suffer from migraines, dehydration being a trigger. I do drink a lot of water every day and typically avoid high salt foods. I have absolutely noticed that this mixture has helped me stay hydrated better and has improved that aspect of my personal life, outside of running. I typically start my day with 16oz of water and 1-1.5g of this. Again, I don't add anything for flavor. You could add lemon juice, citric acid, or flavoring if you want. It's easy enough to drink that it does not bother me. Sodium citrate is much more palatable, so it's almost flavorless to me. There is some evidence regarding improvement in uptake of electrolytes in the presence of carbohydrates. I will often add 10-20 grams of table sugar if I am not consuming any other carbs when taking electrolytes. The below recipe is easily about 100 servings, so it stretches easily.

The recipe:

* 25g MgS04 (magnesium sulfate/epsom salt)
* 8g calcium carbonate
* 80g Morton lite salt
* 367g sodium citrate (hydrated)

You should achieve per 1/2 teaspoon (roughly 3g):

* 1000mg sodium
* 200mg potassium
* 50 mg calcium
* 50 mg magnesium

Note: these ingredients mix well besides the Epsom salt. I put some on a Ziploc bag and used a hammer to smash it into a powder. That way it wouldn't fall to the bottom of the bag and blended better with the mixture.

&#x200B;

**Recovery (Post Run)**

After looking into the recovery drinks, they are pretty simple. With the above recipes you pretty much already have what you need besides the protein. Tailwind Recovery is like $40 and that gets you 15 servings! Skratch isn't much different. Bulk Supplements has whey isolate and casein protein on amazon for pretty cheap. Whey isolate is fast absorbing, casein is slower. I don't know what is better, so I use both. Choose whatever you want here. The post run recovery drinks tend to do a 4:1 carb to protein mixture, which makes the price seem even more outrageous. There must be some science behind that ratio, so use it if you like. That is very little protein, which means your bulk protein powder will last even longer. I use a bit more. For the carbs you can use your carb mix. I prefer table sugar. My above carb mix is only for my gels. I am not as concerned with the post run carb source. Additionally, you could add in something like rice flour to this if you wanted a bit more of a ""whole food"" carb source. Also, feel free to adjust the desired carbs based on how hard your workout was. I am just simply looking for a quick drink to get some nutrition post run. After my shower, getting the kids up and ready, before I head off to work, I do eat a decent balanced breakfast. This just gives my body something to help with recovery. Again, not much for flavor here. I am not picky. Feel free to add what you want (chocolate sauce, vanilla extract, caramel sauce, orange juice, milk, etc.).

I have been doing the following with fine success.

* 1.5g Electrolytes
* 20g - 40g table sugar (based on workout)
* 10g Whey isolate
* 10g Casein
* A few dashes of cinnamon for flavor

&#x200B;

**Future Bonus**

I am currently working on a copycat Maurten 225 Solid bar recipe. Essentially, it's just Rice Krispy cereal, oatmeal, rice flour, and some simple syrup. I haven't nailed the ratios just yet, but when I do, I will update this post as well as probably create a new post. I find this is great to eat before a long run or with my post run breakfast for more carbs after a hard run.

Credit: Jim Downing, Dr. Alex Harrison, Toyman, and I'm sure many others that I gleaned information from as I copied and modified some of these recipes from Reddit, YouTube, and TrainerRoad.

33,1708552588.0,"Race Report: Austin Marathon- well, jog report","I originally signed up for the Austin Marathon sometime mid-summer after a pretty frustrating 2023 (both weather related- I don't do well in hot!). Originally, I was going to make Austin my a-race and find something else fun to do a little later in the season, but pretty soon after signing up, my church announced a  fundraiser event for the San Antonio ""Run the Alamo"" marathon, which is 2 weeks after Austin. So I signed up for that because I'm not smart, and decided to just run Austin as a no-pressure glorified long run.

**Pre-Race**

A cool front blew into the central Texas area Friday evening, bringing morning temps down to the mid-to-high 30s. I live about an 90 minutes away from Austin, but they don't do race-day packet pick up, so I decided to  grab a hotel for Saturday night. I drove up Saturday afternoon, did packet pick up and hit the expo for a bit, before going for a nice easy jog around town lake. Had a pretty light dinner, and went to bed at around 10PM. 

Race day morning was a breakfast of PB toast, a granola bar, a couple of hard-boiled eggs banana, and a cup of coffee. I ate breakfast, did my business, took a shower and headed out by 6AM to make the 7AM start. Weather was absolutely perfect racing weather... just shy of 40F at the starting line, and it stayed pretty cool the whole time. When I finished, I think it was probably mid 50s.

Anyways, Austin has a mass single corral start, so about 6:45, I started wading through the sea of people to try and get around the 4hr crowd. There were a TON of people there. Seriously, it was pretty cramped. Not unexpected, and not a bad thing for me, though. It took us about 5 minutes to get across the starting line after the official start.

**Miles 1-6**

I ran this race about 10 years ago, but they completely changed the course since then. The course now takes you out on about a 6 or 7 mile out-and-back (kindof) along South Congress and South 1st. There were a TON of people out, and it was a pretty good way to start the race. The first 3 miles or so out were rolling hills with a net climb, before turning around and heading back down towards town on South 1st. I went into this race with the goal of just enjoying it and not overdoing anything.  I think I split like 9:15, 9, and 8:45 on the way out, and settled in around 8:20s for most of the rest of the course.

Oh, couple quick thoughts here too. The bib safety pins they provided were absolute garbage. I had to stop 3 times in the first mile to reattach one top pin that kept coming loose before I finally just swapped it out for a bottom pin. Also, as is tradition at this point, I had to pee immediately after I cross the starting line, but I kept being on the wrong side of the street every time we passed restrooms, and the crowd was packed way too dense for me to dart through. I think I finally was able to make it to the bathroom around mile 9.

**Miles 7-9**

This was my favorite short-section of the course, by far. As soon as you cross the lake back into downtown, you were greeted by just masses of people out cheering. Seriously, it felt more like the finish line than the actual finish line of some races. I made a point of taking it all in. At one point, someone somehow (like, how tf does this happen) had lost their shirt and bib, and decided it was a good idea to run against the flow of the crowd to go back and look for it. He crashed head-long into the lady who was running next to me, but she stayed on her feet and was fine-thankfully.  That guy was an idiot- don't be that guy.

**Miles 10-13**

The course loops you out west of town through a few historic neighborhoods up to Oyster Landing, before turning you back east, directly into the rising sun (blinding!), towards downtown. There were a few rolling hills, along with a pretty steep but short climb as you ran under Mopac. The half-marathoners split off at mile 12, to head toward the finish line back on Congress, while the marathoners headed north out towards UT's campus. This stretch of the course was quiet, but was pretty and enjoyable. I'm not used to running with half-marathoners so long, but keeping everyone on the same course through mile 12 or so meant it was a dense field of runners. There was still room to maneuver, but I was glad to not be running with any goals in mind. I think I had caught up with the 3:50 pace group in this section by mile 11 or so, and decided to settle in just ahead of them.

**Miles 14-18**

Campus, finally- HOOK-EM! The course takes you along the drag and up through Hyde Park before turning you back around towards campus on the east side. I was expecting things to open up a bit here, but I was surprised to still feel like everyone was packed in pretty tight. Things finally seemed to space out around mile 17 or 18. Again- tons of people out cheering. I enjoyed every minute of this section of the course, and stayed tucked in with the 3:50 folks. My plan was to get to mile 20, and make a decision about how to run the last 6 miles without overdoing it.

**Miles 19-25**

East Austin! All of this was new to me. There were so many new neighborhoods, shops, restaurants that I'd never seen before or heard of. I won't comment on whether that's good or bad, but it made for a pretty entertaining section of the course. They zig-zag you all the way down to about Pleasant Valley and Cesar Chavez, before turning west towards downtown. Again, SO many people out cheering. There was a bit of downhill for the first few miles of this section, which was nice. I was feeling strong until about mile 23, when the fatigue from some of the earlier hills caught up to me a bit. It was so nice to be able to just back off a bit and enjoy the rest of the race. I walked a few water stations here, and clocked a 9, 10, and 9:15. It was great, lol.

**Mile 26**

The last little section sends you under I35 and up 6th Street a little bit, before doing one final little stretch north toward the Capitol, up a horrible little hill to your left, and then one more left before running downhill to the finish line. I have lots of respect for the people who muscled their way up that hill at 26, but I definitely walked it. That thing would have been brutal if you had a time goal that was coming down to the wire. I got up the hill, and jogged it on in for a comfortable 3:52. 

**Post-Race**

I met up with my wife and kid, and some of the in-laws after the race, then grabbed a hotel shower and checked out before getting some margs and tacos. Felt fatigued and a little tired afterwards, but overall I feel like I did a pretty good job of keeping it easy. Took Monday off, and went on a short run yesterday to keep the legs moving some.

36,1708500327.0,"Running shoe ""recovery"" concensus","TLDR: **Is resting the foam in your shoes good for increasing total mileage of each individual shoe?**

I wanted to post this type of thread again with [this article in the OP](https://runrepeat.com/uk/guides/running-shoe-foams-guide). I'm not saying this is definitive, the citation is just described as ""a chart made by Dow"". 

> In this chart created by the American-based company Dow to showcase the advantages of its EVA + OBC compound, various foams undergo static compression at room temperature for 22 hours. Afterward, they’re set for recovery during 24 hours. If a foam manages to return to its original shape...

> To err on the side of caution, establish a rotation of 2 or 3 pairs of shoes and wait at least 48 hours before using the same model again. And as happens with you, the longer and faster you run, the more rest your shoes will need to recover. By doing so, you'll not only enjoy better leg protection and bounciness, but you'll also extend the lifespan of the shoe by allowing it to fully recover between workouts.

> (Ctrl + F ""Let your shoes rest and recover"" to find this section in the link)

I've seen this question asked a few times, here is the summary of various threads:

- this is not a thing. This answer gets the most upvotes on threads of this topic
- some people say they do rotate, and seem to get more life
- about an equal number of anecdotal comments say the opposite (same life)

I want to preclude ""get shoes for different types of runs"" and ""slightly different shoes may help prevent injury by training different muscles"" discussions to focus on the *foam recovery* phenomenon.

I'm one month in and already have 3 shoes even though all I ever do at this stage of running is ""easy days"", so the facts aren't all that important to me. I'm keeping these shoes regardless lol I just am curious",running

51,1708373241.0,Seville Marathon Race Report,"
I have enjoyed reading the race reports of others on this site but have seen very few from Seville. I am also hoping this will be something of a cathartic race report for myself. Forgive my ramblings below - I’m trying my best on mobile.

Training

This was my first Marathon having run some half marathons in 2023 and a 70.3 triathlon in October. Whilst I enjoyed my training for those events I have to admit I did not ever take the run training seriously, mostly completing an easy 6km loop near my house a couple of times a week however I didn’t really have any issue and completed those events happily. 

Ahead of running my first Marathon I wanted something more structured and largely used the TrainAsONE platform to plan my training. 

Largely this was fine and I enjoyed my introduction to structured training that I could shuffle around as I needed it too. I ran a conservative benchmarking half marathon at the end of November and finished that in 1:34 which gave me a rough goal of 3:15. 

Training largely went well however I got unwell for 2 weeks in January whilst my mileage ramped up and so I peaked at 55km for this and managed a long run of 25km and 31km with MP efforts included in both.  I usually cross trained twice a week on the bike for around two hours per week. 


Pre-race

Tapering was eventful as following my longest run I came down with yet another illness and the following weeks running volume was 3km… However, I felt in great shape coming to Seville and felt pretty prepared. 

Race


Standing on the start line I impulsively decided to set out for 3:20 rather than my initial goal of 3:15 and settled into a rhythm based on that. 

The first 22km rolled by uneventfully as I ticked of the kilometres, took a gel every 5k and an electrolyte tablet at every 10km marker. Every split here was between 4:39 and 4:42 per km and I honestly felt like I could have ran all day. This was easy, this was conversational, my body felt fantastic and I could already looking forward to a beer after finishing!

Unfortunately this is where it all goes wrong. 

Coming around a corner I rolled my ankle in what I think was a pothole / cobble (I have absolutely no idea). I managed to keep running for another 7km however I had to adjust my stride to take some pressure of my ankle and this meant my knee flared up in the process. By the 30km mark I was limping and could barely put any weight on my leg. 

I limped the rest of the course with some jogging where I could. I really didn’t want to DNF my first marathon but it probably would have been wiser to drop out. On the plus side it gave my some time to appreciate this fantastic city as the final 10km goes through the centre of Seville. 


Post-race

I’m not going to lie, Immediately post-race I was absolutely devastated but after sleeping on it I appreciate that it’s just one of those things and I should have been watching the road more carefully. 

Frustratingly If I had simply not had the fitness I could have dealt with that but to have such a great time of it before the incident makes it hard to take. 

Nevertheless I have gone from struggling to run 5km last January to completing my first marathon in what is a great time. 

Thanks for reading - I would definitely recommend Seville for those looking for an early year Marathon.",running

53,1708354511.0,Dealing with racial prejudice when running in public spaces. ,"So I've been training for the Las Vegas half Marathon and generally I run down Las Vegas Blvd when getting in my miles. I normally run to the strip like 6 miles from my house or 5-6 miles to Mandalay Bay. 

I specifically chose Las Vegas Blvd because it's a main throughput with lots of traffic going through. My previous route was much more residential and I've been stopped and side eyed a lot when running in residential sidewalks or streets. 

I'm a black guy in my early 30's with a crystal clean record, put man I'll be honest sometimes I feel nervous about training outside due to the fact that when some people see a black guy running down the street they think trouble, not that I'm running for health or training for an event. Sometimes I see cop look at me intently and it gets a bit scary, I always wave. 

 Some days I don't run due to just not wanting to deal with that reality. I normally place high in my events, but I skip training sometimes to not deal with some of that crap. It can be really discouraging at times like I don't fit in the running space. ",running

\### Training

I'd long been a runner of a certain type: 5km three times a week or so, pushing it every time, and wondering why any distance over that felt impossible. Last year I discovered the joy and power of running easy, and the vista of longer distances opened up. 

I'd never thought of running a race, however,  let alone a marathon. Oddly, the impetus for this one came from a holiday in Italy in September '23. Encouraged by a packed itinerary of churches and museums, my wife and I ended up clocking an absurd average of 30k steps a day. I actually lost weight, despite pastas and gelattos aplenty. And I ended up feeling pretty fit, when I hadn't expected to, exactly five months before the Peninsula Marathon, a straight-out race from near where I live on the west side of Cape Town through to Simonstown on the east coast of the Cape peninsula. 

I asked my brother, a natural runner who had also never run further than 12km or so, whether he might want to join me. He said he'd be delighted, and we both kicked off with Hal Higdon's Novice 2 programme.      

We locked into the programme quickly and happily. Every new long run felt like an accomplishment, but  very manageable. Neither of us suffered any injuries or disruptions. I missed two or three short runs for various reasons, my brother managed every run. It was a joyful experience – first having the lungs open up, then the legs getting stronger, and finally, in the last two months, best of all, having my easy pace increase steadily so I could run, not jog, up to 20 km or so without strain. I'm not a great runner, and I'm 42, but along the way I set PBs of 23 minutes for 5km, 51 minutes for 10km, and under 2 hours for 21km. 

Everything felt manageable, we both felt great, and while we'd both been clear on our goals for this first race – to have fun, soak up the experience, and finish together – a part of me thought that in the next race I could probably think about a personal goal of somewhere around 4 hours.

The hubris!        
\### Pre-race  
Entering the taper, my brother and I laughed about what I had read about 'taper tantrums' and 'maranoia'. So when, exactly one week before the race, I got a tickle in my throat, I chalked it up to psychosomatics. But it quickly became clear it was legitimately somatic. Full-body aches, sweats, a cough ... I made two resolutions: a) i would make the final decision on whether or not to race the day before the race, not before, and b) I wasn't going to let pride dictate whether I raced – I come from a medical family, and I know well the dangers of overexertion on a sick-taxed body. After a committed hydration, rest, ginger and fruit regimen, three days before the race I woke up feeling I'd turned the corner. Two days before I was at 95%, and the day before I felt great. I'd never recorded a fever during the sickness, so I was happy to make the call: we were on. Let the empastafication commence 🍝!     
\### Race  
The race takes place in the middle of summer, so it begins early, at 5.15am. We got there in the dark and joined a queue, which we soon realised was for the toilets ... there were not many given the 4000ish runners assembled. We left the queue and milled around, and then both decided we should actually piss. This led to the first odd event of the day. By the time we'd gotten to the toilets the gun had gone off. We weren't too bothered, the timing was mat to mat, but we did end up being amongst the last handful of people to set off, five minutes or so after race start. This turned out to be pleasant in a way; running through the city more or less alone, and gradually catching up the the rest of the pack; starting at the back meant that we were overtaking people consistently for half the race, which was good for morale. 

But let me be clear: my sickness that week had reinforced our plans to take it super easy. We approached the race like an easy training long run. We'd jog the first 16km, and then take it from there. We weren't out to pass people for the sake of it. 

But we were both feeling great! Lungs were good, energy was good, the marshals and police were wonderfully warm and encouraging, people were starting to come out of their homes to cheer us on. It was such a cool way to see our city. Coming around the mountain below Newlands the skyline opens up, the cool smell of oaks and grass kits you, and everything felt A-OK. 

The only niggle, from about 10km in, was a slight pain in the tendon (ligament?) below my right kneecap. This was odd – I'd never felt any localised leg pain in training – and exacerbated slightly by the fact that the road hadn't been completely closed off, which meant that we were running in the left-hand lane the whole way, and this meant a consistent camber, which, after a while, began to grate. 

When we took stock at 21km, though, we were both still enjoying ourselves thoroughly. It felt as though we were comfortably in the middle of the pack, we were running at what felt like the perfect pace, well within our comfort zones. The weather was perfect, the infamous cape winds had taken a day off. 

Then everything began to go wrong. My knee just got more and more painful. I stopped and flexed it a few times, but couldn't find a stretch that targeted it. If it had been a pain that indicated injury or impending injury I would have thought about stopping, but it didn't seem to. I don't know why I was convinced of that, but I was. It was just a dull tightness that every so often would flare up into heat and unpleasantness. I'm not averse to pain and I decided to embrace it as a fellow traveler. I was still feeling positive, and we just slowed down a bit. But it got worse.

At around 30km you leave the inland suburbs, emerge at Muizenberg, and the *raison d'être* of the race lies ahead of you: 12km of the most beautiful coastal road, flat, with the Kalk Bay mountains to your right and the False Bay ocean to your left. This is a section we'd run several times in our training. It's always the part of the run I'd most looked forward to. In my mind we would have paced ourselves correctly by this point, and if, in fact, we had a bit of pep, this would be the time to engage it, to stretch the legs, feel the wind on our faces, smile at one another and the view and our fellow marathoners and enjoy a bit of a push to the finish. 

Instead I could barely run. I had to start taking walk breaks. It was heartbreaking. And the pain kept increasing. Soon the walk breaks turned into run breaks between walks. From 32km until the finish we walked more than we ran. Then even walking was difficult. If my brother hadn't been there I might have given up, but that became my goal; not running a marathon, not setting a goal time, but simply walking, putting one foot in front of the other, for 8, 6, 4, 2 more kilometres. 

Pitiful! I felt like crying. I felt humiliated. I also felt ... heroic? It was genuinely difficult what I did! It required a great deal of will not to stop, to keep pushing through the pain. I gave it all I could have. Over the course of the day my race ambitions had changed from running my first marathon in a creditable time, to managing to run a few hobbled steps over the finish line. Who would have guessed? Pathetic.    

  
\### Post-race  
Our partners were both traveling so we caught one of the race buses back to the start. The bus ride was absolutely interminable through the traffic and the heat of the day. We all smelt riotous. The group next to us were absurdly experienced runners – two of them had run close to 200 marathons, one had run a marathon in another province the previous day! It was unreal to hear their stories. Everyone has their own goals, and few runners are completely satisfied with their performance, whatever that might have been. 

My legs are stiff but no lasting damage has been done. Before this race I was pretty sure that my first marathon would not be my last. After that suffer-fest I'm I bit more wary. The half marathon distance seems a lot more reasonable, and I think I'll aim for one of those as a next goal. Overall I'm exceptionally glad to have gone through four months of training, to be fitter than I probably ever have been, to have shared that experience with my brother, and to have pushed to get across the line. I'm also completely humbled and ashamed, and full of respect for y'all and your madness. Cheers.

### Training
Read the 80/20 book and followed the Level 2 marathon training plan. I only did ~65% of the runs, but I did do most of the long runs. I did miss about 3 weeks of training right before the taper phase because I got sick, then the weather turned freezing and I didn’t want to risk getting sick again, and then I went on a liquid fast for church. So I almost felt like I had to get back into gear with the taper phase.

### Pre-race
Ate a bowl of oatmeal and sipped some coffee in the morning. Parking was crazy so I barely managed to get in place for the race 3 min before it began. I was near the 4:50 pacer and I was aiming to stick with her as long as I could. It was mega cold and I was shivering. Very thankful I brought a head warmer and gloves. I had to pee so bad.

### Race
4:50 pacer just took off lol. Never saw her again. Mile 5, I took a 7 min break at a long line for portapotties and regretted not going to the earlier ones. First 13 miles were a breeze, which is crazy because I did my first half marathon only the year before. It’s crazy how much marathon training and cranking out 12+ miles on the regular can shift your perspective on previously hard things. 

Crowds definitely thinned out during miles 13-20, and it got cold again without all the bodies. Momentum-wise, I felt a bit slower without all the runners and fatigue starting to kick in more. Definitely started feeling some foot pain during this time but it was very bearable and these miles were a bit of a blur. 

Mile 20-21 is when the foot pain really hit me. Every step hurt. Then my hamstrings started hurting with each step, then my hips. Not serious issues, but it was definitely painful. I started to walk every time I went to a hydration station. I had to let loose battle cries every time I started running again.

Miles 22-26 were a battle. Every time I saw a mile marker, I was so happy. Each volunteer at the hydration stations had the face of an angel. I started thinking about why humans make up unnecessary obstacles to overcome, and why I chose to be a part of it. 

Giant hill right before mile 26. That was one big F-U to marathon runners lol. Sprinted as best as I could the last 0.2 miles.

### Post-race
I actually felt pretty good right after the race. I thought I would be limping across the finish line, but I was able to walk like a normal person for the most part. My limiting factors were definitely more about my feet pain than anything else. Heart-wise and energy-wise, I felt pretty good. Soreness gradually set in as the endorphins wore off. Then I started walking like a newborn giraffe.

I took a chair with me into the shower. It was wonderful.

Now I am a potato.

Overall, despite the hardship, all the pain past, present, and future, the marathon was truly a fun and transformative experience and I’m amazed that I was even able to do this. One thing I hope to take away from this is that I am capable of so much more than I think, and I want to be able to apply that to other parts of my life. Thanks running for the journey you’ve taken me on :)

# Training

So literally my first run after my last half after taking two days off I pulled my hamstring and had to take a week and a half off, so training didn’t get off to the greatest start.

I didn’t follow any specific plan, again, I just created my own plan of increasing mileage from 25-48 miles/wk with 1-2 speed sessions a week, 1 long run every other week, and lots of easier runs. I also included a lot of hill runs and lots of treadmill runs due to weather.

My longest run was 15 miles. My 48 mile week was 3 weeks prior to the race and then I tapered down from there.

# Pre-race

Made a game time decision to wear a long sleeve shirt and tights instead of a singlet due to it being 33F. I was also fortunate to stay at an Airbnb that was literally 2 blocks from the start, so there was no stress getting there. Drank a monster the morning of, taped my nips, took like 4 separate poops, took some Imodium, ate a caffeinated Gu gel, and warmed up around the gear check. Then got my last pee in (thankfully there was plenty of port-a-potties) right before the start.

# Race

Mile 1-4

The first half mile is a slight downhill, then the next 3 miles are all a constant uphill. This was the part of the race that gave me the most stress because I was worried I was going burn myself out. I did so many long hill runs and treadmill runs at 4+ incline for miles to prepare.  My original plan was to maintain a 7:50 pace on this stretch and speed up on the downhill significantly; however, I overestimated how grueling the first few miles would be, and it was actually a very gradual slope, and quickly realized I could pick up the pace earlier than expected. Then I hit that glorious downhill a little over 3.5 miles in which felt amazing.

Miles 5-8

This was the part I was excited about where I knew I could really stretch out my stride and really pick up the pace. Miles 5-7 are basically a constant gradual downhill, and mile 8 levels off a bit. These miles felt great.

Miles 9-13.1

This is the part of the race I really underestimated the difficulty. That first of the many rolling hills comes right around the start of mile 9 and they just keep on coming until the end. I think my heart rate hit 198 on one of the hills on mile 11 which also right around when I mistakenly threw Gatorade on my face instead of what I thought was water and was annoyingly sticky for the remainder of the race. The worst of the hills though was definitely right at mile 12. Once that hill was over; however, it was a sweet downhill to the finish line.

# Post-race

My girlfriend and buddy met me at the finish line and we got to hug it out and there were lots of congratulations, and then we went to go grab some post race beers. I then went up to my Airbnb to shower and then we went down to The Pub and watched Man U play and drank a few more beers and ate some food while waiting for another buddy of mine and his wife to finish running the full.

Once he got there, we grabbed some shots, and some more beer, and then I called it a day and my amazing girlfriend drove my drunk ass back home where I am now posting this race report.

It was a great time! There was a ton of crowd support, I did a lot better than I expected, and had several friends around giving me lots of love. Definitely a great experience.

67,1708263689.0,Achieving Peak Week mileage with limited time,"Hi! I’m running my first marathon next month, and have been consistently training with no lapses in workouts. This week is my Peak Week, but I’m running up against limited time — miles should be 40 (I’m a slower runner right now since I’m coming back from an Achilles tear, but have run 5 half marathons since end of 2022). Today was supposed to be 18 miles, but we have a wedding to attend so I moved my Thursday run to today since it’s shorter and then will do 18 tomorrow as I’m off for the holiday. But we are expecting a big storm and I don’t have access to a treadmill. I’m worried I’m not going to get that full 18 miles in since we get flooding.

I was looking for similar situations and some folks said that weekly mileage is more important than the long run itself, so could I potentially get 40 miles in broken up in the week if I’m unable to complete 18 tomorrow? I still have a 19 mile run next Sunday, my longest in training. Any advice would be helpful — thank you!",running

Standing, glaring at me. I approached… cautiously, curiously.. it spread its wings and began to take off. Absolutely magnificent and terrifying at the same time. It had a huge rat in its talons. 

All of this happened in a matter of seconds in the middle of my run.

69,1708258004.0,Generic soft bottles with Salomon Sense Pro 5,"I recently got my first running vest (model in title) and it came with two 500ml soft bottles. The design of the default Salomon bottles is shockingly bad, as they have hard bases which push into your ribs when you run. I am looking to buy replacements, (probably this product), but I am wondering if it is worth going for Salomon instead of a random Amazon brand. The main thing I like about the Salomon bottles is the elastic loop which goes around the top of the bottle fits perfectly. Does anyone have any advice on this? Is the loop not a big deal, and will going for a generic not make a difference?",running

73,1708194013.0,Running watch - ecosystem & data,"Probably this topic has been raised in the past, but from 2024 perspective it might be worth reviewing.
Which ecosystem except Garmin one do you consider to be most useful for you as a runner? I'm wondering which way to go and invest into - mainly concerned about coros and suunto and respectfully race & pace 3 watches as main run-tracking device - while both devices are fine I'm looking mainly into collecting some feedbacks related to ecosystems around those devices and data they can produce mainly for a runner. While coros is focused mainly on running and barely on anything else, suunto seems to be a bit better balanced probably?
And also, how useful for you is coros' evolab on desktop?",running
74,1708185902.0,80/20 Running book: Portrayal of Kenya,"I'm reading '80/20 Running' by Matt Fitzgerald. While I'm completely on board with the core message of running slower and further, I find his portrayal of Kenya in Chapter 2 uncomfortable and lacks any kind of nuance about indigenous knowledge. I'm surprised that a chapter like that could be published in a book in 2014! 

The chapter says the following: 'Kenyan runners would never have become the leading force in running that they are today if not for a fortuitous accident. British missionaries in Kenya endeavoured to spread Christianity and education by building schools... Many of the children who attended these schools ran to and from class daily, motorized transportation being a luxury few could afford. The missionnaires certainly had no intention of putting thousands of Kenyan boots and girls on a low-intensity, high volume running program, but that's essentially what happened'...... So, Kenyans learned to run regularly because the British built schools far from their villages? Isn't it also (and much more so) that Kenya has a rich history going back thousands of years where people run long distances to track for hunting? 

By saying that Kenya only started winning marathons since the Boston marathon 1988 completely misses there's a long history of running that's not competitive, and more importantly that's not competitive in Western marathon history. Why is running only something that gets validated when it's noticed in the West? Maybe Kenya's 'rise to supremacy' is viewed as a 'story of overnight success' is because they started showing up to American races...

He says: 'Lydiard-style training came to Kenya at about the same time'.... Why not more accurately say that Lydiard-style running is deeply indebted to the indigenous knowledge among running in Kenya? This 80/20 approach is clearly something that's embedded into the history of running in Kenya. Can't he just say that, instead of time-and-again claiming that missionnaires and trainers from the West arrived in Kenya, building schools far from villages without adequate transport, and emancipating the Kenyans with knowledge that they already possessed and that was actually their indigenous knowledge in the first place?",running

So my running coach is a very high level ultra runner, and has been coaching me towards my first ultra. I’m paying £70 a month for ‘tailored’ runs, that seem pretty generic in all honesty. I’ve never met him face to face, despite this being mentioned on several occasions.. I don’t get much feedback and sometimes feel left to my own devices (understandably it’s my goal), is this the norm? 

He’s also still training for ultras alongside coaching, which I don’t mind at all, but maybe feel like his focus is elsewhere?

We're trying to take advantage of one of New Reddit's features, collections.  It lets the mods group posts into Collections.  We're giving it a try on posts that get good feedback that would be useful for future users.  We've setup some common topic Collections and will add new posts to these as they arise as well as start new Collections as needed.

###**Using r/running**



The mods do their best to actively moderate this community. When posting, we expect users to make an effort to familiarize themselves with our rules and practices before submitting posts or comments. We suggest taking note of **Rule 2** *and* **Rule 7**, *since these are the most commonly broken which will result in a thread being removed.*

The mod team has tried to lay out the rules with some expected guidelines of what is or is not allowed, but there is always some gray area and posts are up to interpretation by the mod team.  We do our best to be consistent, but that isn’t always the case with multiple mods or even the same mod between similar posts.  The mod team wants to make /r/running a resource for new and experienced runners and to build a community between all types of runners.

Regardless of that fact, Moderators have the final say.  We are open to hearing differing opinions, but the mod team will make the final decision.  Visitors and posters in /r/running are expected to understand that the mod team are people too and doing the best they can to manage a very large sub with frequent posts every day.  If you do not agree with how this sub is moderated, we expect you to do so in a civil manner….and also know when it is time to drop it.

We are very upfront in stating that the sub is heavily moderated, but we do recognize that not every user wants that.  The wonderful thing about reddit is that there are plenty of subs to check out and hopefully find one more to your liking.  If you find the  moderation here too strict, some other related subs with less moderation are /r/runninglifestyle/, /r/BeginnersRunning/, /r/runningquestions/, and /r/Runners/.

###**Recurring Threads**

In order to reduce clutter and nudge you lurkers into posting, we have created a number of daily and weekly threads for you to read, make a comment, or ask a question. Unless you truly believe your new thread will make a new and interesting contribution to Runnit, please wait until the related weekly thread rolls around and post in there instead.  A more complete description of the threads can be [found in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_reccuring_threads).

Here are the current recurring threads with links to the most recent (hopefully) weekly thread:  

*Please note that the search links for the daily threads (Q&A and Achievement) will not work on mobile.  If you are using mobile, sort the sub by ""Hot"" and the current Q&A thread will be stickied at the top.  For the Achievement thread, sort by ""New"" and scroll down a bit to find the current Achievement thread.*

* [Daily Achievement Thread (Posted daily)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=%22achievements+for%22+author%3Aautomoderator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all): Any and all accomplishment posts should be posted here. Anything from new PRs, to longest weekly mileage, to running your first ultra – literally any accomplishments you experienced recently!

* [General Q&A Thread (Posted daily)](https://old.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=Official+Q%26A&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all): With such a large sub, there are a lot of running-related questions that come in every day. In an effort to keep the front page of the sub uncluttered and fresh, we ask you post your questions, particularly those one-off questions that are potentially short and don't necessarily provoke significant discussion, in the daily General Q&A thread.

###**Rules**
We have further [explanations of the rules in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_rules), but as noted in the side bar, please take note of Rule 2 and Rule 7 as they are the ones most cited for post removals.

 **(2)** - *Posts need to generate discussion and/or useful information that other searchers can then benefit from. Low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts, posts not directly related to running, and questions that are easily answered by FAQ, searching r/running, or Google are subject to removal at the moderation team's discretion.*  

This sub attracts a lot of beginners as well as “drive-by” posting.  A major goal of the sub is to promote quality discussion and develop a community where information and experiences can be shared.  Many of the common questions have been answered, either in previous threads/FAQ, or could easily be answered in the daily Q&A thread.  Yes, circumstances can vary person to person, but it is expected that posters make an attempt to find these answers for themselves before making a stand-alone post.   Visitors should put forth some effort in finding the answer themselves and not expect the Runnit community to do all the work for them.  If the post/question is very specific to your situation (such that other general user won't get much benefit from the information), then it belongs in the daily Q&A thread.

If you do make a stand-alone post, please include info relevant for the community to help.  It is nearly impossible to offer any advice without sufficient background information.  Items that could be relevant:

* Age

* Sex

* Current MPW + pace

* Previous peak MPW

* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed

* Goals (including specific races)

* Previous PRs

* Other things you think might be helpful to include

Below are some of the reason a post would be considered low-quality, thus being removed and directed to the Daily Q&A thread:

* ""Does anyone else..."" type posts?

* ""Is X a good time for...?"" posts

* If your post is a question in the title (including “See title” or “Title says it all” in the body).

* If your question can be asked in one sentence.

* If your question is very specific to you or your situation.

* If your question can be answered either with a yes/no.

* In general, it is helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  

* Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.

Finally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of r/running, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.

 **(7)** - *Do not solicit medical advice. This includes 'Has anyone else experienced this injury?' type posts.*  

While there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some minor, common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  

There is a big difference between ""Hey, my IT band is tight. Got any good stretches for it?"" and ""My shins hurt every time I run. If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?"" If your question involves sharp pains, unknown/vague pains, or injuries/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.

Also, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.

**Training**

Some stats! I'm a 34F, been running pretty consistently for 10+ years. I've ran 3 marathons previously and they've all been the at the Austin Marathon. My last year at Austin Marathon was pretty rough and left me a tiny bit discouraged, and I decided I needed to run a nicer, less hilly marathon. I settled on Mesa Marathon, as it fit right into my desired time frame, had some cooler temps and is relatively downhill.

In preparation for my training cycle, I was running a 30-35 mpw base for a couple of months. I decided to use Hanson's Beginner Marathon as my training plan again, even though I knew it'd burn me out a bit, just like it did last year (just something about only having to do a 16 mile long run, man). All things considered, I really did a great job with consistency here. I only missed one week due to an anniversary hiking trip in Big Bend, but otherwise did every speed workout and long run. I wasn't sure what to expect pace wise-- I loosely had decided that my marathon pace could be \~9:55 but would see what felt right as I ran. Most of my interval runs were sitting around 9:15 and most tempo runs at marathon pace were 9:55 or faster!

**Pre-race**

My parents flew into Mesa a day or two before my husband and I did, and picked us up from the airport. I did not have a ton of PTO saved up for this so only came in on Friday morning and was going to fly out Sunday afternoon. Once we got to our AirBnB, my husband, my dad and I hit an easy 5k and then got set up to go to expo for bib pick up.

After, we decided to go to the Botanical Gardens, which was actually pretty nice. We walked around quite a bit which wasn't really my ideal-- I had no idea it would be THAT much walking! I clocked about 20k steps that day. After, we went and got pizza, made a quick trip to Walmart for a cheap rain poncho (shout out to one of the race organizers for recommending this to me!) and came home for an early sleep. My husband and I were up at 3am to catch our flight before so we were exhausted! I was lucky to be in bed by 8pm and actually slept relatively well.

**Race**

I was up at 2am to make sure I gave myself enough time to eat, drink and get ready. I had 2 packets of oats overnight (loooooove), a nuun and a cup of coffee and got dressed for what was supposed to be a cool and rainy morning. I am a huge fan of cold runs so opted for shorts and a cropped tank, and then just donned that cheap rain poncho and carried a mylar blanket with me. My dad and husband also got up early and we headed for the bus drop off by 3:45 or so, arriving right around 4:30. It was a decent walk in the rain once they dropped me off, but I was glad we did this early as I had heard later that traffic got awful and there may have been some issues with the bus.

I hopped on the marathon bus and had a lovely chat with an older lady who told me she had run this race 9 times and that she was set to run 50 marathons before she turned 50! What a badass. She was a delight to chat with. Honestly, I chatted with a bunch of people since the start time wasn't until 6:30 and it was a great way to pass the time in the cold rain. If any of you are reading this-- let me know how your race went!

Unfortunately, they had to delay the start of the race from 6:30 to 7:00. I was actually a little happy about it because it gave me time to pee beforehand-- but then they suddenly announced later that they were now going to start at 6:50! At this point, I hesitantly began discarding my mylar blanket and poncho and slowly made my way to the start... Only to find out that the race had already started? I was super confused as I hadn't heard any announcement or gun! I then got all my shit together and decided to go.

The weird start really threw me off-- I had planned on running around the 4:20 pace group, but ended up starting behind the 6:00 pace group! Ah!! For the first mile or two, I wasn't feeling great. My toes were cold and wet from the rain and I had a weird side stitch that lasted awhile. I went out easy as planned, though, and enjoyed the first \~3-4 miles that were downhill.

Around mile 4 you start to hit a steady uphill, which felt probably way longer than it actually was. This felt surprisingly difficult, but fortunately it's early on in the race. After that, you're back to gradual downhill. The gal I chatted with on the bus explained that she'd never do the half marathon at Mesa, only the full because the first half is beautiful and downhill, while the second half is flat. I def agree with her! The first half was way better.

I was pretty shocked at the pace I was maintaining and was nervous about trying to maintain it versus slowing it down. I'm always very cautious of going out to quick and have always thought about how you need to start slow to end strong, but I guess my marathon brain went a little haywire because I had decided I needed to HOLD this quicker pace just in case I bonked later and needed to build in walking time. SO backwards, but I was lucky that it worked out for me.

By about mile 9? or so I was running near a group of younger guys who were making me laugh by cheering and shouting all the time. They were such a delight. I tried to run mostly near them just because it was such a joy to have someone cheering and excited. One of the things I didn't enjoy about Mesa was the lack of crowd support-- a lot of times I felt like I was running in mostly silence and without many spectators, and it was such a big change from the crowd support you get at Austin Marathon.

I started up a conversation with those 2 guys and they explained they had signed up for this marathon on a whim a couple of weeks ago and hadn't trained and it was their first marathon! I was so amused/shocked and honestly a little embarrassed that the were maintaining my marathon pace, lol! They felt so fast. One asked me if marathons get easier and I had a good laugh. My first marathon was such a joy, and these subsequent races have always been so much harder since I know what I'm capable of and I'm actually racing them.

I kept up with them for as long as I could but ultimately decided that I was running a little too quick and needed to cool it down a bit so let them pass me. I did see one of them later at a water station but I'm curious how they finished!

At about the half way mark, it began to rain again and I most definitely stepped in a puddle at some point, so that was great. After the half point, it begins to get flat and fairly residential/boring so I was really looking forward to mile 16, where my parents and husband were supposed to be cheering me on.

My dad showed up right on cue and ran with me for a mile where he refilled my hand water bottle and gave me a bag of oranges to munch on. If you've ever read any of my previous race recaps, you'll know my dad is such a joy. He started running because he wanted to run races with me! So he jokingly was telling me that he was now running his 4th marathon. He split off from me after to catch the finish.

By mile 17, it was beginning to feel hard. I don't think I ever hit ""the wall"" per se, but running the same pace on flat pavement definitely was a struggle. I think I did a much better job of fueling and hydrating for this race so I'm sure that helped-- I was alternating salt tabs and huma gels every 2 miles or so, sipping on my hand water bottle and then stopping briefly at most water stations to walk and drink whatever I managed to grab.

By about mile 22, I was really starting to feel it and was finding myself really trying to stick near the 4:20 pacers or slightly ahead of them. I was feeling proud that I had started behind the 6:00 pacer and then managed to catch up to the original pace group I had intended to run with!

It was also around this point where I began to REALLY look forward to the water stations so that I could walk a tiny bit in order to drink something. I remember thinking mile 22 was somehow the last one, and then eventually seeing mile 24 in the distance and nearly crying because I was so thrilled I'd get to walk and drink some more gatorade, haha.

Mile 25-26 were definitely the hardest. The crowds were still so minimal and you can't even see the finish line in the distance! Having never ran this race before, I was trying to find some inkling that the ending was near and it just never came. The sun also started to come out, which I hated, and the balls of my feet/toes were finally starting to hurt due to the wetness.

I actually remember at one point looking at the guy next to me and shouting ""where is this finish line?!"" because I was so over it and I couldn't see it or any huge crowds coming up!

Regardless, I started to really book it in that last mile. There was actually a nice little crowd towards the end and my husband and parents actually made the finish! I started cheering and screaming when I saw them and again, was very overwhelmed with emotion that I was finishing my race and I knew I had PRed my marathon time.

**Post-race**

I got my medal, saw my dad right at the side of the corral and immediately hugged him over the rails. I was tearing up and so was he. Then I made my way through, picking up some snacks along the way and met up with my husband and mom after for huge hugs and congratulations. We were able to go and get a little print out with your race data, and immediately upon reading my pace and finish time, I started to cry. 4:15:00 was the ""A"" goal I had set for myself last year and I was completely shocked that I nearly beat that time this go around! I looked at 9:44 pace overall and was completely overwhelmed with emotion and pride in myself. I was so scared I wouldn't be able to maintain a 9:55 when I woke up that morning.

After, we got some food and headed back to our AirBnb. I was pretty beat up and exhausted so spent the rest of the day laying around watching Twitch. My appetite was shot until I had some great Mexican food for dinner and then I forced myself to eat a pint of ice cream after because... why not? I also found out I did get a couple of blisters on my toes/ball of my foot from the rain that made walking a bit lousy for a day or so, but definitely fine now.

Sunday was my flight back but my husband and I spent a good portion of it wandering around Phoenix to hit up some book stores and local coffee shops. It was great! I even managed to get my 10k steps in (I'm on 1,140 day streak currently) despite my legs still feeling like death.

I'm now mostly recovered-- my calves are a little sore, but I've been getting my 10k steps in and walking. Originally, I had planned on taking a little running break after my marathon and trying to shift my focus to strength training, but I'm finding I already miss running. I don't think I've gone more than 2-3 days without running since my last marathon, and it feels weird. I'm hoping to hop back into some easy runs this weekend, and while I don't think I want to run another marathon soon, I do kinda wanna run an ultra instead, so we'll see what happens.

92,1707945959.0,Best double jogging stroller,"I have a 17 month-old and a second on the way in May. We currently have the Thule Urban Glide 2 and love everything about it *except* that it doesn't allow our daughter to sit up far enough. Usually it's fine when running as she just passes out anyway, but as she's getting older we can tell that she wants to sit up more. If not for this I would 100% be getting the Thule Urban Glide 3 double, which appears to be equally reclined (though I may be wrong)

What is the best alternative to this and how do they handle infants for the first 6 months before running? We loved the infant insert on the Thule as an alternative to clicking in a car seat. Does any other stroller have something similar? Price is not a concern

### Training
I followed Hal Higdon's [Intermediate 2](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-2-marathon/) plan for my race. I'd been running consistently for about a year when I started and was averaging 20ish mpw over 4 days of running a week. I was worried it might be a bit ambitious but it mostly went ok, more on that in a second. I skipped the last 10/20 pair because of a family wedding (no regrets) and missed the occasional run due to whatever illness my toddler brought home from daycare. Overall I hit 530 of the 600ish total miles the plan calls for. Almost every run was done solo before anyone else in the house was up, so major kudos to my Noxgear vest for keeping me alive. No training injuries and lots of miles meant a few new pairs of shoes!

To anyone thinking about doing this plan: I'd strongly encourage you to be at 25mpw before jumping in, and extra strongly encourage you to be already running 5 days a week. 20mpw at 4x a week was not as strong of a starting point for this plan as I hoped. This is not a great plan if you have never run a marathon before or if you have an aggressive time goal. There's no ""speed work"" where speed = faster than race pace. The closest you get is every other week doing some miles at race pace.

Experimented a lot with food/hydration to find what works, and even got myself eating before my long runs despite the already-early alarm clock.

### Pre-race
I ran the half last year so I knew what to expect for logistics. Spoiler alert: they're a nightmare the morning of. Packet pickup was fine on Friday. 3:30am alarm for Saturday, was out the door by 4:10 with toast/PB/banana and coffee taken care of. I even remembered my thrift store discard clothes! The normally 15 minute drive took me an hour (50 minutes to go the last half mile and find a parking spot). Used the port-a-potty before getting in the marathon bus line where I spent 20 minutes standing in the drizzle kindly telling half-marathoners they were in the wrong bus line before they got more busses to arrive. Got on the bus and arrived at the start line 15 minutes before the scheduled 6:30 start.

6:25 - They announce a new start time of 7:00 due to traffic/weather. Not ideal because of drizzle and temps in the low 40s, but whatever.
6:45 - National anthem
6:47ish - They announce a new start time of 6:50. This caused some chaos but I managed to ditch my sweats and get to the start line.

### Race
6:52 I was off. The first half is downhill except for miles 4 to 5.25. I stayed with the 4:05 pace group to take advantage of the downhill without going too fast, but they slowed down more than I was happy with for the climb so I went on ahead (big mistake). I cruised through the first 14 miles feeling really good about myself and wondering if I had it in me to do sub-4. Crossed the half at 2:00:33 which was a big clue that sub-4 wasn't likely, but I wasn't ready to accept it based on how well the race was going for me. Drizzled for the first few miles but let up and got nice for a while.

Started raining/drizzling at or shortly after the halfway mark, and at mile 15 my hips started to feel tight. I was atrocious about stretching and strength training and was paying for it. Kept doing ok until mile 20 where I hit a wall. Mostly physical but was not in a great place mentally either. Managed to do the last 10k where at some point I realized that besides the hip aches, lack of muscle energy, and wet socks/shoes I had also started chafing under my shirt. Everyone who should have clearly noticed was gracious enough to not say anything. I'll just say that I won't be getting any race photos printed. Made it across the finish line at 4:12:59 feeling absolutely awful. My brain and body were both in places they'd never been before.

### Post-race
Limped through the finisher area and grabbed chocolate milk, a banana, some water, and a granola bar. Found my wife and kid and semi-collapsed into them sobbing. Limped around the muddy finish area for a few minutes because I was afraid to sit, then got home and took the most incredible hot shower I think I've ever taken. Surprisingly few blisters. Spent the rest of the day with a toddler who didn't understand why I couldn't pick them up or crouch down to play with them, and turned in early. I'm mostly physically recovered by now, just a few small aches and pains.

I'm very proud of a few things:
-Being really consistent with the training plan
-Finishing!
-Sticking to my ""Gu every 4 miles"" plan and getting fluids at every aid station
-Meeting my original goal of an average pace below 10:00min/mi
-How I felt for the first half. I'll be chasing that feeling for a while.

I had some learning moments too:
-Feeling good on the downhill first half and assuming that means a good second half is a fool's errand for a new runner
-I was not ready psychologically for the back half, especially miles 20-26.2
-This wasn't a super first marathon, course-wise. Not particularly scenic and not a lot of spectators (also lots of roads shared with cars, but I knew that from the half). You won't get a lot of boost from the environment at this race.

Will do it again? A marathon seems likely, at least to do one in better weather, but the Mesa Marathon? Eh. I'm not sold that the convenience of a short drive was worth everything else that happened (both in and out of the organizer's control).

What's next? A trail 40k in April because I'm the fool who signed up for that before the marathon. At least it will be prettier!

*I should clarify my ""The Usual"" goal comment. I've been doing trail races the past year and my partner and I have a joke that goal number one is always don't get hurt. Goal 2 has always been 'finish' and goal 3 has always been 'have fun'. I've combined these into one standing ""Usual Goal"" for all my races.

About 5 miles in, I see a cone marking the turnaround point for what appeared to be a small 10k fun run or something. As I ran past, I asked one of the guys standing at the turnaround if I can use the path. They say sure, there aren't that many people in the race, no problem.

So I keep running, and start to see more and more people running with bib numbers. It was fairly cold out, and some people's bib numbers were barely visible if they'd put on a jacket or had it pinned somewhere not so prominent. As I pass an aid station, they start cheering me on saying to keep going and I'm doing great. I assume they just thought my bib number wasn't visible, and I was too cold to really stop and say anything otherwise.

Now I'm starting to pass people left and right. They really look in poor form, most of them pretty raggedy and just staggering along. I think to myself, man I am CRUSHING these guys, this must be the worst 10k I've ever seen. Note to self, look this race up later and dominate the next one!

After passing ~20 people, I see a sign up ahead marking the mileage... **""50k turnaround, 50 mile turnaround ahead.""** *WHAT???* Turns out I stumbled upon an ultra, and these poor runners I was passing were likely about 20 miles into their run.

I felt like a complete idiot, but still had a few miles to go on my route, so I kept going. Passing the next aid station, the workers yell to me ""Keep going! You look incredible!"" No shit, relative to someone running an ultra.

I try to reply ""Sorry I'm not actually running in this race, but thanks!"" But being about 40F outside, my mouth dexterity is all but gone, and I manage to slur ""I'm not running!"" The aid workers look at each other with a puzzled look on their faces, and must have determined I was delirious or something, because they responded, ""Yeaaaaaah you're running! You look amazing! Keep it up!""

I'm too ashamed at this point to correct them, and just keep running past. About a mile later I duck off the course and quickly run to a coffee shop to hide my head in shame.

TL;DR - Unwittingly join an ultra, pass other runners, realize they are ~20 miles into an ultra, aid station thinks I am wunderkind of ultras.

edit: Haven't had access to reddit most of the afternoon... to answer questions - the race was the lakefront 50/50 in Chicago, which is a 50k and 50 mile race on the same course just more laps from what I can gather on their website. I saw the 50k turnaround sign, so I guess the first one I passed was for the 50 miler crowd. Also my bad for cringe worthy title, I don't internet good.",running

 February 15, I came home from work, to find my fiancee u/weeleigh, was not home. Thinking nothing of it as our Devil Dog was also gone I figured she was out for a run, which is very normal. I assumed she would be back shortly as she just got over a toe injury. 30 minutes later, I figured she was going for a bit longer. Boy was I wrong.

An hour later, I started to get worried. I then received a call from her father. My world came crashing down. She was struck by a car while running in the heart of Baltimore City, the Inner Harbor. She was crossing a major intersection. My worst fears have come to. They took her to Shock Trauma where she was fighting for life. They took the Devil Dog to the pet er. There was massive trauma to her head, but I knew if there was any chance of survival she could. Luckily, she was at the best Neurohospital in the nation. We were told 2 weeks to see what the damage would be.

The next day the doctors called for a family meeting. And I knew. I didn't want to go to the hospital. I didn't want to lose her, my fiancee, my best friend, and my running partner. The damage was too severe. They literally did all they could to save her. In short, we donated her organs and it saved at least 3 peoples lives. 

I held her hand as they took her off life support as I promised her I would never leave her until the very end. I can't believe such a wonderful woman was taken from me, from her family, from her friends. I can't believe that someone who worked so hard to be healthy, to extend her life, was gone.

u/WeeLeigh was so committed to life and to running that she was, when struck, doing her 351st run in a row. She was excited to get to 365, to train for Ultras, and of course to plan our wedding. On March 1st, what would have been her 365 day of running I restarted my own streak, with my friends and the Devil Dog recovered from her own injuries (I ended it 280 days while staying at the hospital.) I figured I would continue what she cannot do anymore.

On a general PSA, please, please, please, check both ways while running across intersections. We are 100% sure that she was in the right, something tragic happened. I will make another post about a memorial run for her.

119,1603483850.0,"I lost my job, I'm depressed, and it's been a terrible year all round (for many of us), but I just ran my first sub 1:30 half marathon, and honestly? it feels amazing.","**Race Information**

* **Name:** Ryan's Half Marathon
* **Age:** 27
* **Date:** October 23, 2020
* **Distance:** 21.1 km
* **Location:** Battersea Park, London
* **Time:** 1:28:15

Hello again guys!

**Intro:**

So I recently lost a job I deeply truly loved due to the big C, and the feelings of worthlessness, self pity and general apathy have hit me like a freight train, running has been a safe constant during the last 6 months, the one thing keeping me 'moving', though I like to joke that I'm just really good at running away from my problems. That all culminated in a time trial today that has left me feeling good about myself for the first time in a while, but enough of a pity party here's the lowdown:

I began running at the start of April and managed some pretty quick noob gains; I posted back in August after hitting a sub 20 minute 5k, and got some good feedback about my goals which were a 40 minute 10k in September and a 1:30 half in October. (Generally this being increase easy distance + fast workouts, alongside some ""that's going to be really really tough, but good luck to you""). Still, I tapped into my masochistic side and decided to persevere in getting this done. I managed a 40:02 10k in September almost by accident - I had revised my expectations so just set a tempo on my watch of between 4:00 and 4:10 per km and wasn't too focused on the time, if I had been I definitely would have sprinted that last 100metres to knock the 2 seconds off! I know it's not officially sub 40, but it was a moral victory for me and I wanted to keep going for another 4 week cycle with a half marathon time trial at the end of it.

**Training:**

If you're interested in what a typical week looked like for the previous 3 weeks it consisted of 3 easy ish runs between 10km and 15km at around a 5:00/km pace, one long run of 18km+, one tempo run at half marathon pace that I gradually built up from 12km to 15km (this run gave me a LOT of confidence in my ability to smash the time trial), and intervals of either 10x500m with 45 second walk rest at 3:30/km or 6x1km with 90 seconds rest at 3:40/km (these were sorta with a >18:30 5k attempt next month in mind as well as hopefully making 4:16 pace seem *relatively* easy).

This week I tried to ease off my training, same number of easy runs but for shorter distances (and only a smallish tempo with no workouts). Yesterday I did a short run (for me) of 7km, but with 6 sets of strides to just wake my legs up.

**The Race:**

Honestly, pretty painful. I had a very good idea of the total distance around Battersea Park which is a little under 3km so knew 7 and a half laps would do the trick. A bit like my 10km PB I cheated a little by basically setting a workout on my watch of 21x1km with a pace aim of 4:10 to 4:15 per km, I know it's a bit naughty but honestly my pacing is awful, and this is hopefully something I can develop as I gain more experience running (the more I run, the more I realise 6 months is *nothing* in running terms). This helped massively and I'm honestly super proud of the median range of my splits, with the majority coming between 4:11 and 4:16 with only one 4:17 and one 4:18, I also threw in some quick km's at the start, and finished off the last 2 in 8 minutes so a great kick too!  I definitely knew I was good for the sub 1:30 but it was absolutely brilliant to see 1:28:15 pop up at the end, smashing my previous best of 1:36 something from early September (though that was a hilly route and I wasn't going utterly all out).

**Post-Race:**

Thankfully I had enough left in the tank for 3km jog home, but let me tell you, it was not fun. Otherwise today has been about relaxing and eating good food. I think I'll take tomorrow off then a really easy 15km run on Sunday to keep up my 70km+ weeks (more a point of pride than anything else). Up next as I mentioned will be a 5k in 4 weeks time, I tend to do my time trials in 4 week cycles alternating between 5,10 and 21.1 kilometres. I'm hoping after the next 3 month cycle I'll have times that fall relatively in line with a 3 hour marathon predictor, after which I'll work on increasing my distance and eventually get that Boston BQ late next year when hopefully Marathons are back!

Honestly I'm absolutely thrilled with how far I've come since I started running. I am not a naturally gifted sportsperson at all, my parents reaction was essentially ""are you sure it didn't glitch the distance? because you certainly didn't get any sports genes from us"". I'm proving others, and more importantly right now, myself wrong in what I can accomplish and it feels pretty good. I don't have many friends that can conceptualise what this result means, so I'm hoping a few of you lovely redditors might appreciate it!  


Edit:  Honestly I was not expecting a response like this, I want you guys to know I appreciate each and every one of you, for the upvotes, your comments and the awards, I've gone through a really tough time recently and to get this level of support from the community is so inspiring, I definitely have no choice but to keep running now!",running

So I was reminded of that moment and honestly wanted to read about your embarrassing moments so I don’t feel quite so bad. 

Mine was just at a local park. It has a crushed gravel trail around a lake, and during the week, especially in the mornings it is very remote and sparsely used. You can often see wildlife, and it’s nice to just put on your headphones and chuck away some miles. Well it was on one of these mornings where I was lost in a song, and found myself a little gassy. Well.... I was all alone in a remote park, so I passed gas over a number of strides and IMMEDIATELY was passed by an entire high school cross country team that was apparently out training, and they all had emphatic comments like.... “sweet”, “that was impressive”, “taco Tuesday?”, etc.

122,1613392573.0,Saved by pepper spray,"I've been running in my neighborhood for 15yrs and bitten by 5 dogs.  The last one was a vicious pit bull attack that left scars on my right arm.  After the attack, I purchased pepper spray gel for runners and always carry it.  Well, yesterday was the day.  The day I won.  The day a pitbull mix came after me and I was able to spray the dog at about 4 feet as it charged.  He shook off the first spray and came in for a second charge but this time I really got him in the mouth and eyes.   The owner came out during the commotion and was upset that I sprayed her dog.  She said, ""he just wants you to pet him"".  BS, as I said, I've been bitten 5 times so I know what it looks like when you're about to get munched on.  At this point, I lost it and started yelling at her about controlling her dog and if she can't control it she should own it.

If you have issues with dogs in your area, I highly recommend pepper spray gel.

Edit:  Wow.  I never expected this to blow up like this.  Interesting side note, every time I was bitten it was in a cul-de-sac and the owners were close by believing they had their dogs under control.  I believe part of the reason for the high number is the law of averages, I run 5 days per week and it's a 3.5-mile loop so I pass each house between 1-3 times depending on the run distance.  These dogs see 100's of times so when they get a chance to grab me they go for it :).   The pit bull that attacked me in the fall was put down for being a vicious dog - apparently, it had done it before.

2011 miles, four states, three pairs of shoes and one half marathon later, I want to share some of the things I’ve learned through this endeavor. 

Please share yours in the comments!

1. A year is a long time. 365 days is a lot of days.

2. Discipline is more effective than motivation. 

3. I have never regretted a run. 

4. Runners high is real. 

5. Sunscreen and Vaseline are important in the summer. Gloves are clutch in the winter. 

6. Goals and boundaries are important: no relationships or work have been irreparably harmed in the pursuit of this goal. 

7. Running in the rain isn’t so bad. Running in the cold rain is pretty bad. Running in the wind sucks. 

8. Very few people want to talk about running. In fact, even less than you’d expect. 

9. Many terrible seeming problems and conflict can be minimized with space and distance. 

10. Movement is integral to my mental health and happiness.",running

128,1622992814.0,I Ran A 5K Within 40 Minutes!,"A lot of people here can easily do this, but for me it’s a goal I’ve had since 2013. 

I’ve ran plenty of races, and all of them have been in the 40’s. I could never run the entire thing without walking a little. I include the treadmill and running at a park with decent elevation gain. Every time I’d focus on losing weight and improving my cardio, I’ve got serious about running. I’d sign up for a bunch of 5Ks, quarter marathons, and so on. I’d use them as motivation and do my best to get in shape for them, running some at the low 300’s (pounds), most of them between 250 and 300. I’ve completed the couch to 5K more times than I can even remember. 

My mom died in April of 2019 and I have my first child, a daughter, less than four months later. I stopped going to the gym immediately after she died. On the road trip to her funeral, I started drinking pop again after quitting for years and bought candy and snacks as we stopped at gas stations. I was 260 pounds. By the summer of 2020, I was 400 pounds, the highest recorded weight I’ve ever been.

I decided to get gastric sleeve surgery because I was terrified of not being there to raise my daughter and see her grow up. 

This time, I told myself I wasn’t going to sign up for any races, going at a comfortable pace, progressing on a timeline I could control. I started in March and could barely jog at 4mph, no incline on the treadmill, for 30 seconds. Every week, depending on how I felt, I would add 15-30 seconds to my run. 

Four weeks ago, I went to my first Orangetheory class. I’ve only gone once a week. I was nervous. In the weeks leading I was vomiting every day, had to run outside of the gym to vomit once. I showed up to the first class and three more. I am the fattest guy there but I don’t let that slow me down. Suddenly, my cardio was getting rapidly better. I can’t eat a lot of calories, so getting a good balance has been difficult. I found out I went from prediabetic to hypoglycemic, and that’s why I felt terrible. I’ve dropped my metformin as directed by my doctor and that’s taken away most symptoms but they still pop up with less severity.

Anyway, every week I’ve shaved a minute or more off of my time since I’ve started Orangetheory. I finally got a sub 40 5k. It was on the treadmill with an incline.

129,1619368891.0,"The joy of running broken,old and fat.","In October of 2018 my wife and I where informed by our daughter that she was going to run the Houston marathon.  I was 54 years old and 320 pounds. We were so proud of her determination to take on such an endeavor and decided we would drive down to see her cross the finish line in support. Becky and I had been talking about getting into running to better our health and shed a few pounds. We also decided to sign up for the Houston 5K that was to happen the morning the day before our daughter's marathon. We downloaded C25K. Our first day of using the C25K app left us winded and sore after logging a 32 minute mile walk. We persisted and on January 13 2018 we ran our first 5K along with thousands of other fellow pavement pounders. We finished in a time of 48 minutes and change. We decided to sign up for the half marathon in 2019. In September of 2018 I tore my meniscus on my right knee and had surgery to repair the damage. In January of 2019 we ran the Houston half marathon and finished in just under 4 hours. We have since logged numerous 5K runs both community and virtual, but have never bettered our time of 48 minutes. (danged covid) In May of 2019 I had a knee replacement of my right knee. After recovery and therapy we resumed our running and began a diet plan to get my weight off. Today I am 70 pounds lighter and this morning we decided to run a 5K distance at a local park trail where we run every Sunday. We pushed to get our time under 45 minutes and damned if we didn't do it. 44 minutes 49 seconds. I know that seems pretty pathetic in the eyes of some, but for me the accomplishment of that 5K time meant more to me than losing what weight I have over the last year. I hope to continue to improve and enjoy running with my wife until they have to put me down.",running

131,1591281501.0,Running doesn't suck; Being out of shape sucks.,"I think this was one of the main thoughts that turned me from a couch potato to a complete running addict, and I share it so that someone else may benefit. For me it proved to be subtle but powerful.

At my first football tryouts (in 6th grade), the coaches had us jog, maybe a half mile. After a lazy summer, it felt horrible. I thought what most people think when this happens: ""I want to avoid this situation as much as possible for the rest of my life."" There are two basic approaches to that. You can avoid physical activity as much as possible or you can embrace it so you are ready next time. I chose to embrace it. After every practice, I ran a lap around the field. When the season ended, I said that now's the time to stay in shape and continued working out. By 8th grade, I was so addicted to running that I did both XC and football practices back to back. The idea is that once one gets in shape, it's way easier to maintain than to fall off and get back on the wagon.

Has anyone else been through something similar?

Disclaimer: HIIT is tough no matter how in shape I get. I live in the Maffetone zone unless my day is really boring-then I crave the adversity and accomplishment feeling from HIIT.

Edit: Disclaimer #2 as a response to comments: There are people out there who are in shape and still don't like running. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that! I understand how this post might come off as discouraging, and that is the exact opposite of my intention. The main idea is that a lot more people would enjoy running if they gave it a proper chance by 1 getting through that first absolutely miserable phase of getting into shape 2 understanding good form and 3 pacing themselves. I think a more accurate statement would be ""Getting in shape is very hard, but staying in shape is very fun so long as you find an activity that you enjoy. Once in shape, you may find yourself loving activities that you used to hate. Also, don't go hard unless you feel like it or you feel like doing something that you don't feel like doing. You'll like any activity more that way"".

Some people disagree with this quote. Let me offer my interpretation--this isn't about walking around town with RUNNER across your chest. It's about how you talk to *yourself.* We all have those days where a run isn't what we want to do but if you've already conditioned yourself that you're a runner, guess what? You're going to lace up your sneakers, because that's what runners do. 
We all have different running goals. Mine are being healthy, looking good in shorts, being able to outrun a bad guy and refusing to go gently into my 40s. Do I have interest in running a marathon? Not really. I admire those who do but it isn't for me. I don't think I'm less than a runner for that. (It's all about outrunning a grizzly for me.)",running
133,1664145801.0,"An OWL grabbed my head while running, UPDATE ONE YEAR LATER","Hello r/running!

It's been awhile, so just in case you never read my two other posts, you can find them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/lfpwgx/a_hawk_grabbed_my_head_while_running_update_it/). Long story short, I live in an area known for aggressive/territorial owls. I run early in the morning and during the winter I have had to deal with owl swoopings/head grabs. I've been attacked a total of four times (twice actual contact, twice very close swoops). I was desperate for a solution and reached out to this community and the bird subreddit. 

A few users suggested sewing eyes on the back of my hat. I purchased giant googly eyes but honestly they were tough to adhere (I hot glued safety pins on the eyes then attached them to the hat) and a pain to take off when I wanted to wash the hat/not run with googly eyes. [Including a pic for your laughs.](https://imgur.com/a/YKIGu7X)

I thought this was just going to be my kind of annoying solution until my sister sent me [this mask](https://imgur.com/sNQ7yeJ) as a funny ha-ha-you-have-a-bizarre-owl-problem joke. 

Well joke's on her because the mask was exactly what I needed!! With it's easy elastic band and flimsy plastic front the [mask easily fits on the back of my head.](https://imgur.com/bpamMp9) It's also easy to remove so if I'm on a long run that seeps into daylight I can take it off instead of being that weirdo runner lady with the backwards mask on. And you know what?? IT WORKS. I started wearing the mask in September/October of last year and I haven't been attacked by an owl since. I was [just featured](https://westseattleblog.com/2022/09/reader-report-one-solution-for-deterring-swooping-owls/) on my local blog about my solution.

A big thank you to everyone for coming up with some great ideas like peeing on the owl to mark my territory, making sure I'm not a Disney Princess and moving. 

A big F U to everyone who told me to watch the HBO show The Staircase because the scene with the owl WAS SO TRIGGERING. Also maybe that was a crazy aggressive owl but in the 4 times I've encountered one they hit then fly away so yeah he def killed her.

134,1597064887.0,Yesterday I ran my first half marathon and since they were all cancelled my family and friends made me a “finish line.” I feel like I’m floating with joy,"Two years ago I had some pretty severe postpartum depression. I started to train for a 5k and little by little I started to feel alive again. I completely came off my medication and now I enjoy life with my son. Flash forward to when COVID hit and I needed something to look forward to so I signed up for a half marathon!

It’s been an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling process for me but I was so disappointed when every race in my area was cancelled due to COVID. Instead of cancelling or waiting until next year, I decided to make my own route and do it alone. I told my friends and family and they all came together to make me a “finish line.” 

The run itself was my hardest run because it was so hot and humid. I wanted to quit so many times because I felt like I could faint at any moment and my hamstring was so tight but I just kept focusing on everyone I loved waiting for me and how 2 years ago I really didn’t want to live anymore but here I am today doing the hardest thing I’ve ever done.

As soon as I turned the corner and saw my son and the people I love most waiting for me I burst into tears. I never expected to feel so accomplished and elated in this process but it has brought me so much joy and fulfillment. 

I was shooting for an under 2 hour time, but I finished at 2:15 with an average pace of 10”25. I am still proud of this time though because it was by far my hottest and hardest long distance run!

I could already feel my pace picking up simply because I didn't have to fight harder to keep cool.

136,1529888235.0,Acknowledge Fat Runners,"In November of 2016, I went to the doctor for a minor sickness. As one does at the doctors office, I stepped on the scale. 299 pounds. I was speechless. Not because I was shocked I was fat, I knew I was. I was simply overcome by the fact that the next time weighed myself, I’d likely weigh over 300 pounds. 

I promised myself that would never happen. I changed my diet and started walking. I walked all winter. Dropping the first 20 pounds was pretty easy, but I ran into a wall at 280. As the snow here in Indianapolis started to melt, I decided to start running. 

My first attempt I made it less than a quarter of a mile. I was gasping, my knees hurt, wanted to quit. I walked 100 yards and ran again. Over the next couple of months, with the help of my wife, Ashlee, I started running longer and longer distances. 

I can’t tell you how intimidating it was to venture out on greenways and trails with “real” runners. Everyone seemed so fit, so effortless, so powerful. Being fat and jumping into running around others can feel really lonely. 

Being acknowledged made all the difference. As I gasped along the Monon Trail here in Indy, I noticed something special: complete strangers pulling for me. Sometimes it came in the form of “hey keep it up” or “good job runner”, but usually, it was simply making eye contact and a quick smile. It meant the world. It made me feel part of something. It made me want to be a runner. Runners are kind, generous people who want others to excel and grow. At least, that’s my experience. But hey, I’m a runner so maybe I’m biased :) 

As the summer wore on, the pounds dropped off. In October 2017 I ran my first 13.1 in 2:17. In January 2018, I got down to my current weight of 235 and ran my first sub 2 (1:59:53) in Chicago at the F^3. In March, I hit my current PR of 1:54:57 at the Carmel Half Marathon. 

My big goal this year is to break 1:45 and complete my first marathon in November in 4 hours. 

I’m not a fat runner anymore, just a chubby one on my way to crushing my fitness goals. 

I probably wouldn’t be anywhere close to where I am today if it weren’t for the existence of kind strangers who had the empathy to look me in the eye and believe in me.

147,1596814154.0,I just ran my first sub 10 minute mile!,"6’3” 295lbs. This morning I did my usual routine of waking up at 4am and dreading getting out of bed. I finally got up and started getting ready and began to feel pretty good. Decided I would do something different today.

I’ve been running since the end of March. I started doing it because the gyms were closed and I’ve avoided cardio like the plague so I wanted to get better at it. Also I was finally recovered enough from my second ACL surgery that I felt comfortable running outside. For the first 2 months I would just go out and run hard and get exhausted after 45 seconds and then grind out the rest of the run, usually ending my runs with low 13 or high 12 minute miles. 

I started to get better but I never really had a goal or plan. After chatting with coworkers I learned that I should do different types of runs like shorter, longer, quicker, or slower. I did that for a while and ran my first 5k ever in about 39:00. I was pretty happy but still knew I had a lot of improvement ahead of me.

I eventually started using the NRC app and wow. That completely changed my mindset. I learned that running could be relaxing, enjoyable, and even fun! With slowing down I actually started getting faster and faster. This totally blew my mind. I was always looking at everything as a sprint type of thing, “if I don’t run fast at the beginning, I’m not running hard enough.” Well I’m so happy I’ve realized this and the guided runs have been a huge help.

Back to this morning. I got ready, stretched and went outside. Turned on my music (Run The Jewels if anyone was wondering). I decided to see how fast I could run a mile. I started running very slow for a quick little warm up and then turned on my app timer. While running I felt pretty good about .4 miles into it but definitely started hitting that part where your brain just keeps telling you to stop. I thought back to some stuff I learned and did a maintenance check. First focused on my breathing, then my shoulders, arms, legs, and feet. I felt better once I calmed myself down and started to pick it up a little again. I ran for a while longer and then looked down and saw that I was at .83 miles, almost there! I focused and pushed until I heard the app say, “Distance: 1 Mile, Pace: 9 minutes and 32 seconds.”

151,1603180680.0,Hit by a truck on my morning run. Lucky to still be here. Please be smarter than me and be safe. Your life can be taken away in a matter of seconds.,"Last Thursday I put on my running shoes for an easy 10 mile recovery run. I was especially tired that morning as I was coming off another high mileage week and I wasn’t getting great sleep as a result of a stressful work week.

I left my house and prepared to cross the only major intersection on my typical route. As I looked to my right I saw a steady line of traffic on the other side of the road. I looked to my left and didn’t see any incoming cars. It was still dark out as it was just before 6 AM.
As I waited for the last car to pass from the line of cars I entered the intersection. I then heard a loud screech and looked to my left and saw big bright headlights.
I tried to retract back to the sidewalk but did not make it in time.

The truck swerved and hit me with the front end of his bumper. The collision sent me rolling  and skidding on the asphalt. I got up quickly and made my back to the sidewalk. I stood on the sidewalk hunched over trying to figure out mentally what had just happened. I was in complete shock, however, I was. not unconscious or disoriented. Once I recollected myself, all I could think about was all gear (watch, hat, phone) laying in the street about to get run over. The driver of the vehicle got out to ask if I I was okay and told me he called the cops.

It seemed like hours but the cops finally showed up. They told me to walk about 500 feet to sit down on a bench so I could give distance between myself and the driver and wait for an ambulance. This was a terrible idea. Up until that point I hadn’t moved an inch and stood like a statue hunched over. The hip pain was unbearable and my foot was a bloody mess but somehow the adrenaline got my legs to move and I made my way to the bench. The ambulance arrived and I was rushed to the hospital. 

I received x rays and a CT scan. Outside of some lacerations and road rash I had 1 broken toe and a bruised hip bone. My foot did get ripped up pretty bad as you can see in the link below and my Boston’s were shredded in half.
My body was bruised and swollen but I did not have any serious or life threatening injuries. 

When I say I’m lucky to be alive I do not say that lightly. The driver was going 50 in a 45 and driving a Ford F-350. Had the driver not swerved upon seeing me enter the intersection he would have hit me head on and most likely killed me. In that split second he reacted and saved my life.

Now on to the embarrassing things I am ashamed to admit. I didn’t wear reflective gear that morning. Actually my clothes were dark.
I did not thoroughly check both sides before crossing. I did not get enough sleep the night before and as a result started my run groggy and seemingly half asleep. All of these poor decisions compounded into what could have been a fatal mistake. As a result I would have left behind my wife, my three year old son and a three month old baby. 

Being that close to death shook me to my core. I haven’t slept well since leaving the hospital. I close my eyes and see the headlights coming at me. I know we all hear these stories and think “oh that dumb runner or cyclist!” It’s almost as if it makes us feel better thinking of them as dumb so we can rationalize us being smarter than that and never making these mistakes. But now I AM the dumb runner who made the mistake that could have cost me my life.

My plea in all this is to just be smart. Wear reflective gear, get good sleep so you can be sharp mentally, avoid listening to music with cars around and always look both ways. I feel like I get a second chance at life again so I want to share this to help people not make the same mistakes I made. As for now I will be recovering and preparing myself for the day I will once again hit the roads. Pictures of my accident are below (blood alert) and a link to my activity of the run on Strava. Stay safe!

152,1618780027.0,Was wholesomely “catcalled” today,"Obligatory not really a catcall but what I was bracing for. 

So it’s spring and getting warmer so I wear shorts and a sports bra for most of my runs. Running seems hard enough without having an extra piece of sweaty fabric clinging to me. Plus I always used to run mostly in a rural area with not much traffic so I never thought about what I wore except what would be the most comfortable. But, I’ve moved to a busier spot so my normal warm weather running outfits get more comments than I’m used to. I’ve been averaging about one catcall per run since it’s gotten warm out, which isn’t too bad given what some have to deal with, but not what I was used to. I try not to let it bother me too much. Mostly I try to view it as entertainment for my group chat as in “you’ll never guess what someone said today!”

So today, when a car in the other lane started to slow down and the man rolled down his window, I braced myself for the inevitable sexualized comment coming. But instead, he said, “you’re doing great! Keep it up!” and gave me a thumbs up. I actually smiled and felt myself pick up the pace! The one comment actually made me feel better for the rest of my run rather than tense and on guard! I just felt so grateful someone took the chance to lift someone up rather than put them down with their comments so I wanted to share!",running
153,1610490999.0,"I improved my mile time by 30 seconds (8:10 to 7:40) by running at an 11 min/mi pace for the past few months. I thought you guys were joking when you said running more miles at a slower pace is what improves your times, but I was wrong!!","I've been a lurker on this sub for the past few months since I took up running as a hobby this summer. Prior to that I only ran what was required of me in middle and high school PE

When I first began running I read through tons of comments on here looking for advice on how to get faster, everyone just said, ""Run more, at an easy pace.""

I honestly thought you guys were all just playing a joke on me, because in the past I'd spent years in high school trying to improve my mile time just by doing random sprint or HIIT drills in some futile effort to get faster. Nothing worked so after maintaining around an 8:10 mile PR since my freshman year in high school I just accepted that was my mile time, and that I probably wouldn't be faster unless I lost some weight to be lighter. This is what happened previously when I lost about 15lbs and my time went from 9:50 min/mi to 8:10 min/mi in high school, so I thought if I lost 15lbs more I could improve my time again.

But the past month I actually listened to what people said on here. I've been running SUPER slowly, at what sometimes feels like a snail pace or a granny jog around 11 min/mi. But what made the difference was that at this pace, I began to be able to put in more time actually running! 

The slower I went, the longer I could sustain my pace, and the better I got at being able to go up hills without stopping to walk. I found that as soon as I began focusing on ""how long can I run for"" and trying to increase my endurance, my mileage during those periods of running naturally increased. So I was able to put down 3mi in 33 min rather than 2.7mi in 33 min, and over time I got slowly faster and improved my endurance.

I didn't lose any weight, and actually gained a couple pounds these past few months, so it wasn't me being lighter that made me a better runner. It was just spending more time running :)

I just wanted to post this because I was actually shocked at this huge improvement in my time. I feel that next time I go for a new record I will actually be able to break this PR, because I slowed down a bit toward the end when I could have kept pushing.

Thanks to everyone on here that gives advice, and I'm sorry that I thought you guys were joking for so long!",running

157,1640220480.0,A year ago today I ran a marathon on zero days of training and it put me in the hospital through Christmas.,"Long Version:  

I’ve been a runner my whole life, including a D3 National Qualifier in Track. In my mid 20s, after the horrific Boston Marathon Bombing, I decided to get into marathons. I ran one a year starting in 2013, totaling 9 completed marathons through 2019 including Boston twice and a PR in Chicago at 2:53. 

When the pandemic hit in 2020, I had let the year slip away and had not completed nor even trained for a marathon. I told my wife I was going to just wake up one morning and run it, no training, even if I had to go slowly. Even if it took me all day.  I was out of time and I had to just go for it. 

So on December No22nd, 2020,  I woke up early and ran the first half of the marathon through my town and local state park arriving back to my house for the halfway mark, some Gatorade, GUs, and an adorable sign from my daughter. I remarked to my wife that I couldn’t believe how great I felt. 

The second half went as most of my marathons have, getting progressively harder each mile leading up to the finish. The last 5 miles I pushed my daughter in her jogging stroller and was able to cross the finish line having just run a sub 4 hour marathon on zero days of training. I was blown away! I celebrated with a beer and a cookie just as if I had crossed a real finish line. I couldn’t believe what I had just accomplished! 

As the day progressed I started feeling more and more lethargic and barely had the energy by dinner to even enjoy my celebratory burger. My wife asked what was wrong and I told her (being that I’m an ICU nurse and had a pretty good idea) that it was quite possible I was in rhabdomylosis and that my kidneys were shutting down. (Rhabdo is when muscle tissue breaks down and releases a protein called myoglobin which then in turn damages the kidneys.) This was the straw that broke the anxious camel’s back, and she begged me to go to the ER. I decided she was probably right and so I drove myself, around 11pm, into the local ER. 

After arriving in the emergency department, with adrenaline now coursing through many veins, I was convinced I was actually just fine and that I didn’t need to be there, but agreed to stay for some IV fluids and blood tests.  When the ER doc returned with the results he said we had made the right call and sure enough I was in rhabdomylosis and had an acute kidney injury. I spent the next 3 nights getting constant IV fluids trying to flush out my kidneys and avoid total kidney failure and dialysis. 

The amount of IV fluid it required to flush my kidneys led to severe edema (swelling) and pleural effusions (water at the base of my lungs). Despite all this my kidney function began improving by the afternoon on Christmas and I was discharged that night. 

Lesson learned. Always train for a marathon.",running

Where as in the cold, I can always layer up. And I find it motivational, cause if you stop running in freezing temperatures, you’ll probably just die. So you gotta keep moving. The air when it’s cold is nice and crisp, almost refreshing.

159,1599145038.0,1st time running without a shirt,"I 28F have been running for the past 4 years on a regular basis, and I really love it. I was never overweight, but had a soft stomach. Even now after 4 years of lifting/running, my stomach is still the softest part of me, and I've always been a little self conscious about it. I also have 3 scars on my stomach where i had surgery when I was younger.

Yesterday was another humid day in Georgia. I met one of my running partners downtown on the beltline, which is a crowded trail in the city. When we got out of the car, I removed my shirt, leaving just a sports bra and shorts on. We walked to the trail, passed a few restaurants. Not going to lie, i was feeling self conscious and exposed. One lady was standing on the side walk and she looked me in the eyes, then she looked at my stomach. For some reason, it actually made me feel good. Made me feel like she was admiring my stomach and my confidence!

So we get to the trail and off I go. I play some amazing music, pass other runners, im feeling great! And when i finished running, I felt so good feeling the sweat roll down my stomach, no hot wet shirt attaching to me. I felt free. I felt self love. I didnt care about people looking at me, I was feeling so good it didnt even matter!

I went running again today shirtless and will continue to do this until the weather changes. Next step will be shirtless in the gym.

160,1606071741.0,Losing 100 Pounds With Running,"On December 22nd 2019, I told my parents that I was going to complete a half marathon in 2020. At the time, I was 266.6 pounds at 6'. They were very supportive and loving, but (rightfully so), I think they were  skeptical. I chose running because it was the one thing I was the worst at. I couldn't do it for any extended period of time, I hated the way I looked while running, and I hated how my lungs burned. By challenging myself to do the thing I was worst at, I wanted to prove that I could do ""anything"". My first run was January 1st 2020, and I was on Week 1 Day 1 of C25K. I nearly vomited after only ONE minute of running. My fitness was absolutely horrific, and I turned that disgust for myself into motivation. Despite shin splints due to my weight, I continued pushing with running (taking a month off to heal) while continuing to lose weight. This morning, (10 months later) I completed an 8 mile run for my half-marathon training plan. My race is December 13th, and I am 169 pounds. I wanted to share this so that people in my situation know that it can be done, because I was very skeptical about my chances of success in the early stages. Thanks for reading!

He didn't care about my pace. He didn't care about the shoes I wore, or my race times and distances, or how long I've been a runner. He saw my dedication of getting out five days a week for months on months to pound the pavement and respected that.

Anyone who's been around runnit for a while sees Those posts from beginners. You know the ones; they're laden with fear of judgment and ""am I a real runner if my pace is slow?"" But the reality is, you're the only one who knows you're ""slow."" Everyone watching just sees a runner, and the vast majority have zero idea of what your pace is and if it's ""good."" What they actually notice is that you're out day after day, building the dedication to taking care of yourself and reaching your goals.

(In fact, the only time I ever got a comment on my pace, it was a hearty ""look at you! Taking it at a nice easy pace! That's how you stick with it."") 

That's my rant of the day. Yeah, I'm a ""slow"" runner, and I'm not going to put any caveats on that. I'm slow. I don't need to justify it, because I get out there consistently, to better myself and take care of my mental and physical health, and that's something to be respected as much as any winning race time.

164,1658709642.0,Young eyes are always watching.,"So tonight on a 4 mile recovery run in 90 degree weather, I ran past 3 young girls (two were around 6 or 7 and one younger, around 4).

“I’m running” I replied with a big smile. She locked eyes with me and asked why. 
I had a moment to respond, without breaking a stride I said “ because it makes me feel good! I’m running 4 miles!” 
She was shocked and said “four miles!! Wow!” She was smiling as I ran away.

I don’t know it just felt so good. What if that small interaction sticks with her? If it makes her want to join a cross country or track team in school? Or pick up running when she is stressed in young adulthood?

166,1607543778.0,Thick Girl Runner Rant,"First things first, I (29F) am 5'5"" and about 170 lbs.  Large boobs, wide hips, and I got some stomach on me.  Overall, I look pretty proportional though.  Hourglass, just a little wider.  Wear a Large or a size 12 in most women's clothes.  (Just trying to paint the picture here lol)

I also eat very healthy.  Fresh foods only, everything home-cooked, never frozen processed foods, etc.  Mostly veggies because I love veggies.

This is the body I was given.  My weight doesn't really fluctuate.  I don't gain weight easily, nor do I lose it easily.  I've been a thick girl since puberty and because I run often and eat healthy, it doesn't seem like that will never change, which is fine with me.

I've been running for many years, somewhat inconsistently.  I might be consistent for 2 years before falling out of my routine for a few months.  Get back into the groove again and something eventually throws me off my game again.  Throughout all this, I still consider myself a RUNNER.  I love the sport and even if I'm out of a weekly routine, I still try to find time to run here and there.  3 miles minimum.

Because of the above things, people never really expect me to be a runner.  My body type doesn't fit the runner mold.  I don't post every run and race on instagram, which as everyone knows, is what truly makes it real \*eyeroll\*.  (No shade to people who do post all of their runs and races!  My problem is only the people who think if you DON'T post, then it didn't happen).

My fastest 5k was at an 8:02 (min/mile) pace.  I am aware that this isn't SUPER fast, but it's fast enough that I've placed in my age group in all of the 5Ks I've ever done.  I'm from a pretty small area so many of the 5Ks were fairly small, maybe only a couple hundred people attend.  I'm aware that in bigger cities, I would probably have a little more trouble placing.  But regardless, I still think an 8:00 to 8:30 5k pace is something to be proud of.

Anyways, my complaint is this.  Since my body doesn't fit everyone's vision of what a runner should look like, people love to assume I'm slow or new to running.  Or people think I'm lying when I mention that I got 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in my age group at whatever 5k.  If they don't make an actual comment about it, I can sometimes even see it in their eyes that they're skeptical.

Even worse, people who don't realize I've been running for most of my life sometimes put their foot in their mouth by saying something along the lines of ""have you started running to lose weight?"" ...No, why?  Should I be losing weight?  I think I look pretty damn fine, if you ask me.

After moving to a new city, I decided to join a running group.  The town I lived in previously didn't have such groups.  I showed up to my first group run and met everybody.  As we waited for everyone else to show up, a girl from the group said to me ""I'm in recovery mode, I'll be running slow so I can run with you.""  I just politely smiled, although I was quite offended.  What exactly makes this person, whom I met 3 minutes ago, think I plan on running ""slow""?  What makes her think that her ""recovery"" pace is equal to my comfortable pace?  I chalked it up as since it was my first time joining the group, maybe she assumed it was my first time running?  I don't know- but I still think about that little comment sometimes.

I am not negative towards my body.  I have a great figure that I love, but it's still upsetting to know that people make assumptions on what I can and can't do physically, which should not be the case.  Weight and health do not ALWAYS go hand-in-hand.

&#x200B;

Any other runners on the thicker side experience this kind of judgement?  How do you deal with it?

Thin-framed runners or even non-runners, do you find yourself judging others in this way?  Be honest, I would love to hear multiple opinions!

27, F, fat (but shrinking, ever-so-slowly)

In March, I picked up running because I simply couldn’t bear to sit inside my apartment any more while quarantining. And by running, I mean mostly walking while forcing myself to jog for a minute at a time, and occasionally bending over to hack up half a lung. 

I’m still not great now, but I run 3-4 times a week, averaging 3-4 miles each time. Still run/walk intervals, but more running than walking, and my pace has gone from about a 21:00 mile (hardly faster than walking) to about 16:00, although it dips closer to 13:00 when I’m really feeling myself. Nowhere near the elite folks you see in this sub, but a far cry from the kid who couldn’t run a full mile in high school.

When I started running, I laced up a clearance pair of Adidas I’d bought at Marshall’s months prior and tossed in my closet. They sucked - it felt like there was nothing between me and the pavement, which I hated, and they pinched my toes something awful - but the pain in my chest and legs was always worse, so I could tune it out. Not the case anymore; I can run long and steady enough that when I got a groove going, it would be my foot pain that would make me slow down, and it got to a point where it was unbearable for any longer.

So, despite being terrified of being judged for being a fatty in a running store, I sought out some help in finding a better pair at a local storefront, and the experience was gamechanging! It was so helpful, I learned a lot, and for the first time in about 6 months, I’m actually excited to run (rather than begrudgingly lacing up because I know it’s good for me). After trying on about 10 pairs - all of which fit better than my existing pair - I ended up leaving with a pair of amazingly comfy Hoka One One Bondi 7’s, and a pair of custom insoles - I couldn’t help but chuckle to myself realizing that I’d never believe it if you told me 5 years ago that I’d drop $230 at a running store. 

I went for a very easy run when I got home - just 2 miles, between 15:00 and 16:00 mile pace - and OH MY GOD. What??? I was faster without even trying? My stride feels longer? It actually felt like I was running on magical trampoline clouds? And best of all: my feet didn’t hurt at all!! I just wanted to keep going, which has never, ever happened; I felt like I was completely and totally jazzed - is this the mysterious runner’s high I keep hearing about? 

Thanks for reading my nonsense ramblings, but I’m just so happy and excited to actually enjoy running - is this what people go nuts about? Because I’m completely sold.",running

171,1615552305.0,If you're considering running. Go for it,"Running is NOT always fun. I used to watch runners and think ""how do they love running so much?"". The thing is, sometimes, runs are rubbish, they hurt, getting motivation to go isn't always easy, and at times the elements outside can knock you off course. I've been running for a couple of years now and am as self critical as when I first started.

That is why I have a MASSIVE amount of respect for ANYONE who runs. Especially those starting out, on their 1st week of couch to 5k etc. To put yourself out there takes bravery and courage. For some it will take a great effort just to quiet those inner voices of self doubt, worries about what others will think. Dont let those thoughts beat you.

When I first began running my back ached within the first minute, and I barely made it through my first run despite it being mostly walking. At the time I was also dealing with one of the toughest emotional times in my life. It is all too easy to get demotivated.

But I hopefully speak for all runners when I say that if you're getting out there, starting off on your running journey, no matter what you think you might look like, how unfit you think you are, what troubles you're dealing with, I personally think you are awesome and my message to you is DO NOT GIVE UP. You can do it!

Because I have not once got back from a run and regretted it. I've explored, got lost, discovered the wonders of nature (even locally) got muddy like a kid again, met some lovely people on the way, and feel really good and positive about life.

Its not always easy  everyone is on their own journey and life can be tough sometimes. But for anyone who's thinking of running, I say be kind to yourself, be brave and go for it.",running
172,1595550739.0,"Please, appreciate every run you're able to take.","I'm a big guy.5'11, 230 pounds.

Due, in large part, to the fact that I stopped running for a year when I was 20. After that, I got shin splints every time I tried to get back into it. 1 or 2 attempts a year. Shin splints every time. My body couldn't keep up with my mental game, and I'd run myself into the ground.

So when COVID hit, I decided to do something I always knew would fix it, but had a serious mental block against. Stubborn.In order to build my legs back up from a sedentary lifestyle, I walked. For 3 months, I went on a long walk 5 times a week.

My first run was in May.2 miles. I wanted to do more, but I was cautious. I limited myself to about 12 miles/week.Sometimes I'd run 3 miles, and even had some nice 4 milers. I'd just walk for a bit when I noticed my form breaking down. I'd get home from long runs feeling rough, but satisfied.

Today, I ran 3.55 miles with no walking, and experienced something that I forgot existed - or at least forgot how insanely powerful it could be.

It had been so long. I didn't even recognize it at first. I thought ""woah, easy there tiger, don't want to go up too high and crash"".

But the smile on my face just wouldn't go away. Then the realization of what was happening crashed over me like a wave. I almost cried happy tears mid stride, because I was experiencing a true, uninhibited runner's high for the first time **in over 7 years**.

The  feeling of pure freedom and oneness with the present moment was truly breathtaking.

I've gone through so much pain as an adult. Depression, alcoholism, suicidal ideation. The list goes on. All of that has honestly warped me as a person. As a kid, I never understood why adults always looked so....guarded. As an adult, I've often envied how kids look so....free - not bowed over with the weight of all their failures, not insulated from hurt by walls thicker than fort knox.

Today, I remembered how kids do it - how I used to do it. I ran home unashamed of the goofy smile plastered across my face.

I am so insanely grateful to be able to feel this again. I hope that you guys can appreciate your ability to run.

And if you're injured, or often get injured, take this bit of advice: the thing that might fix it is often the last thing you want to do. If I'd just taken 3 months to walk when I was 21, I'd probably never have forgotten what a runner's high feels like.",running

It’s hard for me to feel happy, that’s just how I’ve always been, but lately I’ve been trying to take more time to pay attention to wins.

What are some things you guys do to celebrate wins?

EDIT: Thank you, everyone!!! You guys made me smile a ton and gave some great ideas for celebrating and for how to enjoy wins. I’m grateful for this community :)",running
174,1586273112.0,Are there things you wish you knew before you started running? What are they? Here's my comprehensive list.,"Feel free to comment your best tips and advice guys. This is for the greater good of the running community. Let's compile our best personal advice, tips, insights and experiences. 

Here's a list of things I wish someone told me 4 years ago before i started running: 

1. Combining running and walking is an awesome way to build your endurance... ESPECIALLY at the BEGINNING of your running journey. 


2. Running consistently over weeks and months matter so much more in terms of improvements in racing performance rather than the specific paces and distances you run during ur training. The time on your feet will add up. You can literally keep using the same training schedule and not change the frequency, paces and distances for ur runs and you will still keep improving and getting fitter for another 4-8 weeks. 


3. It's better to take a week off from running to let a small injury or strain fix itself rather than running through it and end up not running for a month or few months because you made it worse.


4. Eat more, be in a slight calorie surplus, sleep well (deeply), drink a lot of water, take multivitamins and follow the protein guidelines for athletes, which is eating roughly 1.2-2 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. Do EVERYTHING you can to recover. 


5. Running is a high-impact sport, we'll need everything we can to help our bones and muscles to recover. I weigh 70 kilograms (154 lbs). That means each of my legs need to support  AT LEAST 70 kilograms (686 Newtons) of force every time they hit the ground and since I take 180 steps per minute during my runs, you can already tell that the strain experienced by our legs add up very quickly when we run. So it's very important that we do everything we can to recover. 


6. Fixing your running form as EARLY as you can is important to preventing injuries and becoming more efficient. If your feet land on your heels at each step, you'll be more prone to knee injuries. If your torso swings too much when you run, you'll wind up wasting too much energy. If your shoulders (trapezius specifically) are too tight, you'll be wasting energy too. Find a way to record yourself running on a treadmill, and get a coach, physio or an experienced runner to comment on your form and ask them for areas of improvement. 


7. If one of your legs is more powerful/stronger than the other and you're not careful enough, your stronger leg will be doing most of the work and taking most of the force when u run. This means that one leg will become more prone to getting injured. You can fix this by adding UNILATERAL (one-leg) leg exercises like lunges, step-ups and one-leg glute bridges to your routine which will help strengthen your weaker leg overtime and prevent a lot of muscle-imbalance related injuries. Not to mention strong quads = less knee pain. 


8. Core exercises like front planks, side planks and supermans prevent your torso from rotating or swinging too much while running. This will help you waste less energy and become more efficient when you run. (A strong core will also help fix most lower back pain problems) 


9. Dynamic stretches after every run increase the flexibility of your joints and also stops your muscles, tendons and joints from becoming too stiff. Helps prevents a lot of tightness-related injuries. 


10. Adding push-ups, pull-ups, rows and overhead presses will help you gain FUNCTIONAL strength and enough muscle to look ripped without slowing you down. If anything, we can argue that they're helpful to our running because these exercises actuallly indirectly train our core and other stabiliser muscles. 


11. Add cross-training. Mix up your training with some cycling, hiking, swimming, rowing or any endurance sport. You'll still get aerobic, endurance and stamina benefits from them because the physiological demands are similar. Keep in mind though, that if your focus is running, make sure most of your training revolves around running. 


12. You won't lose fitness by missing out on one session, but you will start to lose it after not running for two weeks in a row. 


13. Monitoring ur heart rate first thing in the morning is a good way to check if you've been overtraining or if you're about to get sick. If it's more than 10 beats per minute higher than your resting heart rate, feel free to take a day off 

14. If you didnt sleep well the night before, didnt eat well, drink enough water or felt really really stressed throughout the day... fell free to take the day off from running. 


15. Long-Distance runners still need to be decent at sprinting. If ur racing competitively, you wanna be the guy with the most devastating final sprint or 'kick' at the end of any race. It also looks cool and dramatic in a very very good and epic way.


16. Joining a running club or creating your own running group makes running so much more fun, relaxing and emnjoyable...


17. Unless if running is your designated personal alone time 😂

18. Running without music and just listening to ur footsteps, the wind, the birds and your environment is very therapeutic. 


19. If your goal is to run a specific time for a specifc distance, make sure that your training is specific to that goal. For example, let's say you're goal is to run a 5k in 25 minutes. 


You're training should focus on: 


- Becoming comfortable with running for 25 minutes at a time on a regular basis


- Becoming comfortable with running at 5:00/km which is the pace you need to break 25 minutes for 5k 


In this case you're training schedule can look like 


Mon:   30 minute run (easy-moderate pace)
Wed:   30 minute run (easy-moderate pace)
Sat  :   Warm-up jog + 5x 1km intervals at 5:00/km pace with 5 minutes rest in between


You can rest or add cross training on the four other days of the week. 


For the Saturday interval session, try to slowly shorten your rest periods between intervals as you get fitter. Maybe take 4 minutes 30 seconds rest next week, and then only 4 minutes the week after. 


TRAIN HARD but TRAIN SMARTER 


That's all. I love this sport and our community. I've become much faster and smarter than I was 4 years ago. I've had drawbacks. I couldnt run in 2019 because of an injury. But I'm glad I can save you guys time by sharing these lessons I've learnt along the way. 

I've gone from dying after running for 200 metres (March 2016) to running an 18:05 5k in October 2018 (17 years old). I'm probably in sub 18-shape now (19 years old), started running again from scratch on December last year. But eventually I want to see how fast I can get before the 2032 Olymp...😉

HAPPY RUNNING Y'ALL :-))",running
175,1653352512.0,I feel like I unlocked a running secret for myself!,"I'm currently overweight and like to run for exercise. In the past, I always tried to run a mile and then promptly quit after one mile and obsessively looked at my fitibit while running to see how close I was to a mile the entire time.

For whatever reason after picking up running again last week, I decided to put my Playlist on shuffle and run for 5 songs instead of a mile.

Every single time now I always run a little over a mile and this method has helped me so much! As I get more fit, I hope to eventually up it to 10 songs!",running
176,1600558593.0,"(21f) Constantly harassed on runs, what to do?","Haven’t ran in a few days and currently eating sweet tarts sitting on my lazy ass. I live in TX and run in leggings and a sports bra. It seems every time I run some man or group of men (usually landscapers) will do the extreme. Howl, yell, honk, etc. 

The worst experience I had was landscapers run and chase me from the other side of the street while yelping. Disgusting. Made me want to throw up and was scared. I’m not confrontational esp against 15 men or men inside their big ol trucks but on the inside I’m crying. 

I have too much anxiety to go out. It’s not just running, it happens when I walk my dog or anytime I’m not with my SO. SO doesn’t understand the depth of it since he’s never been cat called. 

Truth be told when I was fat and depressed a year back, I got less attention. So my child brain is thinking how to look disgusting as possible to not attract any attention? The adult brain is here asking for advice that’s non treadmill related. 


Thank you.",running
177,1599084018.0,37F here - a rando dude made my night run,"I live in a big city and I like to run alone at night. I find I don’t get harassed nearly as much at night simply because there are fewer people around to do the harassing. Plus, night runs were my salvation during hottest part of this bizarre pandemic summer. Running through the dark city makes my world feel a little bigger and my problems feel a little smaller. 

I was out for a run and saw another runner, a pretty big man, coming towards me. I’ve never had issues with fellow runners so I wasn’t nervous, but I try to keep my wits about me whenever any unknown person is approaching and I’m aIone. 

As he passed, he quietly gestured 🤙 and ran on. 

It was the absolute perfect way to say “fuck yeah, nice job” — the perfect way to acknowledge me without making me feel weird or second guess the interaction. I didn’t feel intruded upon, hit on, or pressured to respond. I felt seen in a way that didn’t make me feel vulnerable. I smiled for the rest of my run. 

Thanks man. 🤙",running

180,1601574307.0,Please don’t take for granted being able to run,"Hi guys! 

My name is Jacob, I’m a 21 year old guy in the prime of my life. Or so I thought. I was running a lot back when this pandemic started, upwards of doing 50-60 miles a week and absolutely loving it. I did cross country in high school and always had a knack for running. I would do half marathons for fun just by myself and I was so excited to use this pandemic as a time to improve even more. 

But then... I got pleurisy. Basically what pleurisy is is the muscles along the inside of your lungs get inflamed and it’s really painful/hard to get a deep breath, which of course halted my running. This happened back in June I was diagnosed. So I haven’t been able to run since June with serious lung issues. 

And now it is fall, the perfect running weather and no better time to get the shoes on and hit the road. My lungs are feeling a little better and I thought it would be time to ease back into running. Nope.

I sustained a concussion last week and am out for at least another few weeks until I can even think about running. 

So please, don’t take for granted being able to run. Enjoy it while you can because I’m jealous of all you guys who can run during this gorgeous fall weather. 

Thanks for reading this far :) 

Tl/dr: got pleurisy in June, a lung issue which stopped me from running. When I started to feel better I got a concussion. Don’t know if I can run at all the rest of the fall. Please, enjoy your runs for me.

I run to lose weight, improve cardiovascular function and for my mental health. The only problem is, I am rather self conscious about running outside. I feel like, as a larger individual, I look ridiculous. I assume every car that passes and pedestrian I encounter is judging and critiquing my running or finds it hilarious that I am trucking along, huffing and puffing. Is this total madness?

Any one else here struggle with this? Is there any advice for a larger runner to improve form and performance over time?

184,1622869321.0,I ran with out a shirt for the first time,"Now I know this might not be a big deal for some but to me it is. I have always struggled with my weight and have been self conscious about my body. I always hated going to pool parties as a kid or even going to the beach. Today I was on my run and it was super humid and I was sweating more than usual I have had problems with nipple irritation (man here by the way) so I generally always wear bandages over my nipples to help today they kept falling off and I was in tremendous pain. I stopped around 4 miles in my 11 mile run and came to a decision point. Call my wife and tell her to come get me or run without a shirt for the first time ever. I don’t know if it was the music or how I was feeling or if it because I am training for a marathon and I don’t know what is going to happen on race day but I should be prepared. So I took my shirt off tucked it in my shorts and went on for the next 7 miles with out it. It was such a freeing experience I really didn’t care what people thought of me or my body. I am proud of the weight I have lost and how I look. If they don’t like it that’s their problem not mine. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.



Edit: well this “blew up” over night. The community of runners and running is so great and I forget that sometimes. I have never run with someone and have always done it by myself so it is so great to know that there is a beautiful community out there. Thank you all for the kind words.

187,1609423771.0,A hawk grabbed my head while I was running and now I’m scared to go back out there,"I was running early in the morning like I’ve done for years. I had on a day glo yellow beanie and a headlamp (but the headlamp was turned off because I was on a well lit neighborhood street). 
As I was running on the sidewalk I felt a big whack/scrape on my head and it took me a few moments to figure out it was a hawk. He swooped, tried to grab my head, then flew back up before landing on some nearby telephone wires. 
Needless to say I screamed my head off and ran as fast as I could. I turned my headlamp up to the sky and turned it on but still felt pretty freaked out. 
I’m not hurt at all, the beanie is pretty thick. I’m also totally aware of how ridiculous this story is. 

But that being said I can’t help but be nervous about getting back out there! I’m afraid to wear my day glo bean which has been keeping me warm on these cold runs. 
I can’t understand why the hawk went for my head. Anyone have any ideas?

We sometimes get down about training, we drag our butts out of the house, and things are challenging. BUT most of us have also struggled with injuries and that is the absolute pits. 

Remember to be thankful for your health. And if you are working through an injury, keep up the rehab, the community is behind you and you will be lacing up before you know it.

189,1407278621.0,An interesting coincidence between Kilometres and Miles,"Okay, bear with me, this involves some math:

The Fibonacci Sequence, for those who don't know, is this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, .... Starting with 1, the two neighboring numbers added up equal the next number. One interesting aspect of these numbers is that their ratios all approach being what is called the golden ratio, 1.618....

So, for example, 3/2 is 1.5, 5/3 is 1.666, 8/5 is 1.6, 13/8 is 1.625, 21/13 is 1.615, 34/21 is 1.619, etc.

So what does this have to do with kilometres to miles? Well, the ratio of km to mi is 1.609 to 1. Since 1.609 is so close to the golden ratio, you can use the Fibonacci numbers to convert between kilometres and miles! For example, 5 km is quite close to 3 miles (3.1 mi). 8 km is almost exactly 5 miles, 13 km is 8 miles, 21 km is 13 miles, etc! I think this is awesome.

190,1587992806.0,I just want say I'm here for the slow runners!,"I've been seriously contempalting running a marathon the last six months or so. 

I've always thought of the running community as supportive, but I've been doing lots of research and forum reading regarding marathons and found so many runners up their butts about slow runners.

I've seen lots of horrible comments: 
• How anyone under six hours is walking (walking marathon distance in six hours or even eight hours is bloody impressive!)
• How slow runners waddle (wtf? I feel like its a choice of words to deliberately imply slow runners are fat)
• Slow runners don't deserve to be in marathons (if marathons are only about running fast, why isn't everyone competing for the win)
• Slow runners don't train as hard (everyone has different training methods, slow and fast. I know some fast runners who train twice a week, I know slow runners who train daily)
• Slow runners should be shot/decapitated to encourage them to speed up (I get this is a joke but really?!)
• Slow runners are fat f*cks (slow =/= fat, even if a slow runner is fat who cares, and if you get that offended by fat people you have bigger problems)

I just really don't get it, and I'm really disappointed in some of the running community.

What do they gain from belittling slow runners? The pace of slow runners does not invalidate the pace of fast runners. It doesn't make it shameful to be a runner if some other runners do it slowly. It doesnt make faster runners better.

~~

On a personal level: 

My target time would be about six hours. That's a slow time, around when most marathons cut off. But I think its still pretty cool.

But I also understand there will be people who are aiming for lower times, or achieve them accidentally, and that's cool too. 26 miles is a feat whatever way you put it and anyone competing will need to train hard -  walking or running - which should be respected.

People might run slow for various reasons - physical impairment, disability, hot weather slowing them down, race not going as planned (injury, bad day, dehydration, headache etc), people who want to power walk it.

As a community I don't think we should ever belittle anyone trying to take on exercise. As a society we really need to do more of it and we should always encourage any sort of exercise - even if it's someone walking a marathon.

I agree that there should be cut offs because you can't close roads forever and marshalls have places they want to be too, and I think there should be a certain level of minimum fitness in place for most marathons (because its a big challenge and you'll only injure yourself if you don't have some level of fitness). But otherwise I don't see a problem with cutoffs of seven or eight hours.

Anyway, I just want to rep for the slow runners. Keep doing what you're doing, keep pursuing fitness, keep running your snail pace cos you're doing great!

192,1594050390.0,Ran my first 5K!!!,"I just did it! My first one, without walking or stopping! Oh how I wished I could do it three months ago but doubted that I could! Now, it’s done!

I’m 44M. About a year ago I was overweight, had finally enough. Went on a diet, primarily CICO. In 8 months I dropped 30 pounds and hit 20% body fat. About 4 months in, started lifting weights to maintain some muscle. 

When the pandemic hit, I stopped going to the gym and instead started running. Boy was I out of shape! Couldn’t run three minutes without wheezing and doubling over, after years of neglect. Then I started reading this sub. Thank you all the kind strangers generously sharing their advice and the newbies posting their milestones. Between the directions and the inspiration, I’ve kept at it. And just ran my first 5K in 36:10! 

For those who may find something to follow here, here are my lessons learned:

1) ok, it’s a cliche but it’s true: run slow. Slower than you think. And slower than that! When I first started, I was trying 7 mph. That was too fast for me. I finally found my stride down at 4.8! 

2) then keep at slow for weeks!  This was hard, I wanted to go fast. And I sure thought two weeks and 8 sessions was enough 😂. About two and a half weeks in, I went for 50 minutes. It felt ok at the time, but the next week was brutal. I was sore, my knees ached. I clearly wasn’t ready and lost about a week as I recovered.

3) run frequently but allow yourself to recover. I listened to my body, if I didn’t feel right, I skipped a day. Mostly, I ran every other day. Most of my runs were 20-30 minutes, and my longer ones 40-45 minutes. I ran the long ones once a week and rested two days afterwards

4) keep at it. It took me about 8 weeks to truly feel comfortable. But I got there. Your body needs time to adjust especially if you have been out of shape. Years of neglect doesn’t get fixed in a couple weeks. Heck, maybe not even in a couple months. But you do start seeing progress quickly enough. I could climb a flight of stairs without running out of breath, started not to sweat until 10 minutes into my runs, and my heart rate started declining! Slowly but surely.

Well, I think that’s it! If this out of shape middle aged man can do it, so can you! If you need one last push to get you started, I hope this is it. Go get your shoes on and start running.

This was my first ever half marathon. As far as races go, I've done a couple 5ks and a marathon relay where I ran 6.7 miles on my leg. As the title mentions, I used to be almost 400lbs, progress pic here - http://imgur.com/gallery/uYiS1xm

As I dropped weight, I gave running a try, started couch to 5k and fell in love with running since it was something I never ever thought I'd be able to do.

I worked my way up to the 5k, and then gradually got to 10k and stayed there for awhile. I didn't think I'd go further than that but I started feeling better on longer runs, finding more runners online, discovering the ten junk miles podcast, and I've decided my ultimate goal is to become an ultra marathon runner. This half is my first stepping stone.

**Prep**

I looked at like 5 different training plans, tried doing the zen labs one since I used that for couch to 5k, but I didn't like the start/stop method they used. I just wanted to run miles. So I found one I liked and I kinda modified it. I work 50 hours a week and have 3 kids so I had to find a plan that wasn't too time intensive. I would run 3 times a week, 2 runs between 4-6 miles, and my long run would increase by a mile each week until I got the 13. I would bike to work sometimes for cross training, and my job is super active so I often would be at 20-30,000 daily steps.

Training plan worked great! I had to stop myself on the last two weeks, once I got to 11 miles I reallllly just wanted to add those two miles but I figured I'd save myself for a special occasion 😉.

**Race Day**

I set 6 alarms from 430-515am. The shuttles across the street from the hotel left at 5-6am to take us to the Fargo dome. I wanted to get up early enough to complete my morning dooties and be early to take it all in. I didn't want to believe the weather reports but sure enough. Pouring rain and 40 degrees. I typically love running in the rain, it's a spiritual experience for me. It makes me feel unstoppable, EFF YOU MOTHER NATURE YOU CAN'T STOP ME!! Buuut typically it's warmer.. And it starts when I'm about two miles into my run. I went back and forth between my thermal 2.0 baselayer and just a long sleeve dryfit, I settled on the thermal with my run the year 2019 challenge dryfit tee-shirt. Shorts with thermal leggings, my underarmor face mask which I took off about mile two, and my big winter gloves. Since loosing weight, I get cold all the time now.. But especially my hands. I have super wimpy hands now. I have to wear gloves in anything under 50 degrees or they just get so cold.

I board the shuttle and start walking around the Fargo Dome. So many people! It's awesome! I meet a guy I met on instragram and that was pretty cool, do some stretching, more morning dooties and before I know it it's time to line up!

I start making my way down the race shoot. The Fargo marathon starts and ends inside the Fargo Dome, which is a big event center. There are thousands of people lined up so I make my way to about the middle of the pack, a little past the 2:30 pacer. The race starts and the line slowly starts to move! We run out of the dome being cheered on by about a thousand people which is super freaking cool, and directly outside into pouring rain, oh and suprise the wind picked up too! NOT TODAY SATAN! I hate treadmill running, so I was one of the crazy people out in sub zero weather getting my miles in. This was nothing compared to those conditions ☺

We looped around the Fargo dome and starting getting into residential areas. Miles 1-4 we winded around some streets which helped with the wind since we weren't going the same direction for long. They had live bands playing under tents and in garages along the whole way. Super cool! I'm sure if the weather was nicer there would have been more, but there was a few hundred people along the way cheering everyone on and giving high fives which I absolutely loved!

5-8 miles we went down some underpasses and looped around some more residential areas. I felt like I was going slower than I normally do but my strava said I was at a faster pace that I was during training. I felt just fine so I kept it up! I took my first gu around mile 7. I didn't feel like I needed it, but I wanted to make sure I didn't change too much from my training and that's when I usually took it. Grabbed my first drink around mile 8 as well. It's still raining and windy, but I didn't even notice at this point.

Past mile 8 we run down Broadway which is a historical street in downtown Fargo, more people, more bands and the atmosphere is just awesome! Mile 9 and 10 I start feeling a but sluggish. I pop my other gu and find another drink at the next station. I never once thought about dropping, I even told myself heck even if I have to walk the rest of the way I'm finishing. I felt super slow but then strava said I was at a 12:00 pace.. Which was normal during my training so I was like well heck let's go!

The last few miles seemed to take forever, but I kept trucking along. I texted my wife who had been waiting in the dome with our children that I was almost there. Finally we turned a street and I could see the Fargo dome! So close! I tried picking up the pace a bit but legs weren't having it. Until I turned the last corner to go through the tunnel and saw the finish line. I felt full of energy and like I just started the run fresh. I basically dead sprinted, passed 4 people and barreled through the finish line! I DID IT!! I almost started crying but I wanted to find my family so focusing on that helped. I got my medal, pushed through all the food lines and gave my kids and wife a big hug!! (to which my oldest replied, Daddy you are soaked!!) I forgot all about being wet and the conditions, but heyI FREAKING DID IT!

We all celebrated and we went to the local donut shop for a victory donut afterwards!

My next goal is to hopefully run the full marathon in September in Bismarck. I'm hoping I can continue my training plan I used for the half, keeping my two shorter runs and increasing the long run by a mile each week. Should bring me to the end of August/early September and ready to rock out the 26.2 miles!!

So excited to keep going, I might find a race or two in between for training. Dropping more weight between there is going to help tons, as well as more milage! I feel I can definitely break the 2:30 mark next time I run a half ☺

I did get kinda discouraged looking at the results, I finished about 75%, so hey not last! I got over it pretty quickly, I reminded myself how far I've come and hey I've only been running 3 years! Just gotta keep at it and rack up the medal count! It'll all come in due time!",running
194,1583864864.0,I started running a year ago because people told me my dog was fat...,"This time last year I got very tired of hearing people tell me I had a fat dog (he was 77 pounds and ideally would look best at 65-67 pounds, according to the vet). I am a very anxious person and guilt was born before I was, so basically my brain thought that if people thought my dog was fat that meant that I don't exercise him enough and I'm a terrible dog mom. The more I reacted when people told me the more they said it (jokingly, but still - behind every joke is a little truth). 

Wanting to do better by him I decided to start running. We lived in a one bedroom apartment so to exercise him more meant I needed to exercise myself more, too. I originally had a goal in mind of running a marathon by the time I was 26 (I started running on my 25th birthday) and that my dog was going to be my training buddy. Well my birthday is tomorrow and I will be 26 and while im not quite ready for a marathon, I am signed up to do a half marathon in May and my dog and i go for a 10 mile run every Saturday.  

For the first few months I ran 7 days a week. I never worried about how long I was running, just that I did it, so some days I ran one or two miles, others I ran five. (I didnt take him on all my runs because 7 days a week is excessive and I wanted him to have rest days too, even if I wasnt giving them to myself). 

Interestingly, my endurance was getting way better and my dog's was not. He was starting to get super tired after about 2 miles so I brought him to the vet and explained the situation. His weight was increasing, he was getting tired easily and I wanted his thyroid checked. She didnt see any immediate warning signs that something is wrong but she did a blood test anyway and found out that he had anaplasmosis, a rare blood infection from a tick (that isnt protected against flea and tick meds that he gets regularly) and it was slowing his metabolism down and draining his energy. I likely would not have realized the difference if I wasn't running with him several times a week. I feel like I knew his behaviors better and just knew him better from running together, as silly as that sounds. 

Flash forward several months, hes doing tippy taps at the door waiting to go on a trail run, hes down to 67 pounds, I went from 177 to 157, size 12 to a size 8 and we are both so much happier! We run 3 or 4 times a week and he gets to run with me off leash in the woods near our house (we moved into a house with a yard in August). When the weather is bad and I run on the treadmill in the basement he aggressively chews his toys next to me, not quite sure what his role is but happy to be part of it. Honestly, running has made me so much better. Happier, more confident, driven, and a better dog mom. I don't feel (as) guilty anymore because he has a pretty damn good life and I made that happen for him. 

I'm hoping this doesnt read like a rant, this is just the first time I've set my mind to something challenging and I feel like I've accomplished it and I've done better for my dog in the process.

Tldr; people kept telling me my dog was fat so I started running with him to help him lose weight. A year later, we run together 3 or 4 times a week and have lost 30 pounds combined. We are both infinitely happier.",running
195,1599270977.0,"Holy crap, please learn about “exercise-induced anaphylaxis”","So there I was, going for my typical, non-strenuous, flat 5-mile run in beautiful 70-degree weather. I was hydrated and had eaten my usual breakfast a couple hours prior. About a half-mile in, I notice my palms are bright red and super itchy. I had just treated our hot tub prior to leaving, so I figured maybe I had gotten some of the chemicals on my hands or something. Another half mile in, I start getting something resembling gas pains in my stomach. Weird, I think to myself, but figure it’s just a quick run and it’ll pass. I continued for more than a mile and a half as the pain kept growing and growing. Finally I had to stop and walk the last mile—the longest mile of my life as I was now shaking, lethargic, and experiencing tingling in my hands and face—not to mention the now extreme abdominal pain. I ended up basically collapsing on my porch swing—my partner ran out to help and said my lips were blue. I was disoriented and had trouble opening and closing my hands. I wouldn’t let him take me to the ER (wasn’t really thinking clearly, should have gone) but symptoms resolved after about 20 minutes of him giving me water and putting ice on my neck. I was freaked out enough to go to Urgent Care and their diagnosis was “Exercise-induced anaphylaxis” which is a sudden allergic reaction to freaking exercise! Most commonly happens to women runners, and may strike once or twice and never again—but it can actually be fatal. The worst thing you can do is to try to push through the pain as I did—had I stopped immediately it probably wouldn’t have gotten so scary. If you feel sudden weird symptoms on a run (especially that resemble an allergic reaction like my hot itchy palms), stop! Your! Run! Stay safe peeps.",running

197,1598368321.0,upsetting encounter with a Karen on my run,"I (17 F) was on my run this morning when I had a very irritating experience.

Because of covid, whenever I pass someone, I step off of the sidewalk and a bit into the road, just to make sure people have plenty of space because I don't wear a mask when I run. The last thing I want to do is make people uncomfortable. People usually wave and say thank you or good morning. But one particular woman was NOT having it. She was on the sidewalk, coming up the street while I was going down. I did what I usually do, kept my distance and headed out into the road (safely). As I approached her, she forcefully pointed away from her. I assumed she needed even more space so I stopped and waited for some cars to pass before I headed out farther into the road. Then she lost it, and screamed ""CROSS THE F\*\*\*ING ROAD!!"" I was absolutely stunned, and crossed. Technically, she was on the wrong side of the road, I was on the correct side and she made me cross onto the wrong side. If she didn't want to cross, she could have moved onto the grass on the other side of the sidewalk if she felt that she needed more space. She also **wasn't wearing a mask**. I didn't care that she wasn't wearing a mask, because we had plenty of space between us. But if you're that uncomfortable being around people who are 6 feet away from you, you should at least wear a mask. I also think it's wrong that she swore at me. I'm 17, but she has no idea how old I am. I didn't think I deserved that. I was very upset and on the verge of tears for the rest of my run. :(

Has anything similar happened to anyone else? How should I have dealt with it?

199,1492956466.0,Boston Marathon runner takes a second medal for his wife and posts it on social media,"Original post [here](http://i.imgur.com/JzpA3EK.jpg)

So a guy runs in the Boston Marathon, things don't go quite as well as he had wanted to. When he finishes, he snags a second medal because he felt his wife ""deserved"" one for supporting him in his training. Puts it up on social media, and as expected, outrage ensues.

Here's one reply:

Personally, I think it's incredibly poor form. Medals are for finishers, not for supporters. He's free to give her his own medal if he feels she deserves it. And where does the line get drawn? Why does she get a medal and not anyone else who supports their spouse?

>The young athlete died together with his coach, Gervais Hakizimana, in a traffic accident...in a car driven by the athlete himself.

>the father of marathon world record holder Kelvin Kiptum called on the Kenyan government to investigate the circumstances of the death of his son

>The governor of the Kenyan county of Uasin Gishu (where the incident occurred), Jonathan Bii, joined the plea of the athlete's father. ""we call on the Police to speed up investigations so that we can find out what caused the accident,"" Bii told reporters.

>He noted that his son assured him the last time they spoke that he was feeling well and was ready to break the marathon record again, going under two hours. ""He said his body was now fit and he could run for 1.59:00,"" his father revealed.

Did these mysterious visitors tamper with Kiptum's car? Is it just a red herring and a father desperately seeking answers? Motor vehicle deaths in Africa have become an increasingly common occurrence due to more people gaining access to vehicles and poor road infrastructure. There's no indication at this point what caused the crash.

### Training
I ran my first half marathon in Philidelphia a few months ago and had an unbelievable time.  My goal for that race was to be sub 2:00, and I was able to meet that through a lot of training with a 1:58:41. I immediately knew I wanted to book another race, so my friends and I booked the Asheville half in March.  Shortly after that, I had a separate trip booked in Tampa and realized it was the same weekend as the Gasparilla half.  I decided to register for fun as a prep for Asheville.  To make a long story short, I had a lot of life changes happen between registering and this past weekend, so unlike training for the race in Philadelphia, my training (if you could even call it that) was scattered and unregimented.  I went on roughly 10 runs between December and yesterday with the longest being 7 miles.


I was fairly anxious the week leading up to the race, but I kept reminding myself that I was just doing this for fun and not to worry about the time.  I had proven to myself I could run a half in under 2 hours, so I set that as my stretch goal with my realistic goal being sub 2:10.  The few long runs I went on between December and yesterday all went pretty well with average mile times in the 8:30 range, so I felt that was reasonable.  As an aside, I clearly need to focus on slower running in training.


The main thing I focused on the few days before the race was eating enough.  I did not do that for Philadelphia, and around the mile 10 mark, I could feel myself running out of energy.  I generally am not a big eater, but I made sure I took in a lot of calories Thursday and Friday without making myself uncomfortable, and on Saturday I ate a standard amount of food for me.

### Pre-race
First, I did not realize this race was a 6am start until a few days before.  I forced myself to wake up at 4:30am on Saturday so I would be able to sleep the night before the race, and this strategy worked.  I was asleep by 10:30pm Saturday night and woke up without my alarm around 3:45 feeling surprisingly rested.  I had a little coffee and was ready to go.


I had scheduled an uber the night before for 4:45am and got to the race around 5:10am.  While in the car, I listened to music to get myself in the right headspace, and while I was telling myself the time didn't matter, my competitive side kept telling me that I had it in me to run a good race.  My uber dropped me off, I ate a rice crispy treat (my favorite pre-run/workout snack) and I walked around in the cool dark morning familiarizing myself with the start line, and just took it all in.  I brought a small bag and didn't realize that the bag check was in the convention center and not near the start line.  Not a big deal, but note to self and others to review where the bag check is before you show up.  Thankfully I had plenty of time and this gave me a good opportunity for a light jog to warm up and let out the nerves.


As start time got closer, I was continually surprised at how good I felt.  I made my way to the corral and decided to start behind the 2:00 pacer like I did in Philadelphia.  The start was a little disorganized, so as people pushed in, the pacers moved around, and I ended up toward the back of the group behind the 1:55 pacer.  I decided this would serve the same purpose, as long as I couldn't see the 2:00 pacer, I knew I was doing alright.

The weather was clear and slightly crisp, energy was high, and my run started at 6:03am.

### Race
I told myself to start slow, but given the adrenaline and the group I was with, that did not happen.  The first half mile I was pushing much faster than I intended.  It's hard to let people pass, but I made my way from the middle of the road to the left side and reminded myself that this is a (half) marathon, not a sprint.  I was feeling good though, and the first mile went by very quickly.  9:01. OK, I thought, a little faster than I wanted to start - I wanted to be more in the (9:15-9:30 range to warmup) - but that's ok.  Let people pass, run your race.  The 1:55 pacer was still in sight, so I eased up and just told myself, settle in.  This was something I said to myself countless times during the race.


As I finished the second mile I could feel that I was pushing a little harder than I wanted, but I still felt ok.  My wrist vibrated and I looked down.  8:41.  My stomach slightly dropped.  This was way faster than I intended, and surely I would burn out if I didn't slow down.  Also, what the hell is this pacer doing going so fast?  When they spun the sign around at the start it showed that the pace would be 8:57.  That's the only reason I was ok with keeping up.  This is when I realized that, using simple math, I must have misread the sign.  I wasn't running with an 8:57 pacer, I was running with an 8:47 pacer.  I decided to slow it down, keep the group generally in sight, and settle in.


Miles 1.5-3 are usually my hardest.  I can feel my legs getting tight and it's harder to breathe.  I've watched YouTube videos that this is common, and that was the case here.  I was able to keep my anxiety and breathing in check and reminded myself that by mile 3 I would be feeling good, and that is exactly what happened.  Around mile 3 I was feeling fresh, I was somehow on a great pace, and the sun was just starting to rise.  It was absolutely beautiful, and I looked around at the palm trees and reminded myself of how lucky I was to be down in Florida on a run and seeing all of this.  I couldn't stop smiling and turned my music up, thrilled that I was having a blast.  Part of me was worried that I would be miserable after the first leg, but I was already proving to myself that I had way more in me than I thought.  The next few miles felt the same as we finished our loop of the island and made our way to the long stretch down and back on Bayshore Boulevard along the bay.


My brother-in-law ran this race last year, and he told me that miles 5-13 were tough mentally.  He was right.  This part of the race is gorgeous as you're running along the water, but it is long and straight.  And then you turn around, and it is long and straight.  I'm really glad that I was mentally prepared for this, as I was still on a crazy fast pace (for me), and once again, told myself to settle in, enjoy the sunrise, and don't look too far ahead because it's just going to look the same.


The biggest pivot I made in this race was my view of aid stations.  In Philadelphia, my main goal was to run without stopping.  I'm not an experienced runner, so in my mind, if you stopped running during a race, you didn't *really* run it.  Naive, I'm aware, but that was my perspective.  I mentioned earlier that in Philadelphia, around mile 10 my body substantially ran out of energy.  I wonder why that is?  During that race, I grabbed water while I was moving like I had seen people in the Olympics, took in maybe 1/10 of what was in the cup, inhaled half of that, and then was left coughing and more out of breath than I was before the aid station.  Not this time.  I stopped at every aid station (roughly every mile), alternating between water and endurance Gatorade.  For the majority of the race, I walked a few feet while I drank my cup, and then kept going.  Massive difference.  I was hydrated, and it gave me a brief respite to look forward to each mile.  This was great, but it did cause me to make a quick bathroom break around mile 7 (which you can see in my mile times).  I had to fight with myself to stop, but I am so glad that I did.  Reminder for my next race, don't be afraid to stop.


Everything was going great until mile 10.  Shoutout to the guy who gave me a Dunkin Munchkin around mile 8.  Note to self: next time, don't try and take that down in one bite, they are super dry and surprisingly big.  Very grateful there was a station with water about a minute later.


Mile 10.  The same place my body wanted to shut down in Philadelphia.  This time it wasn't a lack of energy, it was a lack of training.  Maybe it was mental, but I was hurting.  For anyone else who deals with anxiety, you know how scary it can be when you can't catch your breath.  That is how I felt, and I was starting to feel like I wouldn't be able to catch it if I didn't stop.  I went through a battle here, and this exact experience is why I have fallen in love with running.  I ran the race in Philadelphia with friends, and for miles 3 - 13.1 I was side by side with one of my training partners.  I couldn't slow down in that race, we were in it together.  In this race though, I was alone.  I kept telling myself that I proved I could push through my body's alarm bells in Philadelphia, but this time it felt different.  


I made my way to the right side of the street to the yellow line and told myself that I had run a great race, and I could start walking.  I probably would still be able to finish under 2 hours as the 1:55 pacer was still in sight.  As I made it to the yellow line, I realized that I had now run about 30 seconds since I gave myself permission to quit.  And each step that I took was one more than I thought was possible.  I put my head down, stopped looking ahead, and focused on falling into each step.  Each step that I took was one step closer to being done.  3 miles to go, that's less than a 5k.  2.5 miles to go, that's less than my short loop of Central Park.  2 miles to go.  What's two miles?  I know I have that in me.  Settle in. 


I could feel myself starting to get very hot.  The temperature was cool, but the Florida sun had fully risen and was beating down on me.  I passed the 12-mile marker and told myself I was done drinking, I just needed this to be over.  The 1:55 pacer was still in sight, and as I approached the last aid station I struggled with my strategy.  Did I stop and walk a few feet as I had at the other aid stations or do I push through?  My strategy of stopping at aid stations had worked so far, so I stopped, grabbed a cup of water, and did my longest walk yet.  It was incredibly painful watching the 1:55 pacer pull away as I dumped the water over my head, but I knew that the 1:55 was somehow still possible since I had started behind them.  I put my head down, got on the yellow line, and started running.


Maybe it is in my head, but I am fully convinced that the final aid station is not at a half-mile marker.  I was timing my distance at this point by songs, and I timed my final push toward the pacer with what I thought was the very final stretch.  I passed the pacer as my second to last song finished, looked up, and the finish line was distantly in sight.  A little further than I had hoped, but not too bad.  Keep pushing.  Settle in.  As we began approaching what I thought was the finish, panic set in.  That's the start line.  Not the finish.  How much further would it be?  I was pushing a pace that was not sustainable.  I rounded the corner and could see, far in the distance, the actual finish line.  But I was slowing down.  I had expended what I thought was the last of my energy for this push, but I still had a more than insignificant distance to go.


This time, I didn't put my head down.  I stared at the finish line and the flags and knew that rest was almost here.  As I entered the final stretch (10 meters, 50 meters, 100 meters, I honestly don't know as this is a bit of a blur) I started sprinting toward the finish.  I crossed the line ahead of the 1:55 pacer, shattering what I thought was remotely possible for this race.


### Post-race
My mom and brother-in-law were waiting for me just after I crossed the line, and it was incredibly cool to share that experience and emotions with them.  I checked my watch.  13.26 miles, 1:54:38.  My mom has a very funny video of me continually saying that I wasn't sure what just happened with genuine shock on my face.  It all felt very surreal, and it honestly still does.  As we walked out, there was a booth for engraving your medal with your official time.  Given how well I had done, it felt very worth it.  It also provided a very cool way of learning my official time.  They handed my medal back with my name, and underneath it, 1:53:56.  A time that started with 1:53.


For more experienced or faster runners, this all may sound dramatic for what many likely consider a reasonably good time for a 30-year-old guy, but about 1.5 years ago, I was living a very unhealthy lifestyle and couldn't run a mile without stopping.  I had always told myself that maybe I could train for a 5k, but these long official races were just out of reach.  Those races are for other people.  And that's ok.  Completing both of these races has reminded me of just how much I am capable of, and that even when our minds are telling us to quit, we have so much more to give.


I'm now dealing with some pretty rough blisters and very sore muscles (flying the same day as a race is rough), but overall feeling on top of the world.  If you read all of this, I hope you found it interesting.  As I am finishing typing, I realize this exercise (no pun intended) was pretty therapeutic and something that I will likely look back on as I continue with this awesome sport.  Time for 19 days of rest before the next one!

### Training
What's good folks? Posting this under an alt account because my main has a lot of cringe capitalism content nobody needs to see. So, prior to this race the furthest I've run is a 10k. I did one of the ol Garmin watch plans, all of which went great! Missed a few runs so my furthest pre-race run was only 9 miles. I was a bit nervous about this but ""they"" told me if you can run 9 you can run 13 so I was trying to maintain some confidence going into this shitshow. 

### Pre-race
Traveling with my wife and 18-month old, we arrived in Vegas the day before the half and checked into Vdara. No massive complaints about the hotel, which was smoke-free and no gaming which is a crime as I was trying to rip heaters and play Pai Gow but thankfully the tables are easily accessible next door at Bellagio, Cosmo and Aria. Placed a few sportsbets and ate some dumplings at Din Tai Fung before crushing a couple $11 beers and getting to bed around 9.

Unfortunately for me, my daughter who sleeps like an angel at home decided she was not having it, leading to one of the worst nights sleep Ive had in ages. Woke up feeling like trash but told myself ""you've run tired before it's no big deal"" (foreshadowing). Honestly was not feeling good most of the day and was only able to eat a bowl of oatmeal and some juice. 

The thing about this damn race is it starts at 4:30pm, which is absurdly late for me. I went over and lined up around 3:30 and just stood around for 90 minutes feeling nervous and sort of not great. Eventually our group made it to the start and we were off!

### Race
Miles 1-3: Started at a slow 12m pace, hoping to kick it up to 11 in the middle portion. Around mile 2.5 I looked at my watch and saw my heart rate was about 20bpm more than normal. Not a good sign. 

Miles 4-6: Back along the main part of the strip. Great crowd energy and it was pretty fun as the sun started to set. Made sure not to look into the eye of the sphere as it's known that is how they get you.

Miles 7-9: After you pass the Strat you enter an absolute wasteland. Around mile 8 there was a table with a woman yelling ""free wine!"" and I'm absolutely certain she wasn't associated with the race. Shockingly didn't really see anyone taking her up on the free wine. The turn around was around this point where you turn onto the most unmaintained road in Nevada. Dodging potholes and glass was a fun added challenge.

Mile 10: As I passed the 10 mile marker I hit an absolute wall. Started cramping and feeling extremely ill. Thought I might puke but just slowed it down and started some walking. Really unusual feeling as I generally feel fantastic throughout my runs. I expect a combination of training, poor sleep and lack of food really fucked me here. Shout-out to the DJ who screamed in my ear to keep running outside the strip club with no name other than a sign that said ""strippers"".

Mile 11-13.1: This whole race I was looking forward to absolutely destroying a pint after but around this point I knew nothing else was going in my body this fine Sunday. Still feeling extremely ill I jog-walked towards the finish. I was in good company though as lots of folks seemed to be struggling at this point. Crossed the finish line and spent 10 minutes trying to escape to get back to my room. Grabbed the medal and a free banana and bounced.

### Post-race
Got back to my room and opened the banana, when the smell hit me I immediately vomited. 

Shaking like crazy I took a quick shower, climbed into bed and passed out.

### The next day

Woke up at 6am feeling fantastic and pretty happy I was able to finish. Overall while my time was extremely disappointing I'm happy to have finished and would run it again if I have the chance!

### Training
After finishing Couch to 5K, I kept up with running but missed the structure of a training programme. Having recently bought a shiny new watch, I started up the Garmin beginner half marathon plan with no real goal other than to build a stronger running base. A few weeks in I decided that if I was going to the effort of a 16-week training block I might as well have a race to complete at the end, so after searching around for a fairly small, fairly local race, I entered the Stockport Trail Half.

I had opted for the heart rate version of the Garmin plan, and my biggest hurdle early on was finding a pace I could hold while staying in Z2. I quickly realised that my previous training had been far too fast, so I had to spend a few weeks doing run-walk intervals for my easy runs to build up the low aerobic capacity.

My training week averaged 35km across 3 runs: easy or tempo; intervals; long run. I supplemented the runs with swimming and indoor cycling, each once or twice a week. The longest run session was 2 hours which took me up to 22km - a real confidence boost going into the race knowing I could do the distance. 

### Pre-race
In the two days prior to the race I focused on staying hydrated and stocking up on carbs. On race morning it was a 5.30am alarm, a very syrupy porridge breakfast, and then into the car for the 90 min drive to Stockport. I arrived early, which meant no queues for the porta-loos, but a good hour and a half standing around on a none-too-warm February morning. I did a short warm-up jog and some stretching before getting into my starting wave.

### Race
The race route sets out on a path along the decommissioned railway line towards Macclesfield, turning around at 10km and joining the canal towpath for the return leg. This meant it was very flat (only 40m total ascent), and although billed as a trail race, the dirt, gravel and cobble surfaces were very manageable in road shoes. 

Based on my training runs (where I ran a 48-min 10K, and 22km in 2:08), I'd set myself a pace plan for a 1:50 finish, with negative splits starting at 5:30/km and finishing at 4:54/km. The first 5km felt very easy, and I had to remind myself to stick to the plan while I watched most of my wave go past me within 10 mins of the start. My target splits only dropped by around 3s/km each time, so each increment felt manageable as I warmed up into the race. I brought four 20g carb gels with me, and started taking them at 20 min intervals from 5km onwards.

The 10km turnaround took me by surprise - if the marshal hadn't been standing in the path, I might have missed the turn entirely! I had planned to reassess at this point, and decide whether to continue aiming for 1:50 or adjust down to 1:55. The legs were still fine and my HR had stayed steady in the mid 160s (my Z3), so I was confident I could keep on with the 1:50 plan. I pushed on along the canal, overtaking where it was safe to do so. The wind was definitely a factor on the return leg, and more than once I took advantage of drafting behind another runner to save some energy.

The only real mistake of the race came where I misread my watch and thought I had completed 16km (note to self: ""kilometre 16"" means you've done 15, not 16!). I was feeling pretty good and decided to abandon the rest of the pace plan and treat the remaining ""5"" km like a 5K race. With that in mind, I also decided not to take on my final gel because it would slow me down. It took a couple of kms at around 4:50/km pace to realise my mistake, and by then I was committed so I just kept pushing, eventually getting my final kilometre down to 4:35 (only 6s off my actual 5K PB pace!)

I crossed the line for a chip timed finish of 1:48:xx, looking exhausted and ungainly (as confirmed by the finish photos), but more than a minute under my goal time for my first half marathon!

### Post-race
I definitely didn't stretch or cool down well enough after the race, but I did get possibly the best flapjack I've ever tasted along with my medal at the finish, so still a win in my book. I'm sore today, so plenty of foam rolling and a recovery swim or two before I get back to running again.

I can't get over how well the negative split plan worked. I felt strong throughout, and the psychological boost of passing other runners right up until the finish line can't be underestimated. Now having a baseline HM PB pace, I think I could start my splits slightly faster and do the whole race ""on-plan"", but as a first race based on a guesstimate finish time I'm pretty pleased.

It was a fantastic first HM experience (and first race in general), and I already have my eye on another HM later this year. For now, though, it's time to shave the legs and prepare the lycra for my first sprint triathlon in 12 weeks...
