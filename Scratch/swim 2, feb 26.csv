2,1708953545.0,"Swam my first km, how to keep it up and improve?","Hi everyone,

I'm in my early thirties and while I always did sports during my life, I stopped in recent years and gained some weight (a bunch, 110kg for 180cm).

I want to share my last 2 weeks experience and ask you for some advice.

Two weeks ago I went to my local gym on a Sunday to just relax with a bit of swimming and then a bit of spa.

While I grew up near the sea, swimming since I was a kid and doing spearfishing, I never swam in a pool and I quickly realized that my first day was going to be dreadful. I had to stop every 25m and I managed to swim basically 300 meters total in free style. But I loved it 

I started watching videos and reading the subreddit trying to improve and I started going to the pool 3/4 times a week in the last 2 weeks focusing on breathing, movements, balance, etc.

I started seeing results and I managed to swim, with breaks, a total of  600m at the start of last week and mid week I swam my first km with a 10 seconds break every 25m and 20 seconds break every 50.

Knowing I could at least swim that much with breaks, I decided to try and increase the amount of laps I could do without stopping, and this last saturday I went back and I managed to swim 400m without breaks, rest 2 minutes and do another 400m. It was hard for me but I managed.

Yesterday I went to the pool almost by chance and while I was very tired, I decided to try and do the 2x400 meters swim again.

I barely finished the first 400 meters and after resting I started the second one thinking I wouldn't be able to finish it, but after doing 200 meters it felt like something clicked.

I wasn't in debt of oxygen, my arms didn't hurt and I just kept going. Completed the 400m and kept going, did another 400m and thought ""It's just 200 meters more for a km"" and I just went for it and did it!

I was very tired (ate a whole family sized pizza), but I'm so happy that I had to share with someone, especially because without reading a bunch of posts here I don't think I would have improved this much from barely making 25m.

Now, I would like to build up stamina before joining a course and I would like to know where do I go from here.

Am I ok repeating this 400meters + 1km until I feel more comfortable with the full km? Should I try and increase the length and keep my pace or is it better shorter but faster stints?

My goal is first to get enough stamina so that I won't waste my money with a course where I wouldn't be able to swim enough, and then lose weight.

I still don't understand how yesterday I went from almost dying to just not feeling tired and I hope it wasn't just a fluke.

Sorry if these are dumb questions but I'm out of my element with swimming in the pool.

Thank you so much!",Swimming

My main probably is the 100m free, the last time I did it I messed up and only did a 50m, but I know I could have went farther.

Question: I wonder if not being proficient in breaststroke would puts me in a disadvantage here? Should I invest some time into improving it?

Which one should I focus on more while training?

Two of my best pools close by have closed (being replaced, new ones not ready for 2+yrs).  I'm a member at a brand new YMCA very close to my house, and the pool is very nice with a great laps only 5:30 am Mon-Fri schedule, but their adult lesson availability is pretty limited, and the pool is completely unusable on weekends aka non stop kids lessons.

I've also looked into Masters, but again locations are too far away for me for weekday morning practices, at least until the two new pools open in about 2 years.

At least where I live and for a full time working professional, it seems so hard to find anything that could serve as ongoing source of education, mentorship and support.  

I'm now looking at travelling to a swim camp somewhere in either western Canada or USA and hope to find something that will serve as a swimming vacation that will help me improve in technique, speed etc.

My search for progress in my swimming often makes me feel lonely, if that makes any sense.  Can't seem to meet or connect with other swimmers at my pool for a friendly chat and support etc.

26,1708882537.0,Learning to swim with face in the water as an adult,"As a kid I had about four years of school swimming lessons, but could never progress to any higher levels because while I was comfortable in water and perfectly capable on my back, I could not swim 25m front stroke as I could not swim with my face in the water. Nothing the instructors tried helped (although they mostly tried yelling ‘face in the water!’ at me for four years straight). 
Since then, not much changed - when swimming, I’m fine on my back but splutter and sink on my front. I had a small breakthrough last summer when I had the opportunity to go snorkelling over a coral reef. I forced myself to try because I didn’t want to miss out, and with the snorkel and mask I was a competent swimmer, and was even fine over incredibly deep water, which previously felt impossible. This proved to me that the only thing holding me back was the ability to put my face in the water and manage my breathing. I do have some sensory issues so that might play a part. Swimming with a snorkel was amazing, but I want to be able to swim in an emergency situation.
I am reluctant to pay for swimming lessons as they are expensive, and in my experience just made me feel terrible about myself. I would be very grateful for any advice anyone had for overcoming this particular barrier. Thank you!",Swimming

49,1708806854.0,How to know whether to quit college sport or walk away?,"i’m a D1 competitive swimmer, (18 female) freshmen. I have been debating whether to say goodbye to my sport or not, and feel as I could really use some advice and opinions. I also have 2 more years of college yet, as I’ll graduate early. So should I give it at least one more year or be done? Instead of having a big rant over why or why I shouldn’t quit, i’m listing it out instead. Any comments would be greatly appreciated. 

Why I’m considering quitting-
1. Injuries- I’ve had problems in my shoulders/biceps and problems with my knees over my career. Some days it feels worse than others, but it’s stayed the same as far as consistently levels.
2. Not improving- Before I joined my college team, I was improving quite regularly with many PR’s but now I haven’t dropped any, but I have been adding excess amounts of time. It has really damaged my mental health. 
3. Burn out- Now this one is like 50/50 for me. Sometimes I think i’m ready to make my decision final but then I find it so hard to walk away. I’m currently at a conference swim meet, and I have had a terrible meet. Up until today, I was set on being done. But now that it’s actually our last day, I don’t know if I can actually say that. I guess you can say it’s such a love hate relationship.
4. Academics- I tend to make decent grades (could be better), but I find it difficult with always being so exhausted and busy to do great. My “all” is just like me being held back by these factors. 
5. Coach- my coach isn’t the best. Is he the worst? no. But currently we don’t have an assistant coach, so he has a lot to take on.

Why i’m considering staying- 
1. Love for the sport- I’ve always loved swimming, i feel like this is what I was meant to do. But then again when i’m not performing well, I don’t feel like the same girl.
2. Friendships- I value the friendships I have made and enjoy the social aspect. 
3. A purpose- If I quit, am I going to struggle with my identity?
4. Ending on a bad note- Is it wrong to quit on a bad season?
5. What if I make improvements next year? for instance, what if the coaching staff gets better? or what if I’m just going through a hard adjustment to a new environment?
6. People who used to look up to me- Younger swimmers, old teammates, etc. Quitting after what it looks like was a bad season isn’t something that I like to think about.
7. New living situation- As a freshmen who lived with other people, my sleep and recovery wasn’t great. But next year, regardless of what I do, I plan to get my own bedroom/apartment. 
8. Was my swimming career supposed to be more than how it was this season?

61,1708781580.0,I have zero aerobic capacity and I’m terrified for college,"Context: I’ve been swimming since I was five, year round club swimming since I was seven. Three years ago I moved into the highest group my program offers. I’m committed to swim at an upper level D3 school. 

I’m a mid distance swimmer (200 fly, back, free & 500 free), but I train like a sprinter. Every set my coach puts on the board is anaerobic. I know I’ve lost the stamina I once had because of this. My breathing pattern has completely disappeared. I don’t pace as well as I used to, etc.

The only time we ever really do a distance over a 100 is during warm up when occasionally my coach will put up 4x200 free, which are actually painful for me to get through. We never swim aerobic stroke and do aerobic free maybe once a month. 

I’ve asked my coach for something simple like 10x100 or 5x200 best average, but he keeps telling me it’s not “the way this group trains.” His idea of a great main set is 30x25 on the :40. I would have switched teams, but the next closest club to me is 35 minutes away. 

I don’t want to look like an idiot or a fraud in front of my new coach, but I don’t know what to do. I can barely swim fast 200 unless it’s taper time and I’m super well rested, let alone more than one.

84,1708706166.0,Rash Guard for casual swim older person - long vs short sleeve .. drag and stability in water,"Need advice looking to buy a rash guard (not swim shirt), this is for an older casual female swimmer who feels the water is cold in the indoor pool (while the water temperature is right for a regular swimmer it's a bit cold for her). The rash guard would be worn on top of the regular one-piece swimsuit.

My assumption is the size has to be quite snag because they get baggy in the water.  Two questions:

1. Anybody experience with these rash guards? Aqua Sphere, Speedo, Oneill?  I don't feel like I want to spend money on all of them only to find the one that fits. Hope I can narrow down just by looking at criteria e.g. Oneill seems has best reputation but Speedo is almost in every online shope. Aqua Sphere has that little tag on the front bottom allowing it to be tied to swim suit bottom I guess in case the short gets too loose and baggy in water to prevent going up.
2. Recommendation long vs short sleeve? This is for indoor pool. How much drag will the long sleeve? Her arms are quite thin, so I am worried the long sleeves will get baggy in water an will cause a lot of drag when moving hands. Is the long sleeve more difficult to remove than the short sleeve when wet?

I had never dived off a block but my competitors were standing on them so I felt I had no choice. Dived into the water on the whistle, winded myself on landing, swallowed a ton of water and had to break into butterfly stroke... In reality, I was gasping to stay alive and just had to do a mixture of doggy-paddle inbetween attempts at the correct stroke.

101,1552749074.0,Don't do Underwaters Alone,"I'm a paramedic.

Last night, on duty, we were called to a local gym and indoor pool facility for a teenager found drowned in the pool.

He was alone. Nobody knew how long he'd been under. Some gym goers walking by noticed he was just floating under the water and grabbed him out. 

They did CPR, and thankfully, by the time I got there, he was wide awake but in a lot of pain. 

He admitted to me later that he was trying to swim long lengths underwater and his last memory was trying to come up for air and then nothing. 

He experienced a shallow water blackout. Essentially, when you are trying to do long distances underwater, you can hyperventilate to maximize your oxygen intake and blow off much of your CO2, thus reducing the feeling of 'i need to surface for air' during your laps. 

But what ends up happening sometimes, is that you overdo it, and you end up expelling too much CO2. Then, as you are doing your lap, your brain becomes oxygen deprived, but the CO2 level in your body is too low for your brain to signal you to breath. 

And, without any warning, lights go out. No slow fade into darkness, no slow feeling of passing out. No, you pretty much just go out in a matter of seconds.

...

At the hospital, my patient's father expressed shock to me that this happened to his kid. His kid is an incredible competitive swimmer, one of the best in his age group. It didn't make sense that he nearly drowned. He could understand some rookie, but his kid? In a pool that was maybe 5 feet deep?

Hey,

I’m absolutely embarrassed by this, but I’m a 26 year old adult female who can’t swim properly at all. I also have ptsd from the time I got pushed into the deep end of the pool by my swim instructor when I was learning at school, which changed my relationship with swimming forever. 

Every time I go on holiday and see people swimming I wish it was me! I still attempt to get in the pool but can only manage in shallow water (I wouldn’t call it proper swimming). Is there any hope for me? Can I still learn and be able to swim properly?

Thank you!",Swimming

296,1708631562.0,How Far Was Your First OWS?,"I've been swimming in a pool since December (roughly 3x/wk) and have gained a lot of endurance, technique, and efficiency.  Still, I realize I have a LONG way to go before I can confidently do a 1.5mi open water swim. 

I live in a colder climate this time of year and won't be able to get into a natural body of water until May at the earliest most likely.  

I do not want to set myself up for failure or have expectations that swimming in a pool will be the same as a lake.  In my pool it's a flat 3ft-4ft deep throughout and even with short lap turns, I touch the bottom of the pool to quickly catch my breath, which obviously isn't possible in OWS.  I'm not at the point where I can swim 30+ laps with flip turns yet. 

So how far did you make it on your first OWS?  Was it 5min, 10min?  Was it just 200-300yds?  I have no idea what to expect and trying to set my expectations as low as possible, so I don't lose the small amount of confidence I've gained.  Also intersted in hearing others on what their first OWS experience was and anything that wasn't expected.  FYI: My first OWS will NOT be a race! It will be me swimming alone with wife in kayak following me.

For a gauge of where I'm at currently, I can do roughly 2100-2300 yds in an hour session; and that's transitioning intermittent use of pool tools (fins, hand paddles, buoy).    ",Swimming

299,1708631701.0,Getting back into shape,"I have been swimming a couple nights a week at the YMCA near me for a couple months now.  I swam while growing up and in college (NAIA).  My last season was in 2020 but didn’t get to finish well because of COVID.  I graduated college and began working full time but didn’t make exercise a big part of my schedule past weekend hikes and getting into bouldering.  I was very burnt out from swimming after college but I began to miss the structure of it and how in shape I was while swimming.  I’m 25 now, I weigh about 210 and am 6’1”, I was around 180 lbs-190 lbs while swimming.  When I go to swim now I swim a mile split up into 200s and it takes me about 45 mins to an hour.  I’m wondering if anyone has suggestions on how to train in the pool with the goal of losing some extra weight.  It just feels more difficult going to the pool now without a coach giving me a set everyday.  TLDR: Are there resources with swim sets I could print out to bring to the pool?  I’d like to maximize the time spent in the pool with workouts that will get my heart rate up and wear me out so I can lose some weight.",Swimming

304,1708973696.0,Worst swimmer ever,I am probably the worst swimmer of all time. I started six months ago. I practice about five days a week.  Have been taking lessons. I still can't go across the pool freestyle  (25 meters) consistently.  Most of the time about 20 meters is about as far as I can go. I do pretty good backstroke but freestyle I just can't seem to get it. I know all about head position and how to breathe. It doesn't matter my legs start sinking as soon as my head moves to breathe even though I am doing it correctly. I am getting ready to take lessons with another teacher. Hoping that will help. I have become very frustrated. I am  no longer making any progress. I have invested a lot of time and money in this and not much to show for it.
